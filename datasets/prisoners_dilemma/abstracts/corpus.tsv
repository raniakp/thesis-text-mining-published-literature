"We use a laboratory experiment to examine the role of social preferences in simple one-shot social dilemma games by comparing play with and without a human counterpart. We find that cooperation rates are slightly lower without a human counterpart in all games we consider. However, the difference is small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that social preferences are not the primary driver of cooperation in one-shot social dilemma games.

"Across five studies using samples from both Japan and United States (N = 2345), we take a multi-method approach to test the prediction from life history theory that a slow, compared to fast, life history strategy promotes investment in cooperative relationships. Studies 1 and 2 examined how different measures as proxies for life history strategy (i.e., Mini-K and High-K Strategy Scale) relate to cooperation in various economic games. Studies 3 to 5 measured early childhood environments (i.e., childhood harshness and unpredictability), manipulated resource scarcity using previously validated methods, and then measured cooperation. Across our studies, we also examined four hypothesized psychological mechanisms that could explain the relation between life history strategy and cooperation: temporal discounting, concern for reputation, social value orientation, and trust in others. Overall, we found no support for the hypothesis that life history strategy predicts cooperation or that early childhood environments interact with current resource scarcity to predict cooperation. Thus, our initial findings imply that life history theory may not account for individual variation in cooperation with unknown others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This paper explores the effect of video game content, context and experience on cooperative behavior over three research studies. Study 1 is a cross-sectional correlation study exploring the relationship between the video game team-play frequency and pro-social behavior, Study 2 is a 2 (game content: violent video game and neutral video game) × 2 (game context: single-play and team-play) design with the dependent variable being cooperative behavior and Study 3 is a single factor design experiment which examines the effect of the gaming experience on cooperative behavior under a collaborative context. The main findings were that the team-play frequency had a positive correlation with pro-social behavior, and pro-social video game exposure significantly predicted pro-social behavior. Collaborative play was found to significantly increase cooperation in both violent and neutral video games. However, the level of gaming experience tended to moderate the relationship between collaborative play and the level of cooperation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Climate change has not only led to a sustained rise in mean global temperature over the past decades, but also increased the frequency of extreme weather events. This paper explores the effect of temperature shocks in utero on later-life taste for cooperation. Using historical climate data combined with data on child and adult behavior in public goods games, I show that abnormally high ambient temperatures during gestation are associated with decreased individual contributions to the public good in a statistically and economically significant way. A 1 standard deviation rise in mean ambient temperature during gestation is associated with a 10% point decrease in children's cooperation rate in a dichotomous public goods game, and the reduced taste for cooperation lasts into adulthood.

"This paper investigated the effect of risk orientation, game riskiness, and expectation of cooperation on cooperation in one-shot prisoner’s dilemmas (PD). Participants in pairs played PD games that varied on game riskiness such that for half of the games cooperation was more risky than defection (more risky games) while for another half cooperation was less risky (less risky games). They estimated how likely it was that the other player was going to cooperate (expectation of cooperation) before they made their cooperation/defection decision on each game. Supporting the Goal/Expectation Hypothesis, we replicated the effect that expectation of cooperation enhanced cooperation. We also found that risk-seeking individuals cooperated more in more risky games whereas risk-averse individuals cooperated more in less risky games. More importantly, we found that game riskiness moderated the effect of expectation of cooperation on cooperation. The positive effect of expectation of cooperation on cooperation was stronger for more risky games than for less risky games. Our results illustrated how the relation between expectation and cooperation as stipulated by the Goal/Expectation Hypothesis was moderated by riskiness of the situations.

"When groups compete for resources, some groups will be more successful than others, forcing out less successful groups. Group-level selection is the most extreme form of group competition, where the weaker group ceases to exist, becoming extinct. We implement group-level selection in a controlled laboratory experiment in order to study its impact on human cooperation. The experiment uses variations on the standard linear public goods game. Group-level selection operates through competition for survival: the least successful, lowest-earning groups become extinct, in the sense that they no longer are able to play the game. Additional control treatments include group comparison without extinction, and extinction of the least successful individuals across groups.We find that group-level extinction produces very high contributions to the provision of the public good, while group comparison alone or individual extinction fail to cause higher contributions. Our results provide stark evidence that group-level selection enhances within-group cooperation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We experimentally investigate a finitely repeated public goods game setting where, in each round, access to sanctioning power is exclusively awarded to one single player per group. We show that our central ‘Top Contributors as Punishers’ institution—a mechanism by which a player needs to be the highest contributor in her group in order to earn the right to sanction others—is extremely effective in raising cooperation and welfare due to turnover in the top contributor role and to top contributors’ willingness to substantially sanction others. Our findings yield implications for the design of mechanisms intended to foster cooperation in social dilemma environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Research on social dilemma has shown that the delegation of decision-making to group leaders can increase cooperation in the collective action problem. In this paper, we show that the voting scheme used for the election of leaders could make a difference to the emergence of cooperation. We design a public goods game experiment in which actors elect leaders to make decisions on their behalf in the contribution to public goods. In particular, we compare the leadership elected from direct and indirect election systems. In direct election, a leader is elected directly by majority-votes from a group, whereas in indirect election the group is divided into smaller subgroups and a leader is elected from the elected subgroup leaders. We run a simulation model to show that direct election would choose a more cooperative leader than indirect election when voters’ preferences of leadership are not homogenous. A laboratory experiment with human subjects further indicates that people hold stronger preferences for cooperators as leaders in direct election than in indirect election, suggesting that the voting scheme has an effect not only on the processing of actors’ preferences, but also on the shaping of their preferences of leadership in the public goods dilemma.

"This study evaluated the influence of self-reported levels of depression on interpersonal strategic decision making when interacting with partners who differed in their predetermined tendency to cooperate in three separate computerized iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Games (iPDGs). Across 29 participants, cooperation was lowest when interacting with a predominantly defecting partner and highest when interacting with a predominantly cooperating partner. Greater depression severity was related to steadier and continued cooperation over trials with the cooperating partner, seeming to reflect a prosocial response tendency when interacting with this partner. With the unbiased partner, depression severity was associated with a more volatile response pattern in reaction to cooperation and defection by this partner. Severity of depression did not influence cooperation with a defecting partner or expectations about partner cooperation reported before the task began. Taken together, these data appear to show that in predominately positive interactions, as in the cooperating partner condition, depression is associated with less volatile, more consistent cooperation. When such clear feedback is absent, as in the unbiased partner condition, depression is associated with more volatile behavior. Nonetheless, participants were generally able to adapt their behavior accordingly in this dynamic interpersonal decision making context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A sequential prisoner's dilemma game was combined with psychophysiological measures to examine the cognitive underpinnings of reciprocal exchange. Participants played four rounds of the game with partners who either cooperated or cheated. In a control condition, the partners’ faces were shown, but no interaction took place. The partners’ behaviors were consistent in the first three rounds of the game, but in the last round some of the partners unexpectedly changed strategies. In the first round of the game, the feedback about a partner's decision elicited a feedback P300, which was more pronounced for cooperation and cheating in comparison to the control condition, but did not vary as a function of feedback valence. In the last round, both the feedback negativity and the feedback P300 were sensitive to expectancy violations. There was no consistent evidence for a negativity bias, that is, enhanced allocation of attention to feedback about another person's cheating in comparison to feedback about another person's cooperation. Instead, participants focused on both positive and negative information, and flexibly adjusted their processing biases to the diagnosticity of the information. This conclusion was corroborated by the ERP correlates of memory retrieval. Successful retrieval of a partner's reputation was associated with an anterior positivity between 400 and 600 ms after face onset. This anterior positivity was more pronounced for both cooperator and cheater faces in comparison to control faces. The results suggest that it is not the negativity of social information, but rather its motivational and behavioral relevance that determines its processing.

"Cooperative behavior is often assumed to depend on individuals’ characteristics, such as altruism and reasoning ability. Evidence is mixed about what the precise impact of these characteristics is, as the subjects of study are generally randomly paired, generating a heterogeneous mix of the two characteristics. In this study we ex-ante create four different groups of subjects by factoring their higher or lower than the median scores in both altruism and reasoning ability. Then we use these groups in order to analyze the joint effect of the two characteristics on the individual choice of cooperating and on successful paired cooperation. Subjects belonging to each group play first 10 one-shot prisoner’s dilemma (PD) games with ten random partners and then three consecutive 10-round repeated PD games with three random partners. In all games, we elicit players’ beliefs regarding cooperation using an incentive compatible method. Individuals with high altruism are more optimistic about the cooperative behavior of the other player in the one-shot game. They also show higher individual cooperation and paired cooperation rates in the first repetitions of this game. Contrary to the one-shot PD games where high reasoning ability reduces the probability of playing cooperatively, the sign of the relationship is inverted in the first repeated PD game, showing that high reasoning ability individuals better adjust their behavior to the characteristics of the game they are playing. In this sense, the joint effect of reasoning ability and altruism is not linear, with reasoning ability counteracting the cooperative effect of altruism in the one-shot game and reinforcing it in the first repeated game. However, experience playing the repeated PD games takes over the two individual characteristics in explaining individual and paired cooperation. Thus, in a (PD) setting, altruism and reasoning ability significantly affect behavior in single encounters, while in repeated interactions individual and paired cooperation reach similarly high levels independently of these individual characteristics.

"People frequently have interactions where they are interdependent, but differ in the extent to which they have power and resources. Two forms of power are the control one has over the outcomes of others (responsibility) and the extent to which one's outcomes are controlled by others (dependence). With regard to resources, individuals may have more or less resources than others. Prior research on power shows that social dilemmas with higher dependence and higher responsibility illicit more cooperation, but does not show whether dependence or responsibility is the cause of the cooperation. In the first study, participants chose between cooperative and non-cooperative options in a series of Prisoner's Dilemma games (PDG) that varied in dependence and responsibility. It was found that more participants were cooperative in games that had a greater amount of dependence and slightly fewer participants cooperated in games that had a greater amount of responsibility. In Study 2, the games used also varied the amount of resources the participant had relative to the other decision maker. It was found that participants cooperated at the highest rate when they had a resource advantage, less when they had equal resources, and least when they had a resource disadvantage. In both studies the effects of dependence and resources were moderated by Social Value Orientation (SVO): the effects were strongest for people with a joint gain maximizing orientation (Js), weaker for those with an own gain maximizing orientation (Os), and non-significant for people with a relative gain maximizing orientation (Rs).

"What explains variability in norms of cooperation across organizations and cultures? One answer comes from the tendency of individuals to internalize typically successful behaviors as norms. Different institutional structures can cause different behavioral norms to be internalized. These norms are then carried over into atypical situations beyond the reach of the institution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such spillovers. First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner’s dilemmas. Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games. Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial, more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general. Furthermore, these effects are most pronounced among subjects who use heuristics, suggesting that intuitive processes play a key role in the spillovers we observe. Our findings help to explain variation in one-shot anonymous cooperation, linking this intrinsically motivated prosociality to the externally imposed institutional rules experienced in other settings.

"We provide evidence on how cooperation rates vary across payoff parameters in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), using four one-shot games that differ only in the payoffs from mutual cooperation. In our experiment, participants play only the PD game, and play the game once and only once, so there are no potential confounds or methodological issues. Our results show that higher monetary payoffs from cooperation are associated with substantially higher cooperation rates, which increase monotonically from 23% to 60%. Participants' beliefs about cooperation rates track closely actual cooperation rates: higher cooperation is expected from others when mutual cooperation payoffs are higher. This is true also for participants who, in a follow-up experiment, only make guesses about the choices of others. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We theoretically and experimentally examine the effects from adding a simple, empirically relevant action to a repeated partnership, the option to walk away. Manipulating both the value of the outside option, and its relative distribution among the partners, we examine the behavior of human subjects in a repeated prisoners’ dilemma. In particular, we examine the degree of cooperation and the form of punishments used. Our findings indicate that cooperation rates are broadly unaffected by the value of the common outside option, but that the selection of supporting punishments—in-relationship defections or walking-away—are dictated by individual rationality. In contrast to the symmetric results, when outside options for partners are asymmetric we find stark selection effects over cooperation, with the potential for very high and very low efficiency, dependent on the precise division rule.

"We consider the possibility that cooperation in a prisoner’s dilemma is fostered by people’s voluntary enhancement of their own vulnerability. The vulnerability of a player determines the effectiveness of possible punishment by the other. In the 'Gradual' mechanism, players may condition their incremental enhancements of their vulnerability on the other’s choices. In the 'Leap' mechanism, they unconditionally choose their vulnerability. In our experiment, subjects only learn to cooperate when either one of these mechanisms is allowed. In agreement with theory, subjects aiming for cooperation choose higher vulnerability levels in Gradual than in Leap, which maps into higher mutual cooperation levels.

"We provide an experimental investigation of the fair rule preference and its effect on anonymous cooperation, intending to test the hypothesis that people who exhibit high degrees of rule inequality aversion—consider 'equality and mutual obligation under the social contract' as justified, are disgusted with free-rider behavior in the public goods game and are more likely to be conditional cooperators and make conditional contributions. Based on experimental work related to rule-preferences Chlaß and Moffatt (Giving in dictator games: experimenter demand effect or preference over the rules of the game? (No. 2012, 044). Jena Economic Research Papers, 2012) and the public goods game Fischbacher et al. (Am Econ Rev 100(1):541–556, 2010), we designed a dictator game with the option of buying a veto (when the veto was purchased, the level of rule inequality decreased, making it an ultimatum game) to measure rule preference, i.e., rule inequality aversion, and conducted a two-stage public goods experiment to identify the cooperation preferences and repeated cooperation levels of participants. We investigated the relationship between rule preferences and cooperative preferences (conditional reciprocal preference) and tried to explain the adjustments people made when making repeated contributions of public goods (conditional cooperation behavior) from a rule preference perspective. The results show that: (1) Heterogeneous rule-inequality-aversion preferences are found in lab; (2) The stronger the rule-inequality-aversion preference is, the higher the probability is for the individual to become a conditional cooperator in public goods experiment; (3) Individuals who have stronger rule-inequality-aversion are more sensitive to the contributions that are deviated from the norm. Compared to the theory of conditional cooperation types, rule-inequality-aversion preference has a better explanation power when it comes to the behavior adjustment in repeated public goods contribution.

"In a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important. We present results from a comprehensive investigation of crosssocietal cooperation in one-shot prisoner’s dilemmas involving population-representative samples from six countries and identify crucial facilitators of and obstacles to cooperation. In interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players’ nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants’ cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner’s nationality. In the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations.

"In this paper, we show that Case-based decision theory, proposed by Gilboa and Schmeidler (Q J Econ 110(3):605–639, 1995), can explain the aggregate dynamics of cooperation in the repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, as observed in the experiments performed by Camera and Casari (Am Econ Rev 99:979–1005, 2009). Moreover, we find CBDT provides a better fit to the dynamics of cooperation than does the existing Probit model, which is the first time such a result has been found. We also find that humans aspire to a payoff above the mutual defection outcome but below the mutual cooperation outcome, which suggests they hope, but are not confident, that cooperation can be achieved. Finally, our best-fitting parameters suggest that circumstances with more details are easier to recall. We make a prediction for future experiments: if the repeated PD were run for more periods, then we would be begin to see an increase in cooperation, most dramatically in the second treatment, where history is observed but identities are not. This is the first application of Case-based decision theory to a strategic context and the first empirical test of CBDT in such a context. It is also the first application of bootstrapped standard errors to an agent-based model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Two separate bodies of work have examined whether culture affects cooperation in economic games and whether cooperative or non-cooperative decisions occur more quickly. Here, we connect this work by exploring the relationship between decision time and cooperation in American versus Indian subjects. We use a series of dynamic social network experiments in which subjects play a repeated public goods game: 80 sessions for a total of 1,462 subjects (1,059 from the United States, 337 from India, and 66 from other countries) making 13,560 decisions. In the first round, where subjects do not know if connecting neighbors are cooperative, American subjects are highly cooperative and decide faster when cooperating than when defecting, whereas a majority of Indian subjects defect and Indians decide faster when defecting than when cooperating. Almost the same is true in later rounds where neighbors were previously cooperative (a cooperative environment) except decision time among Indian subjects. However, when connecting neighbors were previously not cooperative (a non-cooperative environment), a large majority of both American and Indian subjects defect, and defection is faster than cooperation among both sets of subjects. Our results imply the cultural background of subjects in their real life affects the speed of cooperation decision-making differentially in online social environments.

We report three studies, using two different methods to measure betrayal aversion: a standard elicitation with monetary incentives and a novel scenario-based measure that we argue addresses concerns about the standard measure. We find strong and robust evidence of an association between conditional cooperation and betrayal aversion in the scenario-based measures but not in the standard measure.

"Cooperation is pervasive and constitutes the core behavioral principle of human social life. Previous studies have revealed that mutual cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study sought to investigate how the loss and gain contexts modulated the neural responses to mutual cooperation. Twenty-five female participants were scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner’s dilemma games in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of their choices. Behavioral results indicated that participants cooperated in nearly half of the experiment trials and reported higher level of positive emotions for mutual cooperation in both contexts, but they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation.

"Successful navigation of our complex social world requires the capability to recognize and judge the relative status of others. Hence, social comparison processes are of great importance in our interactions, informing us of our relative standing and in turn potentially motivating our behavior. However, so far few studies have examined in detail how social comparison can influence interpersonal decision-making. One aspect of social decision-making that is of particular importance is cooperative behavior, and identifying means of maintaining and promoting cooperation in the provision of public goods is of vital interest to society. Here, we manipulated social comparison by grading performance rankings on a reaction time task, and then measured cooperative decisions via a modified Public Goods Game (PGG). Findings revealed that individuals ranked highest tended to be more cooperative as compared to those who placed in the bottom rank. Interestingly, this effect was regardless of whether the comparison group members were the subsequent players in the PGG or not, and this effect was stronger in those with higher social orientation. In summary, the present research shows how different social comparison processes (assessed via social rankings) can operate in our daily interaction with others, demonstrating an important effect on cooperative behavior.

"The public goods game has been studied extensively in the lab as the quintessential model of a social dilemma. Several mechanisms have been demonstrated to promote group cooperation in linear voluntary contribution experiments—such as communication, costly punishment, and centralized bonuses and fines. However, lab experiments have largely neglected a central obstacle to efficient public good provision: Individuals typically have different, private demands for consumption, hindering the ability of either a central authority or the group members themselves to calculate and enforce the optimal behavior. I adapt the standard public goods game to incorporate heterogeneous incentives and provide an assessment of each mechanism in this richer environment. I find that baseline cooperation is similar to that in the standard linear game. Sanctions are weak and generally ineffective. Communication, however, does promote cooperation, especially when subjects are given the opportunity to reveal their demand or demand is observable. Finally, a centralized fine/bonus scheme is most effective at increasing contributions, but low demanders must pay a fine in equilibrium. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"It has recently been proposed that the evolution of human cooperativeness might, at least in part, have started as the cooptation of behavioral strategies evolved for solving problems of coordination to solve problems with higher incentives to defect, that is, problems of cooperation. Following this line of thought, we systematically tested human subjects for spillover effects from simple coordination tasks (2 × 2 stag hunt [SH] games) to problems of cooperation (2 × 2 prisoner’s dilemma [PD] games) in a laboratory experiment with rigorous controls to rule out subject confusion or habituation. Supporting the hypothesis that decision mechanisms for cooperation problems are linked with decision mechanisms for coordination, our main finding is that cooperation levels in PD games embedded in a sequence of SH games were significantly increased compared to a baseline sequence consisting only of PDs when subjects played in fixed pairs. No such effects could be found when players were randomly rematched each round. Additional findings include that this spillover effect cannot prevent a decay of cooperation over time, that there is no indication of a reversed effect (i.e., no signs of negative spillovers from failed cooperation to miscoordination), and that subjects’ self-reported preferences in SH games are prosocial.

"The present study serves to test whether the cognitive mechanisms underlying social cooperation are affected by cognitive load. Participants interacted with trustworthy-looking and untrustworthy-looking partners in a sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma Game. Facial trustworthiness was manipulated to stimulate expectations about the future behavior of the partners which were either violated or confirmed by the partners’ cheating or cooperation during the game. In a source memory test, participants were required to recognize the partners and to classify them as cheaters or cooperators. A multinomial model was used to disentangle item memory, source memory and guessing processes. We found an expectancy-congruent bias toward guessing that trustworthy-looking partners were more likely to be associated with cooperation than untrustworthy-looking partners. Source memory was enhanced for cheating that violated the participants’ positive expectations about trustworthy-looking partners. We were interested in whether or not this expectancy-violation effect—that helps to revise unjustified expectations about trustworthy-looking partners—depends on cognitive load induced via a secondary continuous reaction time task. Although this secondary task interfered with working memory processes in a validation study, both the expectancy-congruent guessing bias as well as the expectancy-violation effect were obtained with and without cognitive load. These findings support the hypothesis that the expectancy-violation effect is due to a simple mechanism that does not rely on demanding elaborative processes. We conclude that most cognitive mechanisms underlying social cooperation presumably operate automatically so that they remain unaffected by cognitive load.

"Previous findings on punishment have focused on deterministic environments in which the outcomes are known with certainty. In this article, we conduct experiments to investigate how punishment affects cooperation in stochastic social dilemmas where each person can decide whether to cooperate, when the outcomes of alternative strategies are specified probabilistically. Two types of punishment mechanisms are studied: (1) an unrestricted punishment mechanism—both persons can punish—and (2) a restricted punishment mechanism—only cooperators can punish noncooperators. We compare behavior in a two-person deterministic prisoner’s dilemma game (DPD) with a two-person stochastic prisoner’s dilemma (SPD). In all treatments, participants are given information on the other person’s actions. We find that in both games, the restricted punishment mechanism promotes more cooperative behavior than unrestricted punishment. However, the difference in the degree of effectiveness between the two mechanisms is smaller in the SPD game than in the DPD game because noncooperative behavior is less likely to be punished when there is outcome uncertainty. Our findings provide useful information for designing efficient incentive mechanisms to induce cooperation in a stochastic social dilemma environment.

Song provides a rich oscillatory framework that supports synchronous movement and may thus be considered a powerful agent of positive social relations.

Children participated in one of three activity conditions: group singing, group art, or competitive games. They were then asked to play a prisoner’s dilemma game as a measure of cooperation. Results showed that children who engaged in group singing were more cooperative than children who engaged in group art or competitive games.

"Economic experiments are often used to study if humans altruistically value the welfare of others. A canonical result from public-good games is that humans vary in how they value the welfare of others, dividing into fair-minded conditional cooperators, who match the cooperation of others, and selfish noncooperators. However, an alternative explanation for the data are that individuals vary in their understanding of how to maximize income, with misunderstanding leading to the appearance of cooperation. We show that (i) individuals divide into the same behavioral types when playing with computers, whom they cannot be concerned with the welfare of; (ii) behavior across games with computers and humans is correlated and can be explained by variation in understanding of how to maximize income; (iii)misunderstanding correlates with higher levels of cooperation; and (iv) standard control questions do not guarantee understanding. These results cast doubt on certain experimental methods and demonstrate that a common assumption in behavioral economics experiments, that choices reveal motivations, will not necessarily hold.

"The present study serves to test how positive and negative appearance-based expectations affect cooperation and punishment. Participants played a prisoner’s dilemma game with partners who either cooperated or defected. Then they were given a costly punishment option: They could spend money to decrease the payoffs of their partners. Aggregated over trials, participants spent more money for punishing the defection of likable-looking and smiling partners compared to punishing the defection of unlikable-looking and nonsmiling partners, but only because participants were more likely to cooperate with likable-looking and smiling partners, which provided the participants with more opportunities for moralistic punishment. When expressed as a conditional probability, moralistic punishment did not differ as a function of the partners’ facial likability. Smiling had no effect on the probability of moralistic punishment, but punishment was milder for smiling in comparison to nonsmiling partners.

"Playing a video game competitively or cooperatively may impact a player's behaviors and aggression after game play. Competition has been found to elicit increased aggression, and cooperation has been found to attenuate aggression and facilitate cooperative behaviors. However, the distinction between pure competition and team competition has been relatively unexplored. Team competition contains both competitive elements of game play and cooperative behaviors among teammates. Of interest is the effect of playing in varying degrees of team competition (high vs. low social disidentification with the outgroup) and pure competition on feelings of aggression and cooperative behaviors. A between-subjects experiment (N = 70) was conducted to examine the relationship among low disidentification, high disidentification, and pure competition for state hostility, affiliation, and cooperative behaviors. It was predicted that those in the low disidentification conditions would experience significantly lower hostility, but greater affiliation both for ingroup and outgroup members. Compared to pure competition and high disidentification, low disidentification resulted in significantly greater feelings of aggression. However, no level of disidentification or outcome affected cooperative behaviors after game play, as measured by a modified Prisoner's Dilemma task. The implications of the findings are discussed.

In Study 1, the GGG and a corresponding measurement model were experimentally validated using different payoff structures. Results show that in-group cooperation is the dominant behavior in a situation of mutual exclusiveness, whereas selfish behavior becomes more dominant in a situation of conflict. Study 2 examined personality influences on choices in the GGG. High Honesty-Humility was associated with less selfishness, whereas Openness was not associated with more PEB. Results corroborate the paradigm as a valid instrument for investigating the conflict between in-group cooperation and PEB and provide first insights into personality influences.

"Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to examine the predictive capabilities of sportspersonship, moral competence, and emotional intelligence on cooperation in varying competitive conditions. Design: An experimental study was conducted, examining responses in a prisoner's dilemma game with manipulated conditions. Method: Forty-three participants were randomly assigned to an accumulative or competitive condition, in which they contested 10 rounds of choosing to cooperate or defect. Results: Whether the condition was accumulative or competitive did not significantly predict cooperation. In the final round of each contest however, cooperation was significantly reduced. Sportspersonship predicted a significant amount of cooperation percentage, while final round cooperation was predicted by emotional intelligence. Conclusions: Cooperation is in part determined by individual levels of sportspersonship in all conditions except when actions are free of future consequence. In such conditions, emotional intelligence appears to be a stronger indicator of cooperation. The implications of the study are that researchers and practitioners should consider how to develop sportspersonship and emotional intelligence to boost cooperation in various domains.

"Three experiments tested the hypothesis that implicit preferences for racial ingroup members are reduced when external mechanisms are available to incentivize cooperation between individuals. Study 1 varied the presence (vs. absence) of a third-party punisher in a series of upcoming cross-group trust games. Studies 2 and 3 held the presence of a punisher constant, but varied the punisher’s likely effectiveness at incentivizing cooperation by manipulating the punisher’s group membership or whether the punisher’s presence was common knowledge. The results of S1 and S2 showed that anticipating an effective third party punisher reduced racial bias on an intervening evaluative priming measure. S3 was more equivocal, but overall (and as indexed by a multilevel meta-analysis) the findings across studies provide evidence for situational tuning of rapid evaluative responses as a function of contextually variable cooperative affordances.

"We study cooperation within and between groups in the laboratory, comparing treatments in which two groups have previously been in conflict with one another, in conflict with a different group, or not previously exposed to conflict. We model conflict using an inter-group Tullock contest, and measure its effects upon cooperation using a multi-level public good game. We find that conflict increases cooperation within groups, while decreasing cooperation between groups. Moreover, we find that an increase in the gains from cooperation only increases cooperation between groups when the two groups have not previously interacted.

"Despite the popularity of the notion that social cohesion in the form of dense social networks promotes cooperation in Prisoner’s Dilemmas through reputation, very little experimental evidence for this claim exists.We address this issue by testing hypotheses from one of the few rigorous game-theoretic models on this topic, the Raub & Weesie model, in two incentivized lab experiments. In the experiments, 156 subjects played repeated two-person PDs in groups of six. In the 'atomized interactions' condition, subjects were only informed about the outcomes of their own interactions, while in the 'embedded' condition, subjects were informed about the outcomes of all interactions in their group, allowing for reputation effects. The design of the experiments followed the specification of the RW model as closely as possible. For those aspects of the model that had to be modified to allow practical implementation in an experiment, we present additional analyses that show that these modifications do not affect the predictions. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that cooperation is higher in the embedded condition than in the atomized interaction. Instead, our results are consistent with an interpretation of the RW model that includes random noise, or with learning models of cooperation in networks.

"Decisions to cooperate are often delegated to a third party. We examined whether cooperation differs when decisions are made for a third party compared with ourselves and specified which motives are important for third-party cooperation. Participants played multiple rounds of a public goods game (PGG). In Study 1, we varied personal involvement from high to low; participants played for themselves (Self), for themselves and a third party (Shared), and solely for a third party (Third Party). Participants contributed most when personal involvement was lowest (i.e., Third Party) and least when personal involvement was high (i.e., Self). Study 2 explored if social motives underlie third-party cooperation by comparing cooperation with social (human) and non-social (computer) group members. Reducing personal involvement in the PGG (i.e., Third Party) increased cooperation in social contexts compared with non-social contexts, indicating enhanced collective interest. Increased cooperation for a third party may result from taking the other’s perspective, thereby increasing social norm preferences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Regardless of whether free will exists, believing that it does affects one’s behavior. When an individual’s belief in free will is challenged, one can become more likely to act in an uncooperative manner. The mechanism behind the relationship between one’s belief in free will and behavior is still debated. The current study uses an economic contribution game under varying time constraints to elucidate whether reducing belief in free will allows one to justify negative behavior or if the effects occur at a more intuitive level of processing. Here we show that although people are intuitively cooperative, challenging their belief in free will corrupts this behavior, leading to impulsive selfishness. If given time to think, however, people are able to override the initial inclination toward self-interest induced by discouraging a belief in free will.

"Anxiety disorders are characterized by hyperactivity in both the amygdala and the anterior insula. Interventions that normalize activity in these areas may therefore be effective in treating anxiety disorders. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential use of oxytocin (OT), as well as vasopressin (AVP) antagonists, as treatments for anxiety disorders. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmaco- fMRI study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to treatment with either 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP, or placebo and imaged with fMRI as they played the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game with same-sex human and computer partners. In men, OT attenuated the fMRI response to unreciprocated cooperation (CD), a negative social interaction, within the amygdala and anterior insula. This effect was specific to interactions with human partners. In contrast, among women, OT unexpectedly attenuated the amygdala and anterior insula response to unreciprocated cooperation from computer but not human partners. Among women, AVP did not significantly modulate the response to unreciprocated cooperation in either the amygdala or the anterior insula. However, among men, AVP attenuated the BOLD response to CD outcomes with human partners across a relatively large cluster including the amygdala and the anterior insula, which was contrary to expectations. Our results suggest that OT may decrease the stress of negative social interactions among men, whereas these effects were not found in women interacting with human partners. These findings support continued investigation into the possible efficacy of OT as a treatment for anxiety disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A contribution to a special issue on Hormones and Human Competition. In intergroup settings, individuals prefer cooperating with their in-group, and sometimes derogate and punish out-groups. Here we replicate earlier work showing that such in-group bounded cooperation is conditioned by oxytocin and extend it by showing that oxytocin-motivated in-group cooperation is intuitive rather than deliberated. Healthy males (N =65) and females (N =129) self-administered intranasal placebo or 24IU oxytocin in a double-blind placebo-controlled between-subjects design, were assigned to a three-person in-group (that faced a 3-person out-group), and given an endowment from which they could contribute to a within-group pool (benefitting the in-group), and/or to a between-group pool (benefitting the in-group and punishing the out-group). Prior to decision-making, participants performed a Stroop Interference task that was either cognitively taxing, or not. Cognitively taxed individuals kept less to themselves and contributed more to the within-group pool. Furthermore, participants receiving placebo contributed more to the within-group pool when they were cognitively taxed rather than not; those receiving oxytocin contributed to the within-group pool regardless of cognitive taxation. Neither taxation nor treatment influenced contributions to the between-group pool, and no significant sex differences were observed. It follows that in intergroup settings (i) oxytocin increases in-group bounded cooperation, (ii) oxytocin neither reduces nor increases out-group directed spite, and (iii) oxytocin-induced in-group cooperation is independent of cognitive taxation and, therefore, likely to be intuitive rather than consciously deliberated.

"Explaining cooperation remains a central topic for evolutionary theorists. Many have argued that group selection provides such an explanation: theoretical models show that intergroup competition could have given rise to cooperation that is costly for the individual. Whether group selection actually did play an important role in the evolution of human cooperation, however, is much debated. Recent experiments have shown that intergroup competitions do increase human cooperation, which has been taken as evidence for group selection as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Here we challenge this standard interpretation. Competitions change the payoff structure by creating a threshold effect whereby the group that contributes more earns an additional prize, which creates some incentive for individuals to cooperate. We present four studies that disentangle competition and thresholds, and strongly suggest that it is thresholds—rather than competitions per se—that increase cooperation. Thus, prior intergroup competition experiments provide no evidence of a unique or special role for intergroup competition in promoting human cooperation, and shed no light on whether group selection shaped human evolution.

"Purpose: The authors propose that angry individuals are much more likely to consider the emotional state of their partner than are neutral individuals. They then apply a lay theory dictating that anger decreases cooperation and react accordingly by lowering their own level of cooperation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors report four experiments involving different samples, manipulations, payment schemes and interfaces. The methodological approach was to capitalize on the positives of experimental research (e.g. establishing causality) while also trying to conceptually replicate the findings in different settings. Findings: The authors found evidence for a lay theory (i.e. expectation) that anger decreases cooperation, but that actual cooperation was lowest when angry individuals were paired with other angry individuals, supporting the hypotheses. Research limitations/implications: Anger can spill over from unrelated contexts to affect cooperation, and incidental anger by itself is not enough to decrease cooperation. However, the findings are limited to anger and cannot necessarily be used to understand the effects of other emotions. Practical implications: Before entering into a context that requires cooperation, such as a negotiation, be wary of the emotional state of both yourself and of your partner. This paper suggests that only if both parties are angry, then the likelihood of cooperation is low. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, they are the first researchers to address the question of how incidental anger affects single-round cooperation. By going back to the basics, the authors believe that the findings fill a gap in existing research and offer a building block for future research on anger and cooperation.

"If either property rights or institutions are weak, agents who create wealth by cooperating will later have an incentive to fight over the distribution of it. In this paper we investigate theoretically and experimentally the circumstances under which welfare losses from investment in distributional contests destroy welfare gains from voluntary cooperation. We find that in situations, where the return to cooperation is high, subjects cooperate strongly and welfare exceeds the predicted non-cooperation levels. If returns to cooperation are low, then subjects still cooperate, but the resources wasted in the distributional conflict lead to lower welfare than if subjects had followed the theoretical prediction of not cooperating.

"This research was the first experimental study to investigate the effect of video gaming on measures of cooperative behavior from an evolutionary standpoint. The final sample comprised a total 117 participants (39 male, 78 females), with a mean age of 24 years (SD = 8.93). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 media conditions (violent book, violent video game, nonviolent video game, and violent TV show) and measured on prosocial behavior before any media exposure and assessed on cooperative behavior after media exposure. Novice and regular gamers did not differ on prosocial behavior before gaming. After media exposure, a self-constructed version of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game was used to measure cooperation. Further analyses were then conducted to measure differences between conditions on cooperative behavior. It was found that regular and multiplayer gamers were not significantly higher or lower on measures of cooperative behavior compared to novices or solitary gamers. Although nonsignificant, effect sizes were consistent with past research which suggests heightened cooperation in regular gamers. Media type exposure did not have a significant effect on cooperative behavior. Findings suggest that cooperative behavior is not less prominent in regular or multiplayer gamers than novices or solitary gamers. These results indicate that, contrary to the predictions one may make from the GAM model of violent gaming (Anderson & Bushman, 2001), violent media exposure does not appear to produce reductions in prosocial or cooperative behavior.

"Social interaction is a fundamental part of our daily lives; however, exactly how our brains use social cues to determine whether to cooperate without being exploited remains unclear. In this study, we used an electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning approach to investigate the effect of face-to-face contact on the brain mechanisms underlying the decision to cooperate or defect in an iterated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Participants played the game either in face-to-face or face-blocked conditions. The face-to-face interaction led players to cooperate more often, providing behavioral evidence for the use of these nonverbal cues in their social decision-making. In addition, the EEG hyperscanning identified temporal dynamics and inter-brain synchronization across the cortex, providing evidence for involvement of these regions in the processing of face-to-face cues to read each other's intent to cooperate. Most notably, the power of the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz) in the right temporoparietal region immediately after seeing a round outcome significantly differed between face-to-face and face-blocked conditions and predicted whether an individual would adopt a ‘cooperation’ or ‘defection’ strategy. Moreover, inter-brain synchronies within this time and frequency range reflected the use of these strategies. This study provides evidence for how the cortex uses nonverbal social cues to determine other's intentions, and highlights the significance of power in the alpha band and inter-brain phase synchronizations in high-level socio-cognitive processing.

"We systematically explore the impact of transparency and punishment on cooperation in the provision of public goods. Motivated by problems of embezzlement, we study variations of a public goods game where one player (the official) may embezzle from an existing public good, while others (citizens) can only contribute. We show that transparency induces increased embezzlement in the absence of a punishment mechanism. The qualitative impact of transparency on contributions to the public good is reversed when a punishment mechanism is introduced. We identify stigmatization of the official when actions are not transparent. Only a combination of transparency of actions and peer-punishment options creates full accountability and increases contributions by all players.

"This paper compares behavior under four different implementations of infinitely repeated games in the laboratory: the standard random termination method [proposed by Roth and Murnighan (J Math Psychol 17:189–198, 1978)] and three other methods that de-couple the expected number of rounds and the discount factor. Two of these methods involve a fixed number of repetitions with payoff discounting, followed by random termination [proposed by Sabater-Grande and Georgantzis (J Econ Behav Organ 48:37–50, 2002)] or followed by a coordination game [proposed in (Andersson and Wengström in J Econ Behav Organ 81:207–219, 2012; Cooper and Kuhn in Am Econ J Microecon 6:247–278, 2014a)]. We also propose a new method—block random termination—in which subjects receive feedback about termination in blocks of rounds. We find that behavior is consistent with the presence of dynamic incentives only with methods using random termination, with the standard method generating the highest level of cooperation. Subject behavior in the other two methods display two features: a higher level of stability in cooperation rates and less dependence on past experience. Estimates of the strategies used by subjects reveal that across implementations, even when the discount rate is the same, if interactions are expected to be longer defection increases and the use of the Grim strategy decreases.

"Recent research has shown that making people’s decisions known to others may enhance cooperation in infinitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma games with random matching. This paper experimentally studies whether people can cooperate with each other by endogenously showing their identities and building cooperative reputations when there is an option to hide the identities. Our experiment shows that a non-negligible fraction of subjects choose to conceal their identities and accordingly subjects fail to cooperate with each other in communities if hiding is cost-free. However, almost all subjects disclose their identities and successfully achieve cooperation if a cost is charged for the act of hiding. This finding has a broad methodological implication for the study of reputation mechanisms when infinitely repeated games are used in an experiment, as people’s behavior may be determined by their ability to hide identities.

"In Step-Level Public Good (SPG) situations, groups of individuals can produce a public good if a sufficient number of them contribute. In SPG situations it is thus only rational for any group member to contribute if according to the beliefs of that group member her contribution is essential to the production of the public good. An individual's estimate of the impact of their contribution on the likelihood of public good production is known as their efficacy. The classic efficacy—cooperation hypothesis holds that individuals will be more likely to contribute if they estimate their contributions to be more necessary. Based on a game theoretical analysis of the SPG game, we contribute to the literature by identifying two distinct components of efficacy, viz. material efficacy and contextual efficacy. The former is based on objective characteristics of group members (such as resources, power, or skill) and the latter on beliefs about the material efficacy of other group members and expectations concerning their behavior. We present evidence from three experimental studies, showing how information on the distribution of material efficacy in the group can break the monotone material efficacy—cooperation relation. In addition, contrary to what one would expect based on both the efficacy—cooperation hypothesis and game theory, our results show that the effects of material efficacy are not mediated by contextual efficacy, both forms of efficacy having significant effects on behavior.game, we contribute (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Social dilemmas are characterized by conflicts between immediate self-interest and long-term collective goals. Although such conflicts lie at the heart of various challenging social interactions, we know little about how cooperation in these situations develops. To extend work on social dilemmas to child and adolescent samples, we developed an age-appropriate computer task (the Pizzagame) with the structural features of a public goods game (PGG). We administered the Pizzagame to a sample of 191 children 9 to 16 years of age. Subjects were led to believe they were playing the game over the Internet with three sets of two same-aged, same-sex co-players. In fact, the co-players were computer-generated and programmed to expose children to three consecutive conditions: (1) a cooperative strategy, (2) a selfish strategy, and (3) divergent cooperative–selfish strategies. Supporting the validity of the Pizzagame, our results revealed that children and adolescents displayed conditional cooperation, such that their contributions rose with the increasing cooperativeness of their co-players. Age and gender did not influence children and adolescents’ cooperative behavior within each condition. However, older children adapted their behavior more flexibly between conditions to parallel the strategies of their co-players. These results support the utility of the Pizzagame as a feasible, reliable, and valid instrument for assessing and quantifying child and adolescent cooperative behavior. Moreover, these findings extend previous work showing that age influences cooperative behavior in the PGG. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Decentralized punishment can maintain contributions to a public good at a high level. This positive effect holds even for situations involving inequality in punishment power, meaning that the relative costs for punishment differ between persons. We extend this line of research by examining the additional influence of instability of and thus potential competition for punishment power in public good experiments. As in previous research, inequality is operationalized by assigning the role of a ‘strong player’ to one group member, who can punish others at a reduced cost compared to other players. Instability is operationalized by the fact that the role assignment can change across rounds and is contingent on behavior in previous rounds. Three experiments show that under unequal, unstable (punishment‐) power, individuals behave more competitively and engage in a race for power resulting in detrimental effects for the group. Specifically, we find that (i) unstable power goes along with a disproportionate use of punishment; (ii) not inequality by itself but rather the combination of instability and inequality causes this effect; and (iii) this excessive use of punishment is found not only when the role of the strong player is assigned to individuals who previously behaved rather selfishly but also when prosocial behavior leads to the top, speaking for a generalizability of our findings. Implications for organizational settings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In a repeated public goods setting, we explore whether individuals, acting unilaterally, will provide an effective sanctioning institution. Subjects first choose independently whether they will participate in a sanctioning stage that follows a contribution stage. Only those who gave themselves the 'right' to sanction can do so. We find that the effectiveness of the institution may not require provision of the institution at the level of the group. Individuals acting unilaterally are able to provide sanctioning institutions that effectively raise cooperation. The effectiveness of the institution, however, depends on whether the 'right' to sanction entails a monetary cost or not. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"It is well-established that in finitely repeated linear public goods games, contributions decay over time with increasing free-riding. Prior researchers have appealed to notions of conditional cooperation coupled with self-interest to explain this phenomenon. We explore a complementary explanation for contributions falling over time. We show that there can be considerable heterogeneity in the distribution of initial beliefs among conditional cooperators, with subjects holding either optimistic or pessimistic beliefs regarding their peers’ cooperativeness. Therefore, what is often perceived as purely self-regarding behavior may well be 'conditional free-riding' by pessimistic reciprocators. These differences in prior beliefs, and subjects’ contribution choices in response to those differing priors, can also generate a process of decay over and above self-serving biases or the interaction between reciprocators and free-riders.

"Cooperation is fundamental to human societies, and one of the important paths for its emergence and maintenance is reciprocity. In prisoner’s dilemma (PD) experiments, reciprocal strategies are often effective at attaining and maintaining high cooperation. In many public goods (PG) games or n-person PD experiments, however, reciprocal strategies are not successful at engendering cooperation. In the present paper, we attribute this difficulty to a coordination problem against free riding among reciprocators: Because it is difficult for the reciprocators to coordinate their behaviors against free riders, this may lead to inequality among players, which will demotivate them from cooperating in future rounds.We propose a new mechanism, institutionalized reciprocity (IR), which refers to embedding the reciprocal strategy as an institution (i.e., institutionalizing the reciprocal strategy). We experimentally demonstrate that IR can prevent groups of reciprocators from falling into coordination failure and achieve high cooperation in PG games. In conclusion, we argue that a natural extension of the present study will be to investigate the possibility of IR to serve as a collective punishment system.

"Humans form impressions and make social judgments about others based on information that is quickly and easily available, such as facial and vocal traits. The evolutionary function of impression formation and social judgment mechanisms have received limited attention in psychology research; we argue that their function is to accurately forecast the behavior of others. There is some evidence for the predictive accuracy of social judgments, but much of it comes from situations where there is little incentive to deceive, which limits applicability to questions of the function of such mechanisms. A classic experiment that avoids this problem was conducted by R. H. Frank, T. Gilovich, and D. T. Regan (1993); their participants predicted each other's Prisoner's Dilemma Game decisions with above-chance accuracy after a short interaction period, knowing the game would follow. We report three original studies that replicate these aspects of the methods of Frank et al. (1993) and reanalyze data from all known replications. Our meta-analysis of these studies confirms the original report: humans can predict each other's Prisoner's Dilemma decisions after a brief interaction with people who have incentive to deceive.

"In many two-player games, players that invest in punishment finish with lower payoffs than those who abstain from punishing. These results question the effectiveness of punishment at promoting cooperation, especially when retaliation is possible. It has been suggested that these findings may stem from the unrealistic assumption that all players are equal in terms of power. However, a previous empirical study which incorporated power asymmetries into an iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game failed to show that power asymmetries stabilize cooperation when punishment is possible. Instead, players cooperated in response to their partner cooperating, and punishment did not yield any additional increase in tendency to cooperate. Nevertheless, this previous study only allowed an all-or-nothing–rather than a variable–cooperation investment. It is possible that power asymmetries increase the effectiveness of punishment from strong players only when players are able to vary their investment in cooperation. We tested this hypothesis using a modified IPD game which allowed players to vary their investment in cooperation in response to being punished. As in the previous study, punishment from strong players did not increase cooperation under any circumstances. Thus, in two-player games with symmetric strategy sets, punishment does not appear to increase cooperation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We let participants indicate their intended action in a repeated game experiment where actions are implemented with errors. Even though communication is cheap talk, we find that the majority of messages were honest (although the majority of participants lied at least occasionally). As a result, communication has a positive effect on cooperation when the payoff matrix makes the returns to cooperation high; when the payoff matrix gives a lower return to cooperation, communication reduces overall cooperation. These results suggest that cheap talk communication can promote cooperation in repeated games, but only when there is already a self-interested motivation to cooperate.

"Comparative payment schemes and tournament-style promotion mechanisms are pervasive in the workplace. We test experimentally whether they have a negative impact on people’s willingness to cooperate. Participants first perform in a simple task and then participate in a public goods game. The payment scheme for the task varies across treatment groups. Compared with a piece-rate scheme, individuals in a winner-takes-all competition are significantly less cooperative in the public goods game. A lottery treatment, where the winner is decided by luck, has the same effect. In a competition treatment with feedback, winners cooperate as little as participants in the other treatments, whereas losers cooperate even less. All three treatments lead to substantial losses in the realised social surplus from the public good while having no significant impact on performance. In a complementary experiment, we aim to shed light on the psychological mechanisms behind our results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Individuals differ in their motives and strategies to cooperate in social dilemmas. These differences are reflected by an individual’s social value orientation: proselfs are strategic and motivated to maximize self-interest, while prosocials are more trusting and value fairness.We hypothesize that when deciding whether or not to cooperate with a random member of a defined group, proselfs, more than prosocials, adapt their decisions based on past experiences: they ‘learn’ instrumentally to form a base-line expectation of reciprocity. We conducted an fMRI experiment where participants (19 proselfs and 19 prosocials) played 120 sequential prisoner’s dilemmas against randomly selected, anonymous and returning partners who cooperated 60% of the time. Results indicate that cooperation levels increased over time, but that the rate of learning was steeper for proselfs than for prosocials. At the neural level, caudate and precuneus activation were more pronounced for proselfs relative to prosocials, indicating a stronger reliance on instrumental learning and self-referencing to update their trust in the cooperative strategy.

"Two factors that promote cooperation are partner choice and punishment of defectors, but which option do people actually prefer to use? Punishment is predicted to be more common when organisms cannot escape bad partners, whereas partner choice is useful when one can switch to a better partner. Here we use a modified iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma to examine people’s cooperation and punishment when partner choice was possible and when it was not. The results show that cooperation was higher when people could leave bad partners versus when they could not. When they could not switch partners, people preferred to actively punish defectors rather than withdraw. When they could switch, punishment and switching were equally preferred. Contrary to our predictions, punishment was higher when switching was possible, possibly because cooperators could then desert the defector they had just punished. Punishment did not increase defectors’ subsequent cooperation. Our results support the importance of partner choice in promoting human cooperation and in changing the prevalence of punishment.

"Research on human cooperation as an evolutionary adaptation is largely based on results from the laboratory, e.g. public goods games. However, it is debated whether these results of human cooperative behavior extend beyond such settings and whether they are valid in other contexts. Critical issues include the absence of context, the very short period of play and possible observer effects. This article presents data from an alternative controlled, but context-rich setting—a public goods game in an online browser game—with around 18,000 players from five countries over a period of ten months without observer effects. This article focuses on the robustness of previous findings about cooperative strategies and whether different types of cooperative behavior extend beyond the laboratory setting. Thus, the data presented provides external validity to existing laboratory experiments. The results suggest some important qualifications to previous work, since less high cooperators and a differing proportion of conditional cooperation are found. However, this data confirms the reported proportion of free riders at about 25% of the population. Cooperative strategies appear to be stable over time, individually fixed and rather independent of environmental parameters. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We study experimentally how enforcement influences public goods provision when subjects face two free-rider options that roughly parallel the nonparticipation and noncompliance options available for countries in relation to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). Our results add to the MEA literature in two ways. First, they suggest that compliance enforcement will fail to enhance compliance in the absence of participation enforcement. Second, they indicate that compliance enforcement will boost compliance significantly in the presence of participation enforcement. Our results also add to the experimental literature on public goods provision, again in two ways. First, they reveal that previous experimental findings of enforcement boosting cooperation are valid only in settings with forced (or enforced) participation. Second, they show that subjects’ willingness to allocate costly punishment points is significantly stronger when the enforcement system permits punishment of both types of free riding than when it permits punishment of only one type.

"Behavioral and neuroscientific studies explore two pathways through which internalized social norms promote prosocial behavior. One pathway involves internal control of impulsive selfishness, and the other involves emotion-based prosocial preferences that are translated into behavior when they evade cognitive control for pursuing self-interest. We measured 443 participants’ overall prosocial behavior in four economic games. Participants’ predispositions [social value orientation (SVO)] were more strongly reflected in their overall game behavior when they made decisions quickly than when they spent a longer time. Prosocially (or selfishly) predisposed participants behaved less prosocially (or less selfishly) when they spent more time in decision making, such that their SVO prosociality yielded limited effects in actual behavior in their slow decisions. The increase (or decrease) in slower decision makers was prominent among consistent prosocials (or proselfs) whose strong preference for prosocial (or proself) goals would make it less likely to experience conflict between prosocial and proself goals. The strong effect of RT on behavior in consistent prosocials (or proselfs) suggests that conflict between prosocial and selfish goals alone is not responsible for slow decisions. Specifically, we found that contemplation of the risk of being exploited by others (social risk aversion) was partly responsible for making consistent prosocials (but not consistent proselfs) spend longer time in decision making and behave less prosocially. Conflict between means rather than between goals (immediate versus strategic pursuit of self-interest) was suggested to be responsible for the time-related increase in consistent proselfs’ prosocial behavior. The findings of this study are generally in favor of the intuitive cooperation model of prosocial behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Reputation plays a major role in human societies, and it has been proposed as an explanation for the evolution of cooperation. While the majority of previous studies equates reputation with a transparent and complete history of players’ past decisions, reputations in real life are often ambiguous and opaque. Using web-based experiments, we explore the extent to which opaque reputation works in isolating defectors, with and without partner selection opportunities. We found that low reputation works as a signal of untrustworthiness, whereas medium or high reputations are not taken into account by subjects for orienting their choices. Reputation without partner selection does not promote cooperative behavior; that is, defectors do not turn into cooperators only for the sake of getting a positive reputation. Finally, in a third study, when reputation is pivotal to selection, then a substantial proportion of would-be-defectors turn into cooperators. Taken together, these results provide insights about the characteristics of reputation and about the way in which humans make use of it when selecting partners, and also when knowing that they will be selected.

In Study 1 (N = 707), American participants who reported living under higher quality cooperation-enforcing institutions (police and courts) gave significantly more in a Dictator Game (DG), but did not punish significantly more in a Third-Party Punishment Game (TPPG). In Study 1R (N = 1705), we replicated the positive relationship between reported institutional quality and DG giving observed in Study 1. In Study 2 (N = 516), we experimentally manipulated institutional quality in a repeated Public Goods Game with a centralized punishment institution. Consistent with the correlational results of Study 1 and 1R, we found that centralized punishment led to significantly more prosociality in a subsequent DG compared to a no-punishment control, but had no significant direct effect on subsequent TPPG punishment (only an indirect effect via increased DG giving). Thus we present convergent evidence that the quality of institutions one is exposed to 'spills over' to subsequent prosociality but not punishment. These findings support a theory of social heuristics, suggest boundary conditions on spillover effects of cooperation, and demonstrate the power of effective institutions for instilling habits of virtue and creating cultures of cooperation.

"A classic problem in the literature on authority is that those with the power to enforce cooperation and proper norms of conduct can also abuse or misuse their power. The present research tested the argument that concerns about legitimacy can help regulate the use of power to punish by invoking a sense of what is morally right or socially proper for power-holders. We tested this idea in a laboratory experiment using public goods games in which one person in each group was selected to be a ‘‘designated punisher’’ who could give out material punishment that was either costly or costless to the punisher. Results show that costly punishment is perceived as more legitimate (proper) than costless punishment and that designated punishers engaged in more proper (‘‘prosocial’’) punishment and less abusive (‘‘antisocial’’) punishment when punishment was costly. These results highlight the importance of legitimacy in both motivating and regulating the enforcement of cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of using foreign languages on cooperative behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma setting. The cultural accommodation hypothesis suggests that people are less cooperative in English, associated with the Anglophone cultural cluster, than in French, which is – as is Belgium – associated with the more cooperative Latin European cultural cluster. Design/methodology/approach: Choices are framed as pricing strategies in the context of duopolistic competition. In total, 422 Flemish-Belgium participants with English and French as foreign and Dutch as their native language played in one of three language treatments. Findings: While the authors observe differences between the native and both foreign languages, which are moderated by gender, the authors do not find any difference in effects between the two foreign languages that are associated with different cultures. Extending cultural accommodation arguments, the data suggests an effect specific to the use of the two selected foreign languages. Originality/value: The authors contribute to this literature by reporting an experimental test of cultural accommodation and alienation effects related to two foreign languages. The authors explore novel arguments, related to cognitive psychology and gender effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Research on cooperation has contributed to a better understanding of the foundations of human social behavior. Most studies, however, have not considered fundamental social parameters such as an individual’s position in a social hierarchy. As a first step, this study investigates the modulating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on behavior and the physiological stress response. Study participants (n = 83) played a cooperative game with computerized coplayers of four categories: similar or higher SES in combination with either high or low fairness in behavior (i.e., willingness to cooperate). All participants showed a significant increase in saliva cortisol after the game compared to a control group. Only when paired with higher SES coplayers, however, did participants show a significant subsequent decrease in cortisol concentrations. Participants’ behavior in response to a coplayer’s decisions was only affected by the degree of fairness, but not the SES, of respective coplayers. Physiologically, playing this cooperation game was a big challenge for participants as measured by salivary cortisol. Yet, the high recovery rate when playing with cooperative, higher status individuals showed the stress-protective effects of positive social interactions in the framework of social hierarchies.

"We investigated how the type of resource, food (wafer) or non-food (sticker), age and sex influence cooperation in children. 251 children were tested in a public goods game during eight rounds in two experimental conditions: wafer or sticker condition. Wafers were all of the same kind but stickers were varied. The results indicated that 1) older children donated more stickers than younger children, but they did not differ in relation to wafer donations; and 2) sticker donations remained high along the rounds, while wafer donations decreased. We propose that different strategies may be adopted according to the quality, particularly to the diversity of the resource used, and the cost of cooperation may be overcome when it is more advantageous to wait for a future reward.

"This paper examines the relationship between public good game (PGG) contributions and cognitive abilities assessed by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). Employing two additional treatment conditions, the paper explores (i) whether CRT-scores are linked to preferences for cooperation or to a better understanding of the incentive structure; and (ii) the association between CRT-scores and contributions, if choices are elicited under time pressure. A time limit should make it harder for participants to base their choices on cognitive reflection. I find a strong and positive relationship between CRT-scores and contributions in a standard one-shot PGG. This relationship is fully moderated by the presence of time pressure. Thus, features of the decision environment can affect the link between cognitive abilities and PGG contributions. Finally, there is only a weak relationship between CRT-scores and the ability to understand the incentive structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A growing literature in experimental economics examines the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained in social-dilemma settings. In particular, several recent studies contrast cooperation levels in games in which the number of decision rounds is probabilistic to games in which the number of decision rounds is finite. We contribute to this literature by contrasting the evolution of cooperation in probabilistically and finitely repeated linear voluntary-contribution public-goods games (VCM). Consistent with past results, ceteris paribus, cooperation is found to increase in the marginal value of the public good. Additionally, as the number of decision sequences increases, there is a pronounced decrease in cooperation in the final round of finite sequences compared to those with a probabilistic end round. We do not, however, find consistent evidence that overall cooperation rates are affected by whether the number of decision rounds is finite or determined probabilistically.

"We experimentally investigate the role of information transparency for equilibrium selection in stag hunt coordination games. These games can be transformed from a prisoner’s dilemma game by introducing a centralized reward or punishment scheme. We aim to explore the impact of the disclosure of information on how final payoffs are derived on players’ incentive to coordinate on the payoff-dominant equilibrium. We find that such information disclosure significantly increases the tendency of players to play the payoff-dominant strategy and reduces the occurrence of coordination failure. The mechanism works directly through the positive impact of disclosure on the saliency of the payoff-dominant equilibrium, and indirectly through the positive influence of disclosure on players’ belief about the likelihood of cooperation by the opponent.

"We study the association among different sources of individual differences such as personality, cognitive ability and risk attitudes with trust and reciprocate behavior in an incentivized experimental binary trust game in a sample of 220 (138 females) undergraduate students. The game involves two players, player 1 (P1) and player 2 (P2). In the first stage, P1 decides whether to trust and let P2 decide, or to secure an egalitarian payoff for both players. If P1 trusts P2, the latter can choose between a symmetric payoff that is double than the secure alternative discarded by P1, and an asymmetric payoff in which P2 earns more than in any other case but makes P1 worse off. Before the main experiment, we obtained participants’ scores for Abstract Reasoning (AR), risk attitudes, basic personality characteristics, and specific traits such as psychopathy and impulsivity. During the main experiment, we measured Heart Rate (HR) and ElectroDermal Activity (EDA) variation to account for emotional arousal caused by the decision and feedback processes. Our main findings indicate that, on one hand, P1 trust behavior associates to positive emotionality and, specifically, to the extraversion’s warmth facet. In addition, the impulsivity facet of positive urgency also favors trust behavior. No relation to trusting behavior was found for either other major personality aspects or risk attitudes. The physiological results show that participants scoring high in psychopathy exhibit increased EDA and reduced evoked HR deceleration at the moment in which they are asked to decide whether or not to trust. Regarding P2, we find that AR ability and mainly low disagreeable disinhibition favor reciprocal behavior. Specifically, lack of reciprocity significantly relates with a psychopathic, highly disinhibited and impulsive personality. Thus, the present study suggests that personality characteristics would play a significant role in different behaviors underlying cooperation, with extraversion/positive emotionality being more relevant for initiating cooperation, and low disagreeable disinhibition for maintaining it.

"Background: Depression is a disabling disorder that significantly impacts on the interpersonal functioning of individuals. However, little is known about the neural substrates of such difficulties. In the last few years neuroeconomics, which combines imaging with multiplayer behavioural economic paradigms, has been used to study the neural substrates of normal and abnormal interpersonal interactions. Method: This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural activity in unmedicated depressed participants (n = 25) and matched healthy controls (n = 25). During scanning, participants played a behavioural economic game, the Prisoner's Dilemma. In this game, the participant and a co-player independently choose either to cooperate or not cooperate with each other. Results: Depressed participants reported higher levels of negative feelings (betrayal, guilt) during the game than did controls. Neural activation was compared between ‘imbalanced’ events [when one of the players cooperated and the other defected (‘CD’ and ‘DC’)] and ‘draw’ events [when both players either cooperated or defected (‘CC’ and ‘DD’)]. Participants preferentially activated the anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region implicated in cognitive control and regulation of emotions. Importantly, compared to controls depressed participants showed reduced activation in the left DLPFC, with the extent of signal reduction correlating with increased self-report feelings of guilt associated with DC outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that depression is associated with reduced activation of the DLPFC during social events that involve unreciprocated cooperation. This abnormality may underlie anomalies in cognitive control and top-down regulation of emotions during challenging social exchanges. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Human beings have a general tendency for reciprocity in most societies. The internalized reciprocity norm assumption suggests that reciprocity disposition would encourage reciprocity towards strangers in one-shot interactions. To verify this, we examined the predictive ability of reciprocity dispositions for giving and repaying reciprocal behaviors. A sample of college students (N = 98) participated in the reciprocity game in a laboratory, which comprised a prisoner dilemma game (PD) and dictator game (DG). The results indicated that reciprocity behavior occurred among strangers without face-to-face interactions. Reciprocity expectation predicted the choice of cooperation in the PD significantly. Positive and negative reciprocity dispositions had no effect on the strategy choice; however, they significantly predicted payoff allocation in the DG. Specifically, a higher positive reciprocity disposition led to more payoff allocation, while a higher negative reciprocity disposition led to less payoff allocation. In summary, strangers abide by the reciprocity norm, and the internalized reciprocity disposition exerts an influence on repaying behavior and accounts for some individual differences in reciprocity. These findings provide robust support for the internalized reciprocity norm assumption, and illustrate the process mechanism of human interaction among strangers. People may predict interpersonal interaction better through reciprocity dispositions and reciprocity valences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Research has shown that reciprocation increases individuals' willingness to cooperate. This study investigates how individuals learn to cooperate with reciprocating opponents. To do so, we evaluated individuals' expectations about the behavior of their opponents during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD). In four experiments, participants played with a Tit-For-Tat (TFT) algorithm that occasionally failed to reciprocate. In Experiment 1, we first established whether individuals actually develop expectations about their opponents by utilizing a concurrent task. Our results indicate that when the opponents did not reciprocate, participants engaged in greater cognitive processing and were slower to respond to the concurrent task. Experiment 2 examined whether delayed reciprocation affects expectations about reciprocation using similar methodology. Our results indicate that expectations were weaker when reciprocation was delayed. In Experiment 3, we investigated two possible paths through which people may learn to cooperate with TFT. Specifically, we investigated whether the expectations people develop concern their own payoffs or the behavior of their opponents. Our results indicate that participants' expectations concern both their own payoffs and opponents' behavior. In Experiment 4, we sought for convergent evidence and a finer temporal resolution by employing pupillometry. Our results indicate that participants exhibited greater pupil sizes when expectations about reciprocation were violated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This dissertation consists of three chapters researching how individuals behave in game-theoretic situations. Chapter 1 investigates how different fairness concerns impact individual decisions to cooperate. I introduce a new version of the sequential prisoners dilemma where there is a chance the first movers choice is reversed. Experimental results show that second mover cooperation is higher when the first mover has little control over their choice and when the second mover is not told what the first mover chose. While subject behavior is consistent with concerns for fairness, the results indicate that these concerns work in ways not predicted by current theoretical models. Chapter 2 studies how prior ownership can in?uence bargaining over a jointly produced surplus. Experiments varied whether the proposer or responder received the surplus prior to bargaining and the strength of punishment. The results suggest that proposers respect prior ownership when the responder has a strong ability to punish, but not when punishment is weak. Responders respect prior ownership when their ability to punish is weak, but reject at high rates when they have strong punishment. I show that an independent measure of rule following can explain the results suggesting that individual behavior in bargaining is driven in part by adherence to social norms. Chapter 3 explores how guilt, shame, and theory of mind (ToM) in?uence adherence to social norms. Using psychometric measures, I explore how guilt, shame, and ToM are related to following prior ownership norms in a bargaining experiment. Guilt was not predictive of behavior; however, both shame and ToM were. Individuals who had greater feelings of shame were much more likely to respect prior ownership of responders and punish proposers who transgressed prior ownership of responders. Individuals who scored higher in ToM were much more likely to respect prior ownership by proposer. These results suggest that individual differences in shame and ToM are important in understanding adherence to bargaining norms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Encouraging cooperation among selfish individuals is crucial in many real-world systems, where individuals’ collective behaviors can be analyzed using evolutionary public goods game. Along this line, extensive studies have shown that reputation is an effective mechanism to investigate the evolution of cooperation. In most existing studies, participating individuals in a public goods game are assumed to contribute unconditionally into the public pool, or they can choose partners based on a common reputation standard (e.g., preferences or characters). However, to assign one reputation standard for all individuals is impractical in many real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce a reputation tolerance mechanism that allows an individual to select its potential partners and decide whether or not to contribute an investment to the public pool based on its tolerance to other individuals’ reputation. Specifically, an individual takes part in a public goods game only if the number of participants with higher reputation exceeds the value of its tolerance. Moreover, in this paper, an individual’s reputation can increase or decrease in a bounded interval based on its historical behaviors.We explore the principle that how the reputation tolerance and conditional investment mechanisms can affect the evolution of cooperation in spatial lattice networks. Our simulation results demonstrate that a larger tolerance value can achieve an environment that promote the cooperation of participants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

To do so, we developed a cognitive-affective measure of subjective insecurity. We found that subjective insecurity has a negative effect on cooperation but influences trust and altruism positively. In Study 2, carried out three years after Study 1, we repeated the initial design with additional measures of victimization. Our goal was to relate subjective insecurity with actual victimization. The findings of Study 2 support the initial results, and are robust and consistent for cooperative behavior and trust when including victimization as a mediator. Different indicators of victimization are positively correlated with subjective insecurity and an aggregate index of victimization has a negative effect on cooperation but exerts a positive influence on trust.

"Reciprocity is an important factor in human–human interaction, so it can be expected that it should also play a major role in human–robot interaction (HRI). Participants in our study played the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (RPDG) and the mini Ultimatum Game (mUG) with robot and human agents, with the agents using either Tit for Tat (TfT) or Random strategies. As part of the study we also measured the perceived personality traits in the agents using the TIPI test after every round of RPDG and mUG. The results show that the participants collaborated more with humans than with a robot, however they tended to be equally reciprocal with both agents. The experiment also showed the TfT strategy as the most profitable strategy; affecting collaboration, reciprocation, profit and joint profit in the game. Most of the participants tended to be fairer with the human agent in mUG. Furthermore, robots were perceived as less open and agreeable than humans. Consciousness, extroversion and emotional stability were perceived roughly the same in humans and robots. TfT strategy became associated with an extroverted and agreeable personality in the agents. We could observe that the norm of reciprocity applied in HRI has potential implications for robot design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Former athletic employees receive a better wage when hired than other employees because recruiters associate positive values to athletic participation. Whereas athletes are considered as more cooperative than others, this assumption lacks empirical support. We implement a laboratory experiment in order to examine whether athletes (i.e., individuals engaged in intense athletic participation) exhibit more cooperative behaviours than nonathletes. We compare the cooperative behaviours of athletes and nonathletes in a single‐shot public good game using a variant of the strategy method. We find that athletes exhibit significantly more conditional cooperative behaviours than nonathletes but no significant differences in unconditional behaviours.

"The present manuscript addresses how perceived trustworthiness of cooperative partners in a social dilemma context is influenced by the moral judgments those partners make on Trolley-type moral dilemmas; an issue recently investigated by Everett, Pizarro, and Crockett (2016). The present research comprises 2 studies that were conducted independently, simultaneously with, and incognizant of the Everett studies. Whereas the present studies aimed at investigating the same research hypothesis, a different and more elaborate methodology was used, as such providing a conceptual replication opportunity and extension to the Everett et al. studies. Overall, the present studies clearly confirmed the main finding of Everett et al., that deontologists are more trusted than consequentialists in social dilemma games. Study 1 replicates Everett et al.’s effect in the context of trust games. Study 2 generalizes the effect to public goods games, thus demonstrating that it is not specific to the type of social dilemma game used in Everett et al. Finally, both studies build on these results by demonstrating that the increased trust in deontologists may sometimes, but not always, be warranted: deontologists displayed increased cooperation rates but only in the public goods game and not in trust games.

"The aim of this paper is to examine how framing influences people’s cooperation behavior in social dilemmas. In Experiment 1 we investigated the influence of outcome valence (positive vs. negative outcome) and externality valence (positive vs. negative externality) framing on players’ willingness to cooperate in a repeated public good game. We found a significant interaction effect on first-round cooperation, indicating larger cooperation rates when there is a negative outcome valence and a positive externality on others. Furthermore, this effect remained largely stable when comparing cooperation over all rounds, resulting in 45–63% increased cooperation compared to the other conditions. In Experiment 2 we replicated the effect in an applied vignette study, lending support for the generalizability of this framing effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that public goods provisions may be increased substantially by framing the situation’s outcome valence as negative rather than positive.

"Individuals often make decisions that affect groups, yet the propensities of group representatives are not as well understood than those of independent decision makers or deliberating groups. We ask how responsibility for group payoffs—in the absence of group deliberation—affects the choice. The experiment utilizes the Interdependent Security Dilemma paradigm. In its deterministic version, the game is identical to a finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma. In the stochastic version, potential losses are larger but uncertain, occurring with a predefined probability when one or both players choose to forgo investment in protection. Participants were assigned to play either as individuals, or as representatives of three‐person groups, with each member's choices equally likely to determine the group's payoffs. In the deterministic condition, individuals were more likely to invest (cooperate) than group representatives (80% vs. 62% of rounds). In the stochastic condition, the pattern was reversed as representatives were slightly, but not significantly, more likely to invest than individuals (46% vs. 40%). The significant interaction effect suggested that group representatives were not only less cooperative but also more risk averse than individuals. A follow‐up study supported this account by showing participants who construed the invest strategy as low‐risk than those who perceived this strategy to be high risk. Overall, group representatives exhibited a tendency to act more competitively and more cautiously than individuals acting alone. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Studies show that synchronizing movements with others encourages a collective social identity, leading to increased cooperation within a group. The current study investigated whether movement synchrony impacts social categorization and cooperation across intergroup boundaries. Two 3-person groups were brought together under movement synchrony conditions designed to emphasize different social categorizations of the aggregate: all individuals moved to the same beat, each minimal group moved to a different beat, or each individual moved to a different beat. Results demonstrate that movement synchrony influenced social categorization and cooperation across intergroup boundaries. Implications for approaches to intergroup relations using movement synchrony are noted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Leadership mechanisms provide a potential means to mitigate social dilemmas, but empirical evidence on the success of such mechanisms is mixed. In this paper, we explore the institutional frame as a relevant factor for the effectiveness of leadership. We compare subjects’ behavior in public-goods experiments that are either framed positively (give-some game) or negatively (take-some game). We observe that leader and follower decisions are sensitive to the institutional frame. Leaders contribute less in the take-some game, and the correlation between leaders’ and followers’ contribution is weaker in the take-some game. Additionally, using a strategy method to elicit followers’ reactions at the individual level, we find evidence for the malleability of followers’ revealed cooperation types. Taken together, the leadership institution is found to be less efficient in the take- than in the give-frame, both in games that are played only once and repeatedly.

"The goal of the study was to determine if people's endorsement of different moral foundations influences their degree of prosocial behavior in a set of economic exchange games. Moral Foundations Theory has proven to be a useful means of categorizing ideas about morality and predicting opinions on aspects of social justice, political orientation, and other constructs related to prosocial behavior. This study sought to determine if Progressivism, the degree to which individuals endorse the individualizing moral foundations (i.e., Harm/Care and Fairness/Reciprocity) over the binding moral foundations (i.e., In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity), would lead to more frequent cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, a higher level of investment in the Trust Game, a higher level of return of one's partner's investment in the Trust Game, and fewer points stolen in the Thieves' Game. The results indicated no relationship between Progressivism and performance in the Thieves' Game. In three separate linear regressions controlling for age, gender, race, and Big-5 personality traits Progressivism was associated with more frequent cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, a higher level of investment in the Trust Game, and a higher level of return of one's partner's investment in the Trust Game. Therefore it does appear that moral foundations do predict performance in economic exchange games and that a greater endorsement of Progressivism is associated with more prosocial behavior.

"Successful cooperation requires that humans can flexibly adjust choices to their partner’s behaviour. This, in turn, presupposes a representation of a partner’s past decisions in working memory. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of working memory processes in cooperation. For that purpose, we tested the effects of working memory updating (Experiment 1) and working memory maintenance demands (Experiments 2 and 3) on cooperative behaviour in the Prisoner’s dilemma game. We found that demands on updating, but not maintenance, of working memory contents impaired strategy use in the Prisoner’s dilemma. Thus, our data show that updating a partner’s past behaviour in working memory represents an important precondition for strategy use in cooperation.

"Human behavior in social dilemmas is strongly framed by the social context, but the mechanisms underlying this framing effect remain poorly understood. To identify the behavioral and neural responses mediating framing of social interactions, participants underwent functional MRI while playing a prisoner’s dilemma game. In separate neuroimaging sessions, the game was either framed as a cooperation game or a competition game. The framing of social decisions engaged the hippocampal formation, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and lateral temporal gyrus. Among these regions, the engagement of the left hippocampus was further modulated by individual differences in empathy. Social decisions not adhering to the frame were associated with stronger engagement of the angular gyrus and trend increases in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior intraparietal cortex, and temporopolar cortex. Our findings provide the first insight into the mechanisms underlying framing of behavior in social dilemmas, indicating increased engagement of the hippocampus and neocortical areas involved in memory, social reasoning, and mentalizing when participants make decisions that conform to the imposed social frame.

"The ability to perceive and infer the meaning of facial expressions has been considered a critical component of emotional intelligence being essential for successful social functioning: Longitudinal findings suggest that the ability to recognize emotion cues is related to positive social interactions. Moreover, pronounced recognition abilities for at least some emotions facilitate prosocial behavior in everyday situations. Integrating paradigms from behavioral economics and psychometrics, we used an interdisciplinary approach to study the relationship between prosociality as trait cooperativeness and the ability to recognize emotions in others. We measured emotion recognition accuracy (ERA) using a multivariate test battery. We captured prosocial behavior in standard socio-economic games, along with spontaneous emotion expressions. Structural equation modeling revealed no significant relationship between overall ERA and prosocial behavior. However, modeling emotion-specific factors suggested that more prosocial individuals are better in recognizing fear and tend to express more spontaneous emotions during the prisoner's dilemma. In all, cooperative individuals seem to be more sensitive to the distress of others and more expressive, possibly fostering reciprocal interactions with like-minded others.

"We investigate if the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), known to moderate social behaviour, influences strategic decision making in social dilemmas by facilitating the integration of incentives and social cues. Participants (N = 29) played two economic games with different incentive structures in the fMRI scanner after receiving OT or placebo (following a double blind, within-subject design). Pictures of angry or neutral faces (the social cues) were displayed alongside the game matrices. Consistent with a priori hypotheses based on the modulatory role of OT in mesolimbic dopaminergic brain regions, the results indicate that, compared to placebo, OT significantly increases the activation of the nucleus accumbens during an assurance (coordination) game that rewards mutual cooperation. This increases appetitive motivation so that cooperative behaviour is facilitated for risk averse individuals. OT also significantly attenuates the amygdala, thereby reducing the orienting response to social cues. The corresponding change in behaviour is only apparent in the chicken (or anti-coordination) game, where aggression is incentivized but fatal if the partner also aggresses. Because of this ambiguity, decision making can be improved by additional information, and OT steers decisions in the chicken game in accordance with the valence of the facial cue: aggress when face is neutral; retreat when it is angry. Through its combined influence on amygdala and nucleus accumbens, OT improves the selection of a cooperative or aggressive strategy in function of the best match between the incentives of the game and the social cues present in the decision environment.

"In an anonymous 4-person economic game, participants contributed more money to a common project (i.e., cooperated) when required to decide quickly than when forced to delay their decision (Rand, Greene & Nowak, 2012), a pattern consistent with the social heuristics hypothesis proposed by Rand and colleagues. The results of studies using time pressure have been mixed, with some replication attempts observing similar patterns (e.g., Rand et al., 2014) and others observing null effects (e.g., Tinghög et al., 2013; Verkoeijen & Bouwmeester, 2014). This Registered Replication Report (RRR) assessed the size and variability of the effect of time pressure on cooperative decisions by combining 21 separate, preregistered replications of the critical conditions from Study 7 of the original article (Rand et al., 2012). The primary planned analysis used data from all participants who were randomly assigned to conditions and who met the protocol inclusion criteria (an intent-to-treat approach that included the 65.9% of participants in the time-pressure condition and 7.5% in the forced-delay condition who did not adhere to the time constraints), and we observed a difference in contributions of −0.37 percentage points compared with an 8.6 percentage point difference calculated from the original data. Analyzing the data as the original article did, including data only for participants who complied with the time constraints, the RRR observed a 10.37 percentage point difference in contributions compared with a 15.31 percentage point difference in the original study. In combination, the results of the intent-to-treat analysis and the compliant-only analysis are consistent with the presence of selection biases and the absence of a causal effect of time pressure on cooperation.

"Using an appropriation game setting, we examine individual responses to changes in a groups’ vulnerability to a probabilistic loss (L) of a public good. The probabilistic loss parameter entails losing 10, 50 or 90% of the value of the public good that is maintained through cooperation, where the likelihood of the loss decreases in total group cooperation. By design, the expected marginal net benefits to an individual and the expected harm to others depends endogenously on the individuals’ expectations of group cooperation and exogenously on the magnitude of the loss parameter. We find that individual cooperation is greater when forecasts of total group cooperation are greater and where the magnitude of the probabilistic loss is larger. There is, however, an interesting asymmetry in responses by two subgroups. Subjects who are pessimistic regarding total group cooperation decrease cooperation the higher the magnitude of the probabilistic loss and their decisions are tied systematically to changes in their expectations of other’s cooperation. On the other hand, subjects who are optimistic regarding total group cooperation are found to be more cooperative, but their decisions are not systematically tied to changes in expectations of others’ cooperation.

"Efficient brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are in need of knowledge about the human brain and how it interacts, plays games, and socializes with other brains. A breakthrough can be achieved by revealing the microfoundations of sociality, an additional component of the utility function reflecting the value of contributing to group success derived from social identity. Building upon our previous behavioral work, we conduct a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N = 10 in the Pilot Study and N = 15 in the Main Study) to measure whether and how sociality alters the functional activation of and connectivity between specific systems in the brain. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that sociality, even in a minimal form, serves as a natural mechanism of sustainable cooperation by fostering interaction between brain regions associated with social cognition and those related to value calculation. We use group-based manipulations to induce varying levels of sociality and compare behavior in two social dilemmas: Prisoner’s Dilemma and variations of Ultimatum Game. We find that activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, a region previously associated with cognitive control and modulation of the valuation system, is correlated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to a greater degree when participants make economic decisions in a game with an acquaintance, high sociality condition, compared to a game with a random individual, low sociality condition. These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism through which sociality facilitates cooperation, fairness and provision of public goods at the cost of individual gain. Future research should examine neural dynamics in the brain during the computation of utility in the context of strategic games that involve social interaction for a larger sample of subjects.

"By many accounts cooperation appears to be a default strategy in social interaction. There are, however, several documented instances in which reflexive responding favors aggressive behaviors: for example, interactions with out-group members. We conduct a rigorous test of potential boundary conditions of intuitive prosociality by looking at whether intuition favors cooperation even towards competitive out-group members, and even in losses frames. Moreover, we address three major methodological limitations of previous research in this area: a lack of an unconstrained control condition; non-compliance with time manipulations leading to high rates of exclusions and thus a selection bias; and non-comprehension of the structure of the game. Even after eliminating participant selection bias and non-comprehension, we find that deliberation decreases cooperation: even in competitive contexts towards out-groups and even in a losses frame, though the differences in cooperation between groups was consistent across conditions. People may be intuitive cooperators, but they are not intuitively impartial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Women are often believed to be more cooperative and less egoistic than men. In the present study, we examined whether people punish women for failing to live up to these benevolent gender stereotypes. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma game with female and male partners who either cooperated or defected. Participants were offered a costly punishment option. They could spend money to decrease the payment of their partners. In Experiment 1, participants spent more money to punish the defection of female in comparison to male partners, but this effect of partner gender on punishment was indirect rather than direct: Participants were more likely to cooperate with female partners than with male partners, which gave them more opportunity for moralistic punishment. In Experiments 2 and 3, we examined the effects of the participants' own gender on cooperation and punishment of female and male partners. Female participants cooperated more with female partners than with male partners while male participants treated female and male partners equally. We conclude that the effect of facial gender on punishment are indirect rather than direct. The results also showed that women, in contrast to men, tended to make decisions that can be considered more social and less rational from an economic point of view, consistent with social‐role theory and evolutionary accounts.

"Despite secular trends in some countries, prestige-based authority in the form of religious leadership remains hugely influential in the everyday lives of millions of people around the world. Here, the costs and benefits of religious leadership are explored in an urban setting in northeastern Brazil. An economic game, within-group cooperation questionnaires, and social network analyses were carried out among adherents of an Afro-Brazilian religion. Results reveal that leaders display high levels of religious commitment and disproportionally provide cooperative services to group members. On the other hand, initiates cooperate less than leaders but do not differ in levels of received cooperation or social cohesion measures. This may indicate some level of exploitation or free-riding. Demographic and group variables also appear to play an important role in the degree of social cohesion a group achieves. These findings are discussed in the context of non-Western urban settings where religious leadership may represent both an alternative to social advancement and a crucial source of material aid, social support, and a strong sense of community.

"People may choose non-cooperation in social dilemmas either out of fear (if others choose to defect) or out of greed (when others choose to cooperate). Previous studies have shown that exogenous oxytocin motivates a 'tend and defend' pattern in inter-group conflict in which oxytocin stimulates in-group cooperation and out-group defense. Using a double-blind placebo-controlled design combined with a modified Prisoner's dilemma game (PDG), we examined the effect of oxytocin on social motivations in inter-individual conflict in men. Results showed that compared with the placebo group, oxytocin-exposed participants were less cooperative in general. Specifically, oxytocin amplified the effect of fear on defection but did not influence the effect of greed. Another non-social control study confirmed participants' decisions were sensitive to social factors. Our findings suggest that even when social group conflict is removed, oxytocin promotes distrust of strangers in 'me and you' inter-individual conflict by elevating social fear in men.

"Humans show a rare tendency to punish norm-violators who have not harmed them directly—a behavior known as third-party punishment. Research has found that third-party punishment is subject to intergroup bias, whereby people punish members of the out-group more severely than the in-group. Although the prevalence of this behavior is well-documented, the psychological processes underlying it remain largely unexplored. Some work suggests that it stems from people’s inherent predisposition to form alliances with in-group members and aggress against out-group members. This implies that people will show reflexive intergroup bias in third-party punishment, favoring in-group over out-group members especially when their capacity for deliberation is impaired. Here we test this hypothesis directly, examining whether intergroup bias in third-party punishment emerges from reflexive, as opposed to deliberative, components of moral cognition. In 3 experiments, utilizing a simulated economic game, we varied participants’ group relationship to a transgressor, measured or manipulated the extent to which they relied on reflexive or deliberative judgment, and observed people’s punishment decisions. Across group-membership manipulations (American football teams, nationalities, and baseball teams) and 2 assessments of reflexive judgment (response time and cognitive load), reflexive judgment heightened intergroup bias, suggesting that such bias in punishment is inherent to human moral cognition. We discuss the implications of these studies for theories of punishment, cooperation, social behavior, and legal practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Integrating information from existing research, qualitative ethnographic interviews, and participant observation, we designed a field experiment that introduces idiosyncratic environmental risk and a voluntary sharing decision into a standard public goods game. Conducted with subsistence resource users in rural villages on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Northeast Siberia, we find evidence consistent with a model of indirect reciprocity and local social norms of helping the needy. When participants are allowed to develop reputations in the experiments, as is the case in most small-scale societies, we find that sharing is increasingly directed toward individuals experiencing hardship, good reputations increase aid, and the pooling of resources through voluntary sharing becomes more effective. We also find high levels of voluntary sharing without a strong commitment device; however, this form of cooperation does not increase contributions to the public good. Our results are consistent with previous experiments and theoretical models, suggesting strategic risks tied to rewards, punishments, and reputations are important. However, unlike studies that focus solely on strategic risks, we find the effects of rewards, punishments, and reputations are altered by the presence of environmental factors. Unexpected changes in resource abundance increase interdependence and may alter the costs and benefits of cooperation, relative to defection. We suggest environmental factors that increase interdependence are critically important to consider when developing and testing theories of cooperation (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Social news, unlike video games or TV programs, conveys real-life interactions. Theoretically, social news in which people help or harm each other and violate rules should influence both prosocial and violation behaviors. In two experiments, we demonstrated the spreading effects of social news in a social interaction context emphasizing social conventions and a nonsocial interaction context emphasizing moral norms. Across the two studies, the results showed that positive social news increased cooperation (decreased defection) but had no effect on cheating, whereas negative social news increased cheating but with no change in cooperation (or defection).We conclude that there is a spreading impact of positive social news in the conventional norm domain and of negative social news in the moral norm domain.

Minor corrections of descriptive results, none of which alter the pattern of results and interpretations of the original publication, are also reported in the erratum.] Prosocial behavior is crucial for functioning societies. However, its reliable scientific assessment and the understanding of its underlying structure are still a challenge. We integrated 14 paradigms from diverse disciplines to identify reliable and method-independent subcomponents of human prosociality; 329 participants performed game theoretical paradigms and hypothetical distribution tasks commonly used in behavioral economics and completed interactive computer tasks and self-reports typically employed in psychology. Four subcomponents of prosociality were identified by exploratory factor analysis and verified by confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample: altruistically motivated prosocial behavior, norm motivated prosocial behavior, strategically motivated prosocial behavior, and self-reported prosocial behavior. Altruistically motivated behavior was related to gender, to enhanced cognitive skills, and to reduced negative affect. Our study provides a crucial step toward an overarching framework on prosocial behavior that will benefit future research on predictors, neural underpinnings, and plasticity of human cooperation and prosociality.

"Guilt and envy play an important role in social interaction. Guilt occurs when individuals cause harm to others or break social norms. Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the others’ advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participants’ experience of guilt and envy when engaging in social decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for the design of human-machine interaction systems that hope to achieve the kind of efficiency—cooperation, fairness, reciprocity, etc.—we see in human-human interaction.

"Cooperation among unrelated humans is frequently regarded as a defining feature in the evolutionary success of our species. Whereas, much research has addressed the strategic and cognitive mechanisms that underlie cooperation, investigations into chemosensory processes have received very limited research attention. To bridge that gap, we build on recent research that has identified the chemically synthesized odorant Hedione (HED) as a ligand for the putative human pheromone receptor (VN1R1) expressed in the olfactory mucosa, and hypothesize that exposure to HED may increase reciprocity. Applying behavioral economics paradigms, the present research shows that exposure to the ligand causes differentiated behavioral effects in reciprocal punishments (Study 1) as well as rewards (Study 2), two types of behaviors that are frequently regarded as essential for the development and maintenance of cooperation.

"We investigate whether cooperative behavior in social dilemmas is conditional on information about a partner's personality traits. Using a repeated one-shot continuous strategy Prisoner's Dilemma (two person Public Goods game), we test how information on personality traits of partners influences cooperative actions. Before each game we provide subjects with the rank-order of their partner (relative to all subjects in the session) on one of the personality traits of the Big Five Inventory. Using a within-subjects design we find that subjects are more cooperative when informed that their partner is more ‘Agreeable’ or ‘Open to Experience’. The primary reason for more cooperative behavior is the expectation that partners will give more to the public good. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Prior research on the participation in intergroup conflict suggests that prosocial individuals are parochial cooperators who escalate intergroup conflict. However, evidence on this conjecture is currently inconclusive. We provide a critical empirical test of the link between individuals’ prosocial tendencies (operationalized via Social Value Orientation [SVO] and trait Honesty-Humility) and cooperative behavior in different intergroup conflict games (i.e., variants of the Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma). Contradicting the view that prosocial individuals fuel intergroup conflict, both trait dimensions were positively associated with cooperative behavior toward others in general, irrespective of others’ group membership. That is, individuals with a prosocial SVO or high levels of Honesty-Humility, respectively, refrained from harming out-group members and, if possible, even benefited them. Overall, the results imply that the cooperativeness of prosocial individuals is universal in nature, thus exceeding the in-group boundary. Prosocial individuals are hence willing to foster intergroup cooperation rather than fueling intergroup conflict. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We conducted two experiments to explore how social decision making is influenced by the interaction of eye contact and social value orientation (SVO). Specifically, participants with a Prosocial (Prosocials) or a Proself (Proselfs) SVO played Prisoner Dilemma games with a computer partner following supraliminal (Experiment 1) and subliminal (Experiment 2) direct gaze from that partner. Results showed that participants made more cooperative decisions after supraliminal eye contact than no eye contact, and the effect only existed for the Prosocials but not for the Proselfs. Nevertheless, when the computer partner made a subliminal eye contact with the participants, although more cooperative choices were found among the Prosocials following subliminal eye contact, relative to no contact, the Proselfs demonstrated reduced cooperation rates. These findings suggest that Prosocials and Proselfs interpreted eye contact in distinct ways at different levels of awareness, which led to various social decision making.

"A proposed theory explains how actors rely on subtle features of social context when deciding whether to contribute resources to the group and punish their partners after they behave selfishly. The theory incorporates elements of identity control theory with social exchange theory. It proposes that features of social context shape the perceptions of actors in groups. These perceptions, in turn, affect their behaviors and the formation of social solidarity between group members. Three experiments test elements of the proposed theory by varying the context in which actors viewed themselves, their partners, and the overall goals of their groups. The instructions for study 1 told groups of actors that they either had cooperative or competitive personality types. Study 2 referred to the partners of actors as either collaborators or competitors. Study 3 told actors the goals of their groups were either defined by cooperation or competition. Each study assigned actors to the same group structure in which individuals completed a public goods game with opportunities to anonymously punish their partners. Results show that actors contributed more resources to their group, and spent fewer resources punishing their partners, when they viewed themselves or their partners as more cooperative than competitive. These behaviors, in turn, affected levels of trust, commitment, and cohesion that formed between group members. The context in which actors viewed the goals of their groups affected their contributions to these groups, but it did not significantly affect their punishment of partners. These patterns of behaviors also had negligible effects on social solidarity in groups. Thus, results from these experiments show that subtle features of the relational context (i.e. perceptions of self and partners) affect the means by which actors promote collective action in groups, shaping the formation of social solidarity between group members.

We assessed brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while the participants observed individuals with a good or bad reputation receiving or not receiving pain. The results indicated that the participants exhibited reduced empathic responses in AI and dACC to the individual who had a bad reputation relative to the one who had a good reputation, suggesting that their empathy for pain was modulated by the perceived reputation of others.

"The success or failure of human collective action often depends on the cooperation tendencies of individuals in groups, and on the information that individuals have about each other's cooperativeness. However, it is unclear whether these two factors have an interactive effect on cooperation dynamics. Using a decision-making experiment, we confirm that groups comprising individuals with higher cooperation tendencies cooperate at a higher level than groups comprising individuals with low cooperation tendencies. Moreover, assorting individuals with similar cooperation tendency together affected behaviour so that the most cooperative individuals tended to cooperate more and the least cooperative individuals cooperated less, compared to their behaviour in randomly formed groups. In line with predictions of evolutionary models of cooperation, there was a strong positive association between individuals' cooperation tendency and success when groups were formed assortatively, whereas such association did not exist when groups were formed randomly. Surprisingly, information about group members' cooperativeness in assorted groups had no effect on cooperation levels. We discuss potential explanations for why information about cooperativeness of others may be disregarded in certain circumstances. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We study the effects of voluntary participation on cooperation in collective action problems. Voluntary participation may foster cooperation through a mechanism of assortative selection of interaction partners based on false consensus bias, or through a mechanism whereby the decision to not participate can be used as a threat against free-riders. We examine the effectiveness of these mechanisms in a one-shot public goods experiment. Voluntary participation has a positive effect on provision only through the threat of nonparticipation. Assortative selection of interaction partners seems to play a minor role in our setting, whereas the threat of non-participation is a powerful force to discipline free-riding.

"Evolutionary psychologists have proposed two processes that could give rise to the pervasiveness of human cooperation observed among individuals who are not genetically related: reciprocity and conformity. We tested whether reciprocity outperformed conformity in promoting cooperation, especially when these psychological processes would promote a different cooperative or noncooperative response. To do so, across three studies, we observed participants’ cooperation with a partner after learning (a) that their partner had behaved cooperatively (or not) on several previous trials and (b) that their group members had behaved cooperatively (or not) on several previous trials with that same partner. Although we found that people both reciprocate and conform, reciprocity has a stronger influence on cooperation. Moreover, we found that conformity can be partly explained by a concern about one’s reputation—a finding that supports a reciprocity framework.

While the two dimensions are substitutes in the abstract computerized environment, they work in a complementary way to increase public goods contributions in the virtual world environment.

"This research explores the relevance of cooperation and students’ environmental disciplinary concentration on decision-making with respect to environmental issues—specifically the use of water, a limited common-pool resource. For this purpose, 61 environmental sciences students and 46 educational sciences students played the role of farmers and made decisions about irrigating their fields in the simulation ‘Irrigania.’ Prior to the simulation exercise, participants were randomly assigned to an experimental condition (competition or cooperation). Results demonstrated that both a cooperation situation and students’ environmental disciplinary concentration are related to the use of more pro-environmental and less selfish irrigation strategies in the simulation. Moreover, high levels of cooperation were able to counteract the lack of students’ disciplinary concentration on environmental problems; inversely, high levels of disciplinary concentration on environmental problems were able to counteract the competitive situations. This study highlights the relevance of programs that provide learning of (1) cooperative contexts that may reinforce cooperative frameworks on which students could base their behaviors, and (2) broader disciplinary concentration related to environmental problems that could lead to students feeling powerful in respect of knowing how to act against those problems and, thus, behaving in less selfish ways, with positive implications for the planet.

"Bounded generalized reciprocity (BGR) predicts that people cooperate to maintain a positive reputation with ingroup, but not outgroup, members—and this explains ingroup favoritism in cooperation. We propose that the benefits of maintaining a positive reputation are not limited by group boundaries and so people may cooperate to maintain a good reputation among outgroup members when they will meet and interact with members of that group again. According to this unbounded indirect reciprocity perspective, reputation can promote cooperation with both ingroup and outgroup members. Alternatively, social identity theory (SIT) favors social identity versus reputation as an explanation for cooperation among ingroup members. We test these hypotheses across five studies (Ns = 619, 607, 613, 360, and 615) that manipulate reputation, social identification, and partner's group membership in a cooperative decision making task. Across our studies, people were more cooperative with both ingroup and outgroup members when their reputation was at stake (Studies 1–5), and reputational concern mediated the effect of cues of gossip on cooperation in interactions with ingroup and outgroup members (Studies 1–4). Social identification did not affect cooperation with ingroup members. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the indirect benefits of cooperation that can transcend group boundaries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Non-monetary rewards are frequently used to promote pro-social behaviors, and these behaviors often result in approval from one’s peers. Nevertheless, we know little about how peer-approval, and particularly competition for peer-approval, influences people’s decisions to cooperate. This paper provides experimental evidence suggesting that people in peer-approval competitions value social approval more when it leads to unique and durable rewards. Our evidence suggests that such rewards act as a signaling mechanism, thereby contributing to the value of approval. We show that this signaling mechanism generates cooperation at least as effectively as cash rewards. Our findings point to the potential value of developing new mechanisms that rely on small non-monetary rewards to promote generosity in groups.

"Loss aversion, whereby losses weigh more heavily than equal-sized gains, has been demonstrated in many decision-making settings. Previous research has suggested reduced loss aversion in schizophrenia, but with little evidence of a link between loss aversion and schizophrenia illness severity. In this study, 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 16 control participants, matched by age and sex, played two versions of the Iterated Prisoners’ Dilemma, one version with only positive payoffs and another version in which negative payoffs were possible, with the second version being derived from the first by subtracting a constant value from all payoffs. The control group demonstrated significantly lower cooperation rates under negative payoffs, compared with the version with only positive payoffs, indicative of loss aversion. The patient group on average showed no loss aversion response. Moreover, the extent of loss aversion in patients was found to be negatively correlated with schizophrenia illness severity, with less ill patients showing loss aversion more similar to controls. Results were found to be robust to the inclusion of potential confounding factors as covariates within rigorous probit regression analyses. Reduced loss aversion is a feature of schizophrenia and related to illness severity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"How do outside options affect cooperation? We examine the stability of cooperation and the reasons for exit in public projects with stochastic outcomes, imperfect monitoring and an exit option. We find that treatments with high barriers to exit generate higher welfare overall as they foster stability and prevent inefficient separation of pairs. There is excessive exit in treatments with low barriers to exit, driven in part by an overestimate of the likelihood that the peer will leave and a desire not to be left alone in the public project. We contrast long-term 'strategic' and short-term 'egoistic' drivers of exit and find that short-term cost-benefit considerations play a more important role in treatments with lower barriers to exit.

"This project addresses how and why behavior in a resource dilemma differs when one only knows the choices of others versus only knows the state of the resource. Study 1 suggested that resource information is more valuable than social information, in that if the resource can be monitored, whether or not others’ choices can also be monitored has no impact on behavior. However, if the state of the resource is not known, the ability to know what others are doing is critical for cooperation. This seems to be because resource information encourages planning and long-term thinking, and social information encourages comparative thinking. Study 2 replicated the behavior pattern, revealed—surprisingly—that warnings that a resource is critically low undermine (rather than promote) cooperation, and that such responses depend on the availability of social and environmental information. Discussion focuses on how incomplete information about a resource might be addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Music as an environmental aspect of professional workplaces has been closely studied with respect to consumer behavior while sparse attention has been given to its relevance for employee behavior. In this article, we focus on the influence of music upon cooperative behavior within decision‐making groups. Based on results from two extended 20‐round public goods experiments, we find that happy music significantly and positively influences cooperative behavior. We also find a significant positive association between mood and cooperative behavior. Consequently, while our studies provide partial support for the relevance of affect in relation to cooperation within groups, we also show an independently important function of happy music that fits with a theory of synchronous and rhythmic activity as a social lubricant. More generally, our findings indicate that music and perhaps other atmospheric variables that are designed to prime consumer behavior might have comparably important effects for employees and consequently warrant closer investigation.

"We develop a model that relates self-control to cooperation patterns in social dilemmas, and we test the model in a laboratory public goods experiment. As predicted, we find a robust association between stronger self-control and higher levels of cooperation, and the association is at its strongest when the decision maker’s risk aversion is low and the cooperation levels of others high. We interpret the pattern as evidence for the notion that individuals may experience an impulse to act in self-interest—and that cooperative behavior benefits from self-control. Free-riders differ from other contributor types only in their tendency not to have identified a self-control conflict in the first place. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"There are many situations where an informed third-party agent communicates information about the value of a public good or group project to contributors. One example is the information provided by charity ratings organizations. I ask how information about the quality of a public good should be communicated in order to minimize free-riding. I propose that coarse or pooled messages about the quality of the public good can increase contributions and, in turn, social welfare. If individuals cannot distinguish between a public good that they would like to contribute to and a public good that would otherwise suffer from a high degree of free-riding, contributions to the latter may approach the efficient level of provision. Experimental results suggest that, in practice, some participants are averse to giving without having complete information and—as a result—coarse messages may decrease welfare.

"Humans live in groups where they cooperate so extensively that it is sometimes easy to forget that cooperative actions evolve only if they benefit the individual or cause the genes underlying the action to proliferate. Conflict, by contrast, is comparatively easy to understand, because different individuals can profit from the same resources. The advantage to group living in humans probably comes from protection against predation and attack, including by other groups of humans. Cooperation within groups can be called fraternal or egalitarian, with the former being between relatives and the latter between unrelated individuals. Both kinds of cooperation evolve only if genes underlying the actions proliferate as a result of the actions they cause. In this chapter we give an overview of cooperation and conflict in humans from an evolutionary perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The present research investigates how people use observed decision time to form expectations of others' behavior in social dilemmas. In four studies, participants received information about others' decision times (fast or slow) and were asked to estimate how much they contributed to a common pool. People believe fast decisions are more extreme than slow decisions; in other words, they assume that fast decisions are either extremely selfish or extremely cooperative. People also believe that fast deciders are less moral (Studies 1 and 2) and less conflicted (Study 2) than slow deciders. Beliefs about decision time depend on whether time can be attributed to self-paced reaction times or external time constraints. When decisions are made under external time constraints, time has inconsistent or heterogeneous effects on behavioral expectations (Study 2). Decision time also moderates the effects of other informational cues: Positive facial expressions and perceptions of trustworthiness have stronger effects on expectations when paired with fast decisions (Study 3). Finally, observed decision time also has behavioral consequences—people make more extreme decisions when interacting with a partner who decided quickly (Study 4). Observed decision time plays a crucial role in how expectations of others' behavior are formed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Although organizations use a variety of interventions to improve group functioning, getting people to work effectively with each other remains challenging. Because the presence of a dog has been shown to have positive effects on mood and dyadic interaction, we expected that the presence of a companion dog would also have positive effects on people in work groups. One reason for this is that a companion dog is likely to elevate positive emotions, which often promote prosocial behavior. In study 1 (n = 120) and study 2 (n = 120), participants were randomly assigned to either a dog-present or dog-absent four-person group. Three friendly companion dogs were randomly assigned to the dog-present groups; only one dog at a time was used during any given experimental session. In study 1, groups worked on an interactive problem-solving task; participants in the dog-present group displayed more verbal cohesion, physical intimacy, and cooperation. Study 2 was identical except that participants worked on a decision-making task requiring less interaction; participants in the dog-present condition displayed more verbal cohesion and physical intimacy and gave higher ratings of trustworthiness to fellow group members. In study 3, we examined behavioral indicators of positive emotions in dog-present and dog-absent groups. Naïve observers (n = 160) rated silent, 40-second video clips of interaction in groups where either a dog was (1) present but not visible or (2) not present. Behavior in dog-present groups was rated as more cooperative, comfortable, friendly, active, enthusiastic, and attentive.

"Although it is well established that rhythmically coordinating with a social partner can increase cooperation, it is as yet unclear when and why intentional coordination has such effects.We distinguish three dimensions along which explanations might vary. First, pro-social effects might require in-phase synchrony or simply coordination. Second, the effects of rhythmic movements on cooperation might be direct or mediated by an intervening variable. Third, the pro-social effects might occur in proportion to the quality of the coordination, or occur once some threshold amount of coordination has occurred. We report an experiment and two follow-ups which sought to identify which classes of models are required to account for the positive effects of coordinated rhythmic movement on cooperation. Across the studies, we found evidence (1) that coordination, and not just synchrony, can have pro-social consequences (so long as the social nature of the task is perceived), (2) that the effects of intentional coordination are direct, not mediated, and (3) that the degree of the coordination did not predict the degree of cooperation. The fact of inter-personal coordination (moving together in time and in a social context) is all that’s required for pro-social effects.We suggest that future research should use the kind of carefully controllable experimental task used here to continue to develop explanations for when and why coordination affects pro-social behaviors.

"To promote cooperation, people often rely on the administration of sanctions. However, from previous research we know that those in control of sanctions are generally reluctant to punish non-cooperative choice behavior and prefer to reward cooperative choice behavior, which is consistent with the do-no-harm principle. We propose that people are reluctant to punish because they feel personally responsible for the harm done. As such, we argue and demonstrate that the relative preference for rewarding over punishing is more pronounced when people decide individually than jointly (Experiment 1 and 2). Moreover, we show that the effect of grouping individuals on the reluctance to punish is mediated by feelings of personal responsibility (Experiment 3). These findings corroborate our reasoning that the feeling of personal responsibility has a self-restraining impact on the willingness to punish those who impair others’ interests, but not on the willingness to reward those who serve others’ interests.

"Many studies have looked at how individual player traits influence individual choice in the repeated prisoner's dilemma, but few studies have looked at how the average traits of pairs of players influence the average choices of pairs. We consider cognitive ability, patience, risk tolerance, and the Big Five personality measures as predictors of individual and average group choices in a 10-round repeated prisoner's dilemma. We find that a pair's average cognitive ability measured by Raven's cognitive ability test predicts average cooperation rates robustly and average earnings more modestly. Openness predicts both greater joint cooperation and the use of reciprocity to sustain cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We run several experiments which allow us to compare cooperation under perfect and imperfect information in a centralized and decentralized punishment regime. Under perfect and extremely noisy information, aggregate behavior does not differ between institutions. Under intermediate noise, punishment escalates in the decentralized peer-to-peer punishment regime which badly affects efficiency while sustaining cooperation for longer. Only decentralized punishment is often directed at cooperators (perverse punishment). We report several, sometimes subtle, differences in punishment behavior, and how contributions react.

"This study challenges researchers and practitioners in the field of leadership to consider communion as a relevant variable for (male) leadership effectiveness. We suggest that communal traits influence the ability of male leaders to engender cooperation and that this effect is stronger in male-dominated contexts. We argue that this is because relevant traits and leadership behaviors that underscore a sense of community are associated with stereotypically feminine roles and identity. In a series of three studies, experimental as well as survey-based, using Spanish, Dutch, and American samples, we examined such gendered construction of male leadership and its effects on cooperation. Among others, results are discussed in terms of how stereotypically masculine constructions of male leadership may create barriers to effective leadership.

"This study clarifies the types of motives that are important as a source of cooperation in a linear public goods experiment. Our experimental design separates contributions into those due to confusion, one-shot motives (which includes altruism, warm-glow, inequality aversion, and conditional cooperation), and multi-round motives (which includes a strategic motive under incomplete information, a failure of backward induction, and reciprocity). The experiment reveals that multi-round motives plays an important role in driving cooperative behavior. Confusion and one-shot motives play a minor role.

"This study examined whether the cultures of low- and high-power negotiators interact to influence cooperative behavior of low-power negotiators. Managers from 4 different cultural groups (Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States) negotiated face-to-face in a simulated power-asymmetric commons dilemma. Results supported an interaction effect in which cooperation of people with lower power was influenced by both their culture and the culture of the person with higher power. In particular, in a multicultural setting, low-power managers from Hong Kong, a vertical-collectivist culture emphasizing power differences and group alignment, adjusted their cooperation depending on the culture of the high-power manager with whom they interacted. This study contributes to understanding how culture shapes behavior of people with relatively low power, illustrates how a logic of appropriateness informs cooperation, and highlights the importance of studying multicultural social interactions in the context of negotiations, work teams, and global leadership.

"We study how communication affects cooperation in an experimental public goods environment with punishment and counter-punishment opportunities. Participants interacted over 30 rounds in fixed groups with fixed identifiers that allowed them to trace other group members’ behavior over time. The two dimensions of communication we study are asking for a specific contribution level and having to express oneself when choosing to counter-punish. We conduct four experimental treatments, all involving a contribution stage, a punishment stage, and a counter-punishment stage in each round. In the first treatment communication is not possible at any of the stages. The second treatment allows participants to ask for a contribution level at the punishment stage and in the third treatment participants are required to send a message if they decide to counter-punish. The fourth combines the two communication channels of the second and third treatments. We find that the three treatments involving communication at any of the two relevant stages lead to significantly higher contributions than the baseline treatment. We find no difference between the three treatments with communication. We also relate our results to previous results from treatments without counter-punishment opportunities and do not find that the presence of counter-punishment leads to lower cooperation level. The overall pattern of results shows that given fixed identifiers the key factor is the presence of communication. Whenever communication is possible contributions and earnings are higher than when it is not, regardless of counter-punishment opportunities.

"The impact of violent entertainment on viewer behavior remains disputed in the academic community. Although most studies focus on negative outcomes such as aggression, some studies also consider whether violent entertainment may reduce positive behaviors such as cooperation. The current article describes 2 studies of violent TV influences on cooperative behavior. The first study examined whether exposure to violent TV shows impacted cooperative behavior using the prisoner’s dilemma task in a sample of 181 mostly Hispanic young adults. Results indicated that exposure to violent TV had no impact on short-term cooperative behavior. Long-term exposure to violent TV in real life also did not predict the level of cooperative behavior. The second study examined how motivational factors influenced the relationship between violent TV and cooperative behavior. Overall, these results do not support traditional media effects models of violent entertainment, at least in regard to short-term influences in an experimental setting.

"Research on the evolution of cooperation in networked populations has assumed that ties are simply present or absent. Here we bring relational sociological insights about the strength of ties to bear on the problem of cooperation in dynamic networks. We argue that the value of ties affects their strength, which in turn promotes cooperation. We evaluate this argument with two studies. First, results from an agent-based model are consistent with the logic of our argument and are robust across a variety of initial conditions. Second, results from a controlled laboratory experiment with human participants support the key predictions. Across both studies we demonstrate that tie strength, operationalized as relationship duration, mediates the impact of tie value on cooperation.

"The provision of public goods motivates the creation of institutions designed to compel individuals to cooperate. Peer punishment mechanisms have garnered particular attention and suggest that groups are able to self-govern. Research suggests that the effectiveness of peer punishment depends on a group’s capacity to establish and enforce contribution norms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of such institutions when normative conflict makes contribution norms ambiguous. In an interior solution public good experiment, endowment heterogeneity and peer punishment are interacted. Results suggest that peer punishment induces greater contributions when endowments are homogeneous but does not increase contributions when endowments are heterogeneous. Across the payoff equivalent endowment conditions with the opportunity to punish, contributions and earnings are significantly lower when endowments are heterogeneous. This research suggests that the capacity of groups to self-govern is limited when normative conflict makes contribution norms ambiguous. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{The emergence of cooperation among unrelated human subjects is a
long-standing conundrum that has been amply studied both theoretically
and experimentally. Within the question, a less explored issue relates
to the gender dependence of cooperation, which can be traced back to
Darwin, who stated that ``women are less selfish but men are more
competitive{''}. Indeed, gender has been shown to be relevant in several
game theoretical paradigms of social cooperativeness, including
prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and ultimatum/dictator games, but there is
no consensus as to which gender is more cooperative. We here contribute
to this literature by analyzing the role of gender in a repeated
Prisoners' Dilemma played by Spanish high-school students in both a
square lattice and a heterogeneous network. While the experiment was
conducted to shed light on the influence of networks on the emergence of
cooperation, we benefit from the availability of a large dataset of more
1200 participants. We applied different standard econometric techniques
to this dataset, including Ordinary Least Squares and Linear Probability
models including random effects. All our analyses indicate that being
male is negatively associated with the level of cooperation, this
association being statistically significant at standard levels. We also
obtain a gender difference in the level of cooperation when we control
for the unobserved heterogeneity of individuals, which indicates that
the gender gap in cooperation favoring female students is present after
netting out this effect from other socio-demographics factors not
controlled for in the experiment, and from gender differences in risk,
social and competitive preferences.}"
"{We analyze one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma decisions made by participants of
the high-stakes TV game show The Manipulation, and document the
influence of social life factors on economic decisions, alongside the
participants' rational considerations. In particular, we employ a social
psychology approach to provide a new perspective on the determinants of
financial assistance. Our insights from the TV game are corroborated by
a controlled laboratory experiment. We find that helping and sharing
behavior in strategic situations is explained by Attribution Theory (AT)
and beliefs about expected cooperativeness. Specifically, participants'
decisions are influenced by perceived controllability of opponents'
conditions (an attributional characteristic influencing perception of
responsibility and related emotions) and social-relations-based beliefs
regarding the opponents' expected cooperativeness. (C) 2013 Elsevier

"{During conversation, interlocutors coordinate their behavior on many
levels. Two distinct forms of behavioral coordination have been
empirically linked with affiliation and cooperation during or following
face-to-face interaction: behavior matching and interpersonal synchrony.
Only the latter form constitutes behavioral entrainment involving a
coupling between independent oscillators. We present the first study of
the association between spontaneously occurring behavioral coordination
and post-interaction economic game play. Triads of same-sexed strangers
conversed for 10 min, after which each participant played an unannounced
one-shot prisoner's dilemma (PD) toward each co-participant. When dyads
had higher language style matching scores (LSM: Gonzales, A.L., Hancock,
J.T., \& Pennebaker, J.W. (2010). Language style matching as a predictor
of social dynamics in small groups. Communication Research, 31, 3-19),
the individuals evaluated each other more positively, but they were no
more likely to cooperate in the PD. However, when dyads' speech rates
(mean syllable duration) converged more strongly from the beginning to
the end of the conversation, they were more likely to cooperate in the
PD, despite no effect on interpersonal evaluations. Speech rate
convergence, a form of rhythmic entrainment, could benefit interlocutors
by mutually reducing cognitive processing during interaction. We suggest
that spontaneous, temporally based behavioral coordination might
facilitate prosocial behavior when the joint cooperative effort is
itself perceived as a form of coordination. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

"{In this study, we investigated the role of facial cues in cooperator and
defector recognition. First, a face image database was constructed from
pairs of full face portraits of target subjects taken at the moment of
decision-making in a prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) and in a preceding
neutral task. Image pairs with no deficiencies (n=67) were standardized
for orientation and luminance. Then, confidence in defector and
cooperator recognition was tested with image rating in a different group
of lay judges (n=62). Results indicate that (1) defectors were better
recognized (58\% vs. 47\%), (2) they looked different from cooperators
(p<.01), (3) males but not females evaluated the images with a relative
bias towards the cooperator category (p<.01), and (4) females were more
confident in detecting defectors (p<.05). According to facial
microexpression analysis, defection was strongly linked with depressed
lower lips and less opened eyes. Significant correlation was found
between the intensity of micromimics and the rating of images in the
cooperator-defector dimension. In summary, facial expressions can be
considered as reliable indicators of momentary social dispositions in
the PDG. Females may exhibit an evolutionary-based overestimation bias
to detecting social visual cues of the defector face.}"
"{We study the individual behavior of students and workers in an

opportunities. Students cooperate more than workers. Cooperation
increases in both subject pools when a personal punishment option is
available. Students are less likely than workers to adopt strategies of
unconditional defection, and more likely to select strategies of
conditional cooperation. Finally, students are more likely than workers
to sanction uncooperative behavior by adopting decentralized punishment,
and also personal punishment when available. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

"{Relying on the framework provided by Schwartz's theory of personal
values, we investigated whether values can help explain prosocial
behaviour. We first distinguished value-expressive behaviours from
value-ambivalent behaviours. The former are compatible with primarily
one value or with congruent values, the latter with mutually conflicting
values. In Study 1, an analysis over all 41 (39 unpublished) samples in
which we measured personal values and prosocial behaviour in monetarily
incentivized strategic interactions (N = 1289; data collected between
2007 and 2010 in China, Finland, Germany, Israel, and the West Bank)
supported our idea that personal values, universalism in particular,
predict value-expressive (prisoner's dilemma cooperation and trust game
back-transfers) but not value-ambivalent behaviours (trust game
transfers and ultimatum game proposals and responses). Study 2 (N=56)
focused on dictator game behaviours, which we expected and found to be
strongly value-expressive. The findings contribute to the ongoing
discussion on whether and under which circumstances values shape
behaviour. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}"
"{Background: Deficits in pro-social cooperation are common in many
individuals with mental illnesses such as depression. For decades,
researchers have used economic game paradigms to compare cross-cultural
cooperative behavior. However, research using economic games to assess
cooperative behavior in clinical populations is in the early stages. We
hypothesized that individuals with greater depressive symptoms would
struggle to maintain reciprocity in iterative games, but not in
single-iteration games measuring personal values.
Methods: Participants (n=41) played four computer-based economic games
(prisoner's dilemma, the public goods game, the ultimatum game, and the
trust game) measuring different aspects of cooperation. Participants
completed the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and other
measures of personality and demographics. Analyses assessed the
relationships between game performance and psychological distress as
measured by the DASS.
Results: Significant correlations were found between game performance
and depressive symptoms, but not symptoms of anxiety or stress.
Performance in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game was
significantly related to depression in a linear regression even when
known associations with depressive affect such as age, gender, race,
education, marital status, and neuroticism were controlled for
Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were associated with an inability to
sustain reciprocal cooperation. Participants showed the predicted
deficits in cooperation in these economic games. Economic games show the
potential for assessing the social deficits associated with depressive
symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Five studies develop and validate the Self- and Other-Interest
Inventory, an individual-difference measure of the motivation to act in
one's own interest and the motivation to act in another's interest that
measures these motivations at the level of self-beliefs. Study 1
demonstrates that self- and other-interest can be measured reliably and
validly, as independent constructs, with a self- report measure. Study 2
develops a version of the Self- and Other-Interest Inventory for use
with a general population and demonstrates systematic changes in the
relation between self- and other-interest scores with age. Study 3 shows
that self- and other-interest scores vary independently, as a function
of the accessibility of related values. Study 4 provides evidence that
self- interest scores predict behaviors that benefit the self and that
other-interest scores predict behaviors that benefit another person.
Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that in situations that involve a
trade-off between the pursuit of self- interest and the pursuit of
other-interest, such as the prisoner's dilemma, self- and other-interest
scores contribute independently to behavioral prediction.}"
"{Do the parties in a typical dispute face incentives similar to those in
the classic prisoner's dilemma game? In this article, we explore whether
the costs and benefits of legal representation are such that each party
seeks legal representation in the hope of exploiting the other party,
while knowing full well that failing to do so will open up the
possibility of being exploited. The article first shows how it is
possible to test for the presence of such an incentive structure in a
typical dispute resolution system. It then reports estimates of the
incentives for the parties to obtain legal representation in wage
disputes that were settled by final-offer arbitration in New Jersey. The
article also reports briefly on similar studies of data from discharge
grievances, court-annexed disputes in Pittsburgh, and child custody
disputes in California. In each case, the data provide evidence that the
parties face strong individual incentives to obtain legal representation
that make the parties jointly worse off. Using our New Jersey data, we
find that expert agents may well have played a productive role in
moderating the biases of their clients, but only early on in the history
of the system. Over time, the parties slowly evolved to a noncooperative
equilibrium where the use of lawyers becomes nearly universal, despite
the fact that agreeing not to hire lawyers is cheaper and does not
appear to alter arbitration outcomes.}"
"{In two studies using variations of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, we
explore the impact of individual traits and social context on aggressive
behavior. In the first study, we compared defection rates in the
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma when participants were presented with a
payoff matrix (Description condition) or learned payoffs through
experience (Experience condition). Interpersonal trust and maximizing
tendency led to relatively less defection in the Description condition
than in the Experience condition, demonstrating that individual
characteristics manifest differently depending on the information
available to decision-makers. In the second study, we employed a new
game paradigm, the Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma with Intragroup Power
Dynamics, to examine the way that power motives influence extreme
aggressive behavior. We discovered that certain individuals exhibit very
high levels of defection, but only when they play with particular
combinations of predefined strategies, further suggesting how the
confluence of individual factors and context can induce aggression. (C)

"{We report insights into the behavior of prisoners in dilemma situations
that so famously carry their name. We compare female inmates and
students in a simultaneous and a sequential Prisoner's Dilemma. In the
simultaneous Prisoner's Dilemma, the cooperation rate among inmates
exceeds the rate of cooperating students. Relative to the simultaneous
dilemma, cooperation among first-movers in the sequential Prisoner's
Dilemma increases for students, but not for inmates. Students and
inmates behave identically as second movers. Hence, we find a similar
and significant fraction of inmates and students to hold social
preferences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Despite the prevalence of studies examining economic decision-making as
a purely rational phenomenon, common sense suggests that emotions affect
our decision-making particularly in a social context. To explore the
influence of emotions on economic decision-making, we manipulated
opponent-directed emotions prior to engaging participants in two social
exchange decision-making games (the Trust Game and the Prisoner's
Dilemma). Participants played both games with three different
(fictional) partners and their tendency to defect was measured. Prior to
playing each game, participants exchanged handwritten ``essays{''} with
their partners, and subsequently exchanged evaluations of each essay.
The essays and evaluations, read by the participant, were designed to
induce either anger, sympathy, or a neutral emotional response toward
the confederate with whom they would then play the social exchange
games. Galvanic skin conductance level (SCL) showed enhanced
physiological arousal during anger induction compared to both the
neutral and sympathy conditions. In both social exchange games,
participants were most likely to defect against their partner after
anger induction and least likely to defect after sympathy induction,
with the neutral condition eliciting intermediate defection rates. This
pattern was found to be strongest in participants exhibiting low
cognitive control (as measured by a Go/no-Go task). The findings
indicate that emotions felt toward another individual alter how one
chooses to interact with them, and that this influence depends both on
the specific emotion induced and the cognitive control of the
individual.}"
"{Evolutionary theory predicts that observable traits should evolve to
reliably indicate unobservable behavioral tendencies in coordination
games but not social dilemmas. We conducted a two-part study to test
this idea. First, we recorded 60-s videos of participants, and then
these participants played a stag hunt game or a prisoner's dilemma.
Subsequently, raters viewed these videos, with the sound either off or
on, and they guessed player choices. Raters showed a significant
tendency to guess that attractive players chose stag. In contrast to the
prediction, rater accuracy was at chance regardless of whether the sound
of the video was off or on. For prisoner's dilemma players, raters
showed a significant tendency to guess that women cooperated at a higher
rate than men. Again in contrast to the prediction, accuracy was
significantly above chance in this case. To calibrate the importance of
this accuracy rate, we developed two models that suggest the accuracy we
observed in the prisoner's dilemma case is probably not high enough to
support the evolution of cooperation. Altogether, our results show that
raters tried to achieve a meaningful degree of accuracy about players by
using the limited information available in the videos, but they could
not do so. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Previous research has discovered a curious phenomenon: groups cooperate
less than individuals in a deterministic prisoner's dilemma game, but
cooperate more than individuals when uncertainty is introduced into the
game. We conducted two studies to examine three possible processes that
might drive groups to be more cooperative than individuals in reducing
risks: group risk concern, group cooperation expectation, and pressure
to conform to social norms. We found that ex post guilt aversion and
ex-post blame avoidance cause group members to be more risk concerned
than individuals under uncertainty. These concerns drive groups to
choose the cooperation (and risk-reduction) strategy more frequently
than individuals. Groups also have higher cooperation expectations for
their corresponding groups than individuals have for their corresponding
individuals. We found no evidence of pressure to conform to social norms
driving groups to be more cooperative than individuals.}"
"{The neural mechanisms underlying decision-making to cooperate or defect
were investigated using event-related potentials during an iterated
computer Prisoner's Dilemma task, adapted to induce working memory
operation. Event-related potentials from 64 leads of 22 participants
were recorded during 90 trials and averaged depending on the condition
of cooperation and defect. The P200 component of the event-related
potentials provided evidence for activation differences between
cooperation and defect. Cooperation elicited significantly increased
P200 activation at parieto-occipital leads, while defect activated
primarily the prefrontal electrodes. Functional mapping using Low
Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography indicated that in the 150-180 ms
time window Brodmann areas 19 (precuneus) and 17 (lingual gyrus),
exhibited increased activation during cooperation, while Brodmann area 6
(precentral gyrus) exhibited increased activation when participants
defected. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that
cooperation and defect elicit different brain activation at specific
loci and within specific time windows.}"
"{It is commonly assumed that identification with a social group is
constant throughout the play of a one-shot game in the absence of
feedback. Our experiment provides evidence that challenges this
assumption. Subjects play one of two versions of the prisoner's dilemma
game. These versions are distinguished by the relative attractiveness of
the uncooperative action. The version with a relatively attractive
uncooperative action is referred to as the Easy Game and the other as
the Difficult Game. Subjects who play the Difficult Game, exhibit a
change in group identification which is related to their selected
action. No such relationship exists within the Easy Game. Additionally,
the change primarily occurs after the action is selected rather than
upon inspection of the game. (c) 2012 Western Social Science

"{In a recent article in this journal entitled ``Game Theory and Climate
Diplomacy{''}, DeCanio and Fremstad (2013) provide an interesting
treatment of a range of simple game theoretic characterizations of
international climate negotiations. The authors use the Nash and
Maxi-min stability definitions to analyze 25 two-by-two ordinal games,
which they recognize as ``possible game-theoretic characterizations of
climate negotiations between two players (e.g., Great Powers or
coalitions of states){''}. The authors' main conclusion that the
Prisoner's Dilemma might not be the best description of climate
negotiations game is consistent with the findings of others who have
studied two-by-two conflicts over natural commons (Bardhan, 1993;
Madani, 2010; Sandler, 1992; Taylor, 1987). Nevertheless, given the
importance of the climate change issue, as well as the potential effects
of our actions on the state of the environment and the well-being of
future generations, I would like to address some gaps in their analysis,
which result in it having limited usefulness for policy purposes. Of
course, all models are simplified representations of reality, full of
limitations. ``Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are
useful{''} (Box and Draper, 1987). So, ``the practical question is how
wrong do they have to be to not be useful{''} (Box and Draper, 1987).
Models' limitations need to be carefully considered when interpreting
them or applying their results to policy but some models are too simple
to provide useful policy advice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"{We measure the other-regarding behavior in samples from three related
populations in the upper Midwest of the United States: college students,
non-student adults from the community surrounding the college, and adult
trainee truckers in a residential training program. The use of typical
experimental economics recruitment procedures made the first two groups
substantially self-selected. Because the context reduced the opportunity
cost of participating dramatically, 91 \% of the adult trainees
solicited participated, leaving little scope for self-selection in this
sample. We find no differences in the elicited other-regarding
preferences between the self-selected adults and the adult trainees,
suggesting that selection is unlikely to bias inferences about the
prevalence of other-regarding preferences among non-student adult
subjects. Our data also reject the more specific hypothesis that
approval-seeking subjects are the ones most likely to select into
experiments. Finally, we observe a large difference between
self-selected college students and self-selected adults: the students
appear considerably less pro-social.}"
"{Previous research has demonstrated that chronically accessible
self-knowledge impacts how corresponding traits are perceived in oneself

their chronic traits, we know less about the accuracy of these
judgments. In the current work, we explored whether chronicity results
in greater accuracy in interpersonal sensitivity. Using a response time
measure of attribute chronicity, we found that individuals for whom
trustworthiness was a chronic trait were better able to distinguish
cheaters from cooperators in a real life prisoner's dilemma game.

"{Recent evidence suggests that psychopathy is a trait continuum. This has
unappreciated implications for understanding the selective advantage of
psychopathic traits. Although clinical psychopathy is typically
construed as a strategy of unconditional defection, subclinical
psychopathy may promote strategic conditional defection, broadening the
adaptive niche of psychopathy within human societies. To test this, we
focus on a ubiquitous real-life source of conditional behaviour: the
expected relational value of social partners, both in terms of their
quality and the likely quantity of future interactions with them. We
allow for conversational interaction among participants prior to their
playing an unannounced, one-shot prisoner's dilemma game, which fosters
naturalistic interpersonal evaluation and conditional behaviour, while
controlling punishment and reputation effects. Individuals scoring
higher on factor 1 (callous affect, interpersonal manipulation) of the
Levenson self-report psychopathy scale defected conditionally on two
kinds of low-value partners: those who interrupted them more during the
conversation, and those with whom they failed to discover cues to future
interaction. Both interaction effects support the hypothesis that
subclinical primary psychopathy potentiates defection on those with low
expected relational value. These data clarify the function and form of
psychopathic traits, while highlighting adaptive variation in human
social strategies.}"
"{We observed the behaviors of the same people across five games - two
prisoner's dilemma games, a trust game (in which the subject took on the
role of both truster and trustee), a dictator game, and a faith game -
any pair of which was separated by an interval of several months to
reduce potential carry-over effects, and found strong consistency in
behaviors among these games. We also found consistency between the
expectations of other players' behaviors and the player's own behavior
across games. We further found that the consistent behavioral
pro-sociality observed across different games was related to the general
measures of pro-social value orientation and perceiving the game
situations. These findings suggest that individual and cultural
differences in game behaviors can reflect both the ways in which people
perceive game situations and their general social preferences. (C) 2012

"{Does the cue of money lead to selfish, greedy, exploitative behaviors or
to fairness, exchange, and reciprocity? We found evidence for both,
suggesting that people have both sets of meaningful associations, which
can be differentially activated by exposure to clean versus dirty money.
In a field experiment at a farmers' market, vendors who handled dirty
money subsequently cheated customers, whereas those who handled clean
money gave fair value (Experiment 1). In laboratory studies with
economic games, participants who had previously handled and counted
dirty money tended toward selfish, unfair practices unlike those who had
counted clean money or dirty paper, both of which led to fairness and
reciprocity. These patterns were found with the trust game (Experiment
2), the prisoner's dilemma (Experiment 4), the ultimatum game
(Experiment 5), and the dictator game (Experiment 6). Cognitive measures
indicated that exposure to dirty money lowered moral standards
(Experiment 3) and reduced positive attitudes toward fairness and
reciprocity (Experiments 6-7), whereas exposure to clean money had the
opposite effects. Thus, people apparently have 2 contradictory sets of
associations (including behavioral tendencies) to money, which is a
complex, powerful, and ubiquitous aspect of human social life and
cultural organization.}"
"{People readily ascribe personality traits to others and believe that
faces hold important guides to character. Here we examined the
relationship between static facial appearance and self-reported
cooperation/defection using the prisoner's dilemma (N = 193). Study 1
combined face images of those self-reporting they would be most and
least likely to cooperate. The composites of cooperators were seen as
more cooperative than non-cooperators. Study 2 demonstrated accuracy
with ratings of individual faces. Masculinity of face shape was
negatively related to self-reported cooperation for men, but not women.
Further, ratings of smile intensity were positively, but not
significantly, related to self-reported cooperation. Overall,
individuals appear able judge the potential of others to cooperate from
static facial appearance alone at rates greater than chance. (C) 2012

"{Dozens of studies show that bystanders are less likely to help victims
as bystander number increases. However, these studies model one
particular situation, in which victims need only one helper. Using a
multi-player dictator game, we study a different but common situation,
in which a recipient's welfare increases with the amount of help, and
donors can share the burden of helping. We find that dictators transfer
less when there are more dictators, and recipients earn less when there
are multiple dictators. This effect persisted despite mechanisms
eliminating uncertainty about other dictators' behavior (a strategy
method and communication). In a typical public goods game, people seem
to transform the situation into an assurance game, willing to contribute
if certain others will too. Despite similarities, people do not treat a
recipient's welfare like a public good. Instead, people seem to
transform the situation into a prisoner's dilemma, refusing to help
whatever others do. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"

multiple actions, in which we manipulate players' beliefs and show that
group identity has a consistent positive effect on cooperation only when
there is common knowledge of group affiliation. We also test the

flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma as a simulated interaction with a
friend with 27 individuals with the generalized type of social anxiety
disorder and 23 demographically equivalent individuals without the
disorder. Participants with generalized social anxiety disorder were
less giving on the task. Lower giving was also moderately associated
with interpersonal variables (e.g., coldness). A trend was also found
for participants with generalized social anxiety disorder to show lower
assertiveness on the task. The connection between generalized social
anxiety disorder and friendship impairment appears likely to be
partially explained by interpersonal constraint that is perceived by
others as coldness and manifests in a behavioral economics task.}"
"{Objective Humans face an enduring conflict between desires to affiliate
with others but to protect the self; effective social functioning often
requires reconciling the resulting ambivalence between these motives.
Attachment anxiety is characterized by chronically heightened concerns
about affiliation and self-protection; we investigated how anxious
individuals chronic relational ambivalence affects interpersonal
behavior. Method We used the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Assurance Game
to examine how the ambivalence associated with attachment anxiety
affects pro-social behavior, comparing chronic attachment anxiety with
both chronic (Study 1; N?=?94) and contextually activated (Study 2;
N?=?56) security. Results Chronic attachment anxiety was associated with
ambivalent behavior in the social dilemma games. Specifically, the
chronically anxious were mistrustfully inconsistent in their strategic
choices and took more time to make these choices. However, priming the
chronically anxious with attachment security decreased ambivalence by
promoting more fluent cooperative behavior. Conclusions To our
knowledge, these are the first studies to examine the effect of the
anxiously attached's chronic relational ambivalence on pro-social
behavior. These findings illustrate that the simultaneous activation of
affiliation and self-protection can have interpersonal consequences,
increasing mistrust and hesitance. Importantly, however, we were able to
attenuate these effects by priming felt security.}"
"{Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of altruistic
behavior in intergroup conflict in humans frequently make use of the
assumption that warfare can be modeled as a symmetrical n-person
prisoner's dilemma, abstracting away the strategic differences between
attack and defense. In contrast, some empirical studies on intergroup
conflict in hunter-gatherer societies and chimpanzees indicate that
fitness relevant risks and potential benefits of attacks and defenses
might have differed substantially under ancestral conditions. Drawing on
these studies, it is hypothesized that the success of defenses was much
more important for individual and kin survival and that a disposition to
act altruistically during intergroup conflict is thus more likely to
evolve for the strategic situation of defense. It is then investigated
empirically if such asymmetries in the occurrence of altruistic behavior
during intergroup conflict can be found. Analyzing detailed historical
case data from 20th century wars, this study finds that altruistic
behavior towards members of the in-group indeed seems to occur more
frequently when soldiers are defending themselves and their comrades
against enemy attacks. It is proposed that this asymmetry reflects
adaptive behavioral responses to the materially different strategic
character of attacks and defenses under ancestral conditions. If true,
this would call for a refinement of theories of the evolutionary
interaction of intergroup conflict and altruism.}"
"{In the present study we investigated the mechanism inherent in the
decision-making process in a single-trial with the game called
Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), in which players might simultaneously encounter
different conditions that influence cooperation: namely, reciprocity,
perceived control, and risk taking. We conducted 2 experiments to
examine how, and to what extent, these conditions contribute to
cooperation. By incorporating direct measurements of the potential
conditions into a paradigm produced in previous studies, we were able to
test the reliability of backward inference and to quantify the effect
exerted by each condition. Results consistently revealed a complex
cognitive process in single-trial PD: each condition had an influence on
decision making, but none of them showed a dominating power to prompt
cooperation independently; reciprocity served as a moderator.}"
"{Altruistic behavior has been defined in economic terms as ``. costly
acts that confer economic benefits on other individuals{''}(Fehr \&
Fischbacher, 2003). In a prisoner's dilemma game, cooperation benefits
the group but is costly to the individual (relative to defection), yet a
significant number of players choose to cooperate. We propose that
people do value rewards to others, albeit at a discounted rate (social
discounting), in a manner similar to discounting of delayed rewards
(delay discounting). Two experiments opposed the personal benefit from
defection to the socially discounted benefit to others from cooperation.
The benefit to others was determined from a social discount function
relating the individual's subjective value of a reward to another person
and the social distance between that individual and the other person. In
Experiment 1, the cost of cooperating was held constant while its social
benefit was varied in terms of the number of other players, each gaining
a fixed, hypothetical amount of money. In Experiment 2, the cost of
cooperating was again held constant while the social benefit of
cooperating was varied by the hypothetical amount of money earned by a
single other player. In both experiments, significantly more
participants cooperated when the social benefit was higher.}"
"{The social brain hypothesis states that selection pressures associated
with complex social relationships have driven the evolution of
sophisticated cognitive processes in primates. We investigated how the
size of cooperative primate communities depends on the memory of each of
its members and on the pressure exerted by natural selection. To this
end we devised an evolutionary game theoretical model in which social
interactions are modelled in terms of a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma
played by individuals who may exhibit a different memory capacity. Here,
memory is greatly simplified and mapped onto a single parameter m
describing the number of conspecifics whose previous action each
individual can remember. We show that increasing m enables cooperation
to emerge and be maintained in groups of increasing sizes. Furthermore,
harsher social dilemmas lead to the need for a higher m in order to
ensure high levels of cooperation. Finally, we show how the interplay
between the dilemma individuals face and their memory capacity m allows
us to define a critical group size below which cooperation may thrive,
and how this value depends sensitively on the strength of natural
selection. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

"{Cross-culturally, participants in public goods games reward participants
and punish defectors to a degree beyond that warranted by rational,
profit-maximizing considerations. Costly punishment, where individuals
impose costs on defectors at a cost to themselves, is thought to promote
the maintenance of cooperation. However, despite substantial variation
in the extent to which people punish, little is known about why some
individuals, and not others, choose to pay these costs. Here, we test
whether personality traits might contribute to variation in helping and
punishment behavior. We first replicate a previous study using public
goods scenarios to investigate effects of sex, relatedness and
likelihood of future interaction on willingness to help a group member
or to punish a transgressor. As in the previous study, we find that
individuals are more willing to help related than unrelated needy others
and that women are more likely to express desire to help than men.
Desire to help was higher if the probability of future interaction is
high, at least among women. In contrast, among these variables, only
participant sex predicted some measures of punitive sentiment. Extending
the replication, we found that punitive sentiment, but not willingness
to help, was predicted by personality traits. Most notably, participants
scoring lower on Agreeableness expressed more anger towards and greater
desire to punish a transgressor, and were more willing to engage in
costly punishment, at least in our scenario. Our results suggest that
some personality traits may contribute to underpinning individual
variation in social enforcement of cooperation.}"
"{The strong reciprocity model of the evolution of human cooperation has
gained some acceptance, partly on the basis of support from experimental
findings. The observation that unfair offers in the ultimatum game are
frequently rejected constitutes an important piece of the experimental
evidence for strong reciprocity. In the present study, we have
challenged the idea that the rejection response in the ultimatum game
provides evidence of the assumption held by strong reciprocity theorists
that negative reciprocity observed in the ultimatum game is inseparably
related to positive reciprocity as the two sides of a preference for
fairness. The prediction of an inseparable relationship between positive
and negative reciprocity was rejected on the basis of the results of a
series of experiments that we conducted using the ultimatum game, the
dictator game, the trust game, and the prisoner's dilemma game. We did
not find any correlation between the participants' tendencies to reject
unfair offers in the ultimatum game and their tendencies to exhibit
various prosocial behaviors in the other games, including their
inclinations to positively reciprocate in the trust game. The
participants' responses to postexperimental questions add support to the
view that the rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game is a
tacit strategy for avoiding the imposition of an inferior status.}"
"{The presence of costly cooperation between otherwise selfish actors is
not trivial. A prominent mechanism that promotes cooperation is spatial
population structure. However, recent experiments with human subjects
report substantially lower level of cooperation then predicted by
theoretical models. We analyze the data of such an experiment in which a
total of 400 players play a Prisoner's Dilemma on a 4 x 4 square lattice
in two treatments, either interacting via a fixed square lattice (15
independent groups) or with a population structure changing after each
interaction (10 independent groups). We analyze the statistics of
individual decisions and infer in which way they can be matched with the
typical models of evolutionary game theorists. We find no difference in
the strategy updating between the two treatments. However, the strategy
updates are distinct from the most popular models which lead to the
promotion of cooperation as shown by computer simulations of the
strategy updating. This suggests that the promotion of cooperation by
population structure is not as straightforward in humans as often
envisioned in theoretical models.}"
"{Reputation plays a central role in human societies. Empirical and
theoretical work indicates that a good reputation is valuable in that it
increases one's expected payoff in the future. Here, we explore a game
that couples a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), in which participants
can earn and can benefit from a good reputation, with a market in which
reputation can be bought and sold. This game allows us to investigate
how the trading of reputation affects cooperation in the PD, and how
participants assess the value of having a good reputation. We find that
depending on how the game is set up, trading can have a positive or a
negative effect on the overall frequency of cooperation. Moreover, we
show that the more valuable a good reputation is in the PD, the higher
the price at which it is traded in the market. Our findings have
important implications for the use of reputation systems in practice.}"
"{As actors participate in the production of public goods, processes of
social comparison may affect the decisions about the individual
contributions as well as the endogenously changing structure of an
underlying social network. This leads to the transformation of an
ordinary n-player Prisoner's Dilemma of collective action into an
n-player coordination game. The paper uses agent-based simulations to
trace the formation of public goods while varying network
characteristics, such as density, segregation, or the strength of
relationships. Additionally, the usage of both a forward- and a
backward-looking agent model shows possible implications of different
assumptions about the actors' decision making. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"{The natural tendency for humans to make and break relationships is
thought to facilitate the emergence of cooperation. In particular,
allowing conditional cooperators to choose with whom they interact is
believed to reinforce the rewards accruing to mutual cooperation while
simultaneously excluding defectors. Here we report on a series of human
subjects experiments in which groups of 24 participants played an
iterated prisoner's dilemma game where, critically, they were also
allowed to propose and delete links to players of their own choosing at
some variable rate. Over a wide variety of parameter settings and
initial conditions, we found that dynamic partner updating significantly
increased the level of cooperation, the average payoffs to players, and
the assortativity between cooperators. Even relatively slow update rates
were sufficient to produce large effects, while subsequent increases to
the update rate had progressively smaller, but still positive, effects.
For standard prisoner's dilemma payoffs, we also found that
assortativity resulted predominantly from cooperators avoiding
defectors, not by severing ties with defecting partners, and that
cooperation correspondingly suffered. Finally, by modifying the payoffs
to satisfy two novel conditions, we found that cooperators did punish
defectors by severing ties, leading to higher levels of cooperation that
persisted for longer.}"
"{It has been argued that conscious processes have only a limited causal
influence over social behavior. In contrast to this view, the current
manuscript provides evidence that explicit person memories serve an
important social function. Specifically, they support the strategy of
indirect reciprocity, in which help is directed toward those with a
helpful reputation and away from those with a non-helpful reputation.
Three studies using the prisoner's dilemma paradigm provided evidence
that participants can only execute the strategy of indirect reciprocity
when they possess explicit memory for an interaction partner's prior
behaviors. This occurred under a substantial memory load, and a
levels-of-processing manipulation provided evidence for the causal role
of explicit memory in indirect reciprocity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

"{We investigate the welfare implications of unfair incentive contracts in
comparison with interactions without contracts. Reciprocal people should
cooperate conditionally in the latter situation but punish unfairness by
non-cooperation. We confirm that some people do cooperate conditionally
in a sequential prisoner's dilemma. Furthermore, some subjects do not
cooperate if they face an unfair incentive contract in a similar
context. However, there is no correlation between these two types of
reciprocity. At an aggregate level, all contracts - no matter how fair
they are - improve welfare even if agents are conditionally cooperative.

"{Humans often make seemingly irrational choices in situations of conflict
between a particular smaller-sooner reinforcer and a more abstract,
temporally extended, but larger reinforcer. In two experiments, the
extent to which the availability of commitment responses-self-imposed
restrictions on future choices-might improve self-control in such
situations was investigated. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma
game against a computer that played a tit-for-tat strategy-cooperating
after a participant cooperated, defecting after a participant defected.
Defecting produced a small-immediate reinforcer (consisting of points
convertible to gift cards) whereas cooperating increased the amount of
subsequent reinforcers, yielding a greater overall reinforcer rate.
Participants were normally free to cooperate or defect on each trial.
Additionally, they could choose to make a commitment response that
forced their choice for the ensuing five trials. For sonic participants,
the commitment response forced cooperation; for others, it forced
defection. Most participants, with either commitment response available,
chose to commit repeatedly despite a minor point loss for doing so.
After extended exposure to these contingencies, the commit-to-cooperate
group cooperated significantly more than a control group (with no
commitment available). The commit-to-defect group cooperated
significantly less than the control group. When both commitment
alternatives were simultaneously available-one for cooperation and one
for defection-cooperation commitment was strongly preferred. In
Experiment 2, the commitment alternative was removed at the end of the
session; gains in cooperation, relative to the con trol group, were not
sustained in the absence of the self-imposed behavioral scaffold.}"
"{Parties in real-world conflicts often attempt to punish each other's
behavior. If this strategy fails to produce mutual cooperation, they may
increase punishment magnitude. The present experiment investigated
whether delay reductionpotentially less harmful than magnitude
increasewould generate mutual cooperation as interactions are repeated.
The participants played a prisoner's dilemma game against a computer
that played a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperating after a participant
cooperated, defecting after a participant defected. For half the
participants, the delay between their choice and the computer's next
choice was long relative to the delay between the computer's choice and
their next choice. For the other half, long and short delays were
reversed. The tit-for-tat contingency reinforces the other player's
cooperation (by cooperating) and punishes the other player's defection
(by defecting). Both the rewards and the punishments are discounted by
delay. Consistent with delay discounting, the participants cooperated
more when the delay between their choice and the computer's cooperation
(reward) or defection (punishment) was relatively short. These results
suggest that, in real-world tit-for-tat conflicts, the decreasing delay
of reciprocation or retaliation may foster mutual cooperation as
effectively as (or more effectively than) the more usual tactic of
increasing magnitude of reciprocation or retaliation. Copyright (C) 2011

"{Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain an indispensable
form of human experimentation as a vehicle for discovery of new
treatments. However, since their inception RCTs have raised ethical
concerns. The ethical tension has revolved around ``duties to
individuals{''} vs. ``societal value{''} of RCTs. By asking current
patients ``to sacrifice for the benefit of future patients{''} we risk
subjugating our duties to patients' best interest to the utilitarian
goal for the good of others. This tension creates a key dilemma: when is
it rational, from the perspective of the trial patients and researchers
(as societal representatives of future patients), to enroll in RCTs?
Methods: We employed the trust version of the prisoner's dilemma since
interaction between the patient and researcher in the setting of a
clinical trial is inherently based on trust. We also took into account
that the patient may have regretted his/her decision to participate in
the trial, while a researcher may feel guilty because he/she abused the
patient's trust.
Results: We found that under typical circumstances of clinical research,
most patients can be expected not to trust researchers, and most
researchers can be expected to abuse the patients' trust. The most
significant factor determining trust was the success of experimental or
standard treatments, respectively. The more that a researcher believes
the experimental treatment will be successful, the more incentive the
researcher has to abuse trust. The analysis was sensitive to the
assumptions about the utilities related to success and failure of
therapies that are tested in RCTs. By varying all variables in the Monte
Carlo analysis we found that, on average, the researcher can be expected
to honor a patient's trust 41\% of the time, while the patient is
inclined to trust the researcher 69\% of the time. Under assumptions of
our model, enrollment into RCTs represents a rational strategy that can
meet both patients' and researchers' interests simultaneously 19\% of
the time.
Conclusions: There is an inherent ethical dilemma in the conduct of
RCTs. The factors that hamper full cooperation between patients and
researchers in the conduct of RCTs can be best addressed by: a) having
more reliable estimates on the probabilities that new vs. established
treatments will be successful, b) improving transparency in the clinical
trial system to ensure fulfillment of ``the social contract{''} between
patients and researchers.}"
"{Previous findings concerning the relation of risk aversion and
cooperation in repeated prisoner's dilemma games have been inconclusive.
We hypothesized that this was due to an interaction between personality
and environment. Specifically, we argued that in cooperation-friendly
environments-given certain beliefs-defection is more risky than
cooperation. The main reason for this is that, in such a situation,
defection potentially yields outcomes of higher variance (and vice
versa, for cooperation-unfriendly environments). In line with this
hypothesis, we showed, in two experiments and a reanalysis of a study by
Fudenberg, Rand, and Dreber ( in press), that the degree of cooperation
increases with dispositional risk aversion in cooperation-friendly
environments, but not in cooperation-unfriendly environments. We also
found similar person-situation interactions for neuroticism and
extraversion.}"
"{Research on video games has yielded consistent findings that violent
video games increase aggression and decrease prosocial behavior.
However, these studies typically examined single-player games. Of
interest is the effect of cooperative play in a violent video game on
subsequent cooperative or competitive behavior. Participants played Halo
II (a first-person shooter game) cooperatively or competitively and then
completed a modified prisoner's dilemma task to assess competitive and
cooperative behavior. Compared with the competitive play conditions,
players in the cooperative condition engaged in more tit-for-tat
behaviors-a pattern of behavior that typically precedes cooperative
behavior. The social context of game play influenced subsequent behavior
more than the content of the game that was played.}"
"{This paper analyzes learning in multi-player noncooperative games with
risky payoffs. The goal of the paper is to assess the relative
importance of stochastic payoffs and expected payoffs in the learning
process. A general learning model which nests several variations of
reinforcement learning, belief-based learning, and experience-weighted
attraction learning is used to analyze behavior in coordination game and
prisoner's dilemma experiments with probabilistic payoffs. In all
experiments, some subjects learn from past lottery outcomes, though the
importance of these stochastic payoffs relative to expected payoffs
depends on the game. Stochastic payoffs are less important when posted
probabilities are equal to expected payoffs and more important when
subjects are informed how much they would have earned from foregone
strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Previous research has posited that facial expressions of emotion may
serve as honest signals of cooperation. Although findings from several
empirical studies support this position, prior studies have not used
comprehensive and dynamic measures of facial expression as potential
predictors of behaviorally defined cooperation. The authors investigated
(a) specific positive and negative facial actions displayed among
strangers immediately following verbal promises of commitment within an
unrestricted acquaintance period and (b) anonymous, behaviorally defined
decisions of cooperation or defection in a one-shot, two-person
Prisoner's Dilemma game occurring directly following the acquaintance
period. The Facial Action Coding System {[}Ekman P. \& Friesen W.V.
(1978). Facial Action Coding System. Palo Alto, CA: Consulting
Psychology Press] was used to measure affect-related facial actions. It
was found that facial actions related to enjoyment were predictive of
cooperative decisions within dyads; additionally, facial actions related
to contempt were predictive of noncooperative decisions within dyads.
Furthermore, and consistent with previous works, participants were able
to accurately predict their partner's decisions following the
acquaintance period. These results suggest that facial actions may
function as honest signals of cooperative intent. These findings also
provide a possible explanation for the association between subjective
affective experience and facial expression that advances understanding
of cooperative behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"

"{The neural mechanisms supporting social bonds between adult men remain
uncertain. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we
investigate the impact of intranasally administered oxytocin (OT) and
vasopressin (AVP) on behavior and brain activity among men in the
context of an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, which models a real-life
social situation. fMRI results show that, relative to both AVP and
placebo, OT increases the caudate nucleus response to reciprocated
cooperation, which may augment the reward of reciprocated cooperation
and/or facilitate learning that another person can be trusted. OT also
enhances left amygdala activation in response to reciprocated
cooperation. Behaviorally, OT was associated with increased rates of
cooperation following unreciprocated cooperation in the previous round
compared with AVP. AVP strongly increased cooperation in response to a
cooperative gesture by the partner compared with both placebo and OT. In
response to reciprocated cooperation, AVP increased activation in a
region spanning known vasopressin circuitry implicated in affiliative
behaviors in other species. Finally, both OT and AVP increase amygdala
functional connectivity with the anterior insula relative to placebo,
which may increase the amygdala's ability to elicit visceral somatic
markers that guide decision making. These findings extend our knowledge
of the neural and behavioral effects of OT and AVP to the context of
genuine social interactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{The authors examined how conciliatory gestures exhibited in response to
interpersonal transgressions influence forgiveness and feelings of
friendship with the transgressor. In Study 1, 163 undergraduates who had
recently been harmed were examined longitudinally. Conciliatory gestures
exhibited by transgressors predicted higher rates of forgiveness over 21
days, and this relationship was mediated by victims perceptions of their
transgressors Agreeableness. Study 2 was an experiment including 145
undergraduates who experienced a breach in trust from an anonymous
partner during an iterated prisoner's dilemma. When transgressors
apologized and offered financial compensation, participants reported
higher levels of forgiveness and feelings of friendship when compared to
a control condition and an aggravating condition. The effects of
apology/compensation on forgiveness and perceived friendship were
mediated by victims perceptions of their transgressors Agreeableness.
Results suggest that conciliatory gestures promote forgiveness in part

"{Background: Although evolutionary models of cooperation build on the
intuition that costs of the donor and benefits to the receiver are the
most general fundamental parameters, it is largely unknown how they
affect the decision of animals to cooperate with an unrelated social
partner. Here we test experimentally whether costs to the donor and need
of the receiver decide about the amount of help provided by unrelated
rats in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game.
Results: Fourteen unrelated Norway rats were alternately presented to a
cooperative or defective partner for whom they could provide food via a
mechanical apparatus. Direct costs for this task and the need of the
receiver were manipulated in two separate experiments. Rats provided
more food to cooperative partners than to defectors (direct
reciprocity). The propensity to discriminate between helpful and
non-helpful social partners was contingent on costs: An experimentally
increased resistance in one Newton steps to pull food for the social
partner reduced the help provided to defectors more strongly than the
help returned to cooperators. Furthermore, test rats provided more help
to hungry receivers that were light or in poor condition, which might
suggest empathy, whereas this relationship was inverse when experimental
partners were satiated.
Conclusions: In a prisoner's dilemma situation rats seem to take effect
of own costs and potential benefits to a receiver when deciding about
helping a social partner, which confirms the predictions of reciprocal
cooperation. Thus, factors that had been believed to be largely confined
to human social behaviour apparently influence the behaviour of other
social animals as well, despite widespread scepticism. Therefore our
results shed new light on the biological basis of reciprocity.}"
"{We propose a novel experimental method that disentangles strategically-
and non-strategically-motivated behavior. We apply it to an
indefinitely-repeated prisoner's dilemma game to observe simultaneously
how the same individual behaves in situations with future interaction
and in situations with no future interaction, while controlling for
expectations. This method allows us to determine the extent to which
strategically-cooperating individuals are responsible for the observed
pattern of cooperation in experiments with repeated interaction,
including the so-called endgame effect. Our results indicate that the
most common motive for cooperation in repeated games is strategic.}"
"{We study prisoners' dilemmas played in continuous time with flow payoffs
accumulated over 60 seconds. In most cases, the median rate of mutual
cooperation is about 90 percent. Control sessions with repeated
matchings over eight subperiods achieve less than half as much
cooperation, and cooperation rates approach zero in one-shot sessions.
In follow-up sessions with a variable number of subperiods, cooperation
rates increase nearly linearly as the grid size decreases, and, with
one-second subperiods, they approach continuous levels. Our data support
a strand of theory that explains how capacity to respond rapidly
stabilizes cooperation and destabilizes defection in the prisoner's
dilemma.}"

products of the interrelated behavior of four players. Results of the
first experiment showed that cultural level consequences ({''}market

on aggregate products XXXX or YYYY increased the frequency of those
productions. In subsequent experiments we added a baseline condition
where the players experienced only the individual behavioral
contingencies embedded in the game. Then we imposed the metacontingency
on the XXXX aggregate product or, alternatively, on YYYY. After several
reversals, we discontinued the metacontingency and the players again
experienced only the individual contingencies of the game. In one
experiment we used a yoked control to assess the effect of market
feedback independent from the metacontingency relation. Results indicate
that the cultural consequence (market feedback) controlled production of
aggregate products even when its magnitude was minimal, that the
metacontingency relation was necessary, and that it maintained relations
among the behavior of individuals which resulted in the worst individual
outcomes for all players.}"

Verbal behavior was allowed in one group (GV), and for the last session

mental states) and stereotyping (using general assumptions about a group
to intuit a counterpart's mental states). Study 1 extends prior work on
perceptual dilemmas in arms races, examining Americans' perceptions of
Chinese attitudes toward military escalation. Study 2 adapts a
prisoner's dilemma, pairing participants with outgroup targets. Study 3
employs an ultimatum game, asking male and female participants to make
judgments about opposite sex partners. Study 4 manipulates perceived
similarity as well as counterpart stereotype in a principal-agent
context. Across the studies, we find evidence for our central
prediction: higher levels of perceived similarity are associated with
increased projection and reduced stereotyping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"{Perception and misperception play a pivotal role in conflict and
negotiation. We introduce a framework that explains how people think
about their outcome interdependence in conflict and negotiation and how
their views shape their behavior. Seven studies show that people's
mental representations of conflict are predictably constrained to a
small set of possibilities with important behavioral and social
consequences. Studies 1 and 2 found that, when prompted to represent a
conflict in matrix form, more than 70\% of the people created 1 of 4
archetypal mixed-motive games (out of 576 possibilities): Maximizing
Difference, Assurance, Chicken, and Prisoner's Dilemma. Study 3
demonstrated that these mental representations relate in predictable
ways to negotiators' fixed-pie perceptions. Studies 4-6 showed that
these mental representations shape individuals' behavior and
interactions with others, including cooperation, perspective taking, and
use of deception in negotiation, and through them, conflict's outcomes.
Study 7 found that the games that people think they are playing
influence how their counterparts see them, as well as their
counterparts' negotiation expectations. Overall, the findings document
noteworthy regularities in people's mental representations of outcome
interdependence in conflict and illustrate that 4 archetypal games can
encapsulate fundamental psychological processes that emerge repeatedly
in conflict and negotiation.}"

(Study 1, N = 88), or photographs of people playing PD taken at the very
moment when they were expressing a decision to cooperate or to defect
(Study 2, N = 99). We found relationships between ToM and cooperative
intention recognition only in Study 1, when participants were exposed to
long versions of the video clips. In contrast to previous reports,
participants in our samples did not score higher than chance in
cooperativeness assessment except for Study 1 in the condition with
short video clips. Our results question human expertise at identifying
defectors and cooperators and do not provide clear support for an
association between ToM and cooperativeness assessment. The findings are
discussed from the perspective of an evolutionary arms race between
interpreting and masking cooperative intentions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"{We examine cooperative behavior when large sums of money are at stake,
using data from the television game show Golden Balls. At the end of
each episode, contestants play a variant on the classic prisoner's
dilemma for large and widely ranging stakes averaging over \$20,000.
Cooperation is surprisingly high for amounts that would normally be
considered consequential but look tiny in their current context, what we
call a ``big peanuts{''} phenomenon. Utilizing the prior interaction
among contestants, we find evidence that people have reciprocal
preferences. Surprisingly, there is little support for conditional
cooperation in our sample. That is, players do not seem to be more
likely to cooperate if their opponent might be expected to cooperate.
Further, we replicate earlier findings that males are less cooperative
than females, but this gender effect reverses for older contestants
because men become increasingly cooperative as their age increases.}"
"{This study uses fMRI to investigate the cognitive demands of
decision-making in two types of cooperation games: a prisoner's dilemma
(PD) eliciting a temptation to free-ride, leading to a dominant,
self-interested response, and a stag hunt (SH) that has no dominant
response but offers pay-off incentives that make mutual cooperation
collectively beneficial but risky. Consequently, the PD poses greater
conflict between self-and collective interest, greater demands for
computational reasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater
demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent
with these differences between the two games, the results indicate that
the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate
gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction.
With less conflict, the demands for computation and mentalizing are
reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The
differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentive
structures of the PD and the SH appear to be independent of individual
differences in revealed social preferences.}"
"We conducted two studies to explain inconsistent findings on the effect of resource inequality based on two properties of heterogeneity: (a) level of inequality and (b) asymmetry of resource distribution. We confirmed that symmetrically heterogeneous groups cooperated less than homogeneous groups did. We also found that larger resource inequality led to less cooperation. More importantly, the effect of inequality was different among groups with different distributions of resources—cooperation declined in groups with a symmetrical distribution of resources but did not decline in groups with a hegemonic distribution. Hegemonic distribution also affected psychological states as resource inequality changed. High endowment members reported higher self-efficacy when distribution was hegemonic than symmetric. However, they also reported more fear of being a sucker in hegemonic groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Research suggests that contribution to public goods (i.e. cooperation) will increase when groups use sanctions. We argue that when groups use rewards and punishments to induce members to cooperate in a social dilemma, individuals’ natural propensity to cooperate may be reduced. Results from two laboratory experiments provide consistent support for our hypothesis. Specifically, we found that cooperation (in groups that adopted sanctioning systems, including both reward and punishment) decreased significantly following the removal of sanctioning systems. We also found that a moral appeal to cooperate was as effective as sanctions in inducing cooperation. Moreover, cooperation induced through appeals was more likely to sustain than that induced through sanctions. We found that people’s trust in others’ cooperation mediated the relationship between the use of sanctions and appeals and the level of cooperation after these inducing practices were removed. Implications of these results are discussed in the group and organizational context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In this study we examined how perceived group norm and group identity influence individual cooperative behavior in a public goods dilemma across cultural settings. Six hundred and eight students in the United States and People's Republic of China participated in a laboratory experiment in which group norm and group identity were manipulated and the individual cultural orientations of idiocentrism and allocentrism were measured. We found that idiocentrism and allocentrism moderated the relationship between perceived group norm and cooperation but not between group identity and cooperation. In particular, members who endorsed allocentrism to a greater extent cooperated more when they perceived a more cooperative group norm than did members who endorsed lower levels of allocentrism. On the other hand, people scored high on idiocentrism cooperated less when perceiving a more cooperative norm than did people scored low on idiocentrism. The results suggest that allocentrics are not cooperative in every context but are rather highly sensitive to social cues whereas idiocentrics, while tending to behave in a way that maximizes personal outcomes at the expense of the group, are also somewhat aloof to the situation.

"The present research examined the extent to which feeling respected, versus feeling disrespected, influences people's willingness to contribute to the public good. Further, it was investigated why such a positive effect of respect should occur. The findings showed that respect indeed had a positive influence on contributions. In addition, it was shown that respect also positively influenced people's feelings of belongingness and that this feeling was found to mediate the effect of respect on contributions. These findings thus indicate that research on social decision-making, and more specifically social dilemmas, has to start devoting more attention to people's noneconomic motives that are independent of outcome concerns when explaining the act of cooperation.

"The problem of collective action occurs when individual and collective interests are at odds. Actors in social dilemmas are typically confronted with two choices: to cooperate with group interests, often at some expense of self-interest, or to free-ride off others' cooperation. A dilemma thus ensues in that the individually rational strategy of free-riding leads to failure in the group's efforts to achieve the desired ends of its members. In this dissertation, I focus on actors' perceptions of free-riding. Specifically, I use Markovsky's (1985) multilevel justice theory to compare the effects of emphasizing actual contributions to the group effort versus contributions relative to ability to contribute. I argue that focusing on absolute contributions makes actors more sympathetic toward group members with the least to contribute to the group. Focusing on relative contributions, however, shifts actors' sympathies toward those with the most to contribute to the group. I conducted two experiments to test for these effects. In Experiment 1, I focused on how cooperation is enforced through costly punishment. Experiment 2 incorporates a retaliation mechanism into Experiment 1, thus testing for reactions to being punished unfairly. The findings of both experiments were generally consistent with the argument. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The Greed-Efficiency-Fairness (GEF) hypothesis states that people in resource dilemmas are greedy and wish to defect, but that greed is constrained by preferences for efficient resource use and fair distributions. This paper reviews research where the GEF hypothesis was generalized to public-goods dilemmas. Results from both surveys and experiments on people's willingness to contribute to resources for social services were interpreted in light of the GEF hypothesis. Whereas earlier research on social dilemmas and fairness considerations have focused on the correlation between estimated fair and actual cooperation rates, the present results provide an extension where cooperation rates are influenced by perceived fairness of how a resource is distributed. Two experiments contribute further insights into the interplay, in terms of effects on cooperation, between greed, efficiency, and fairness. The collective consequences of individual choices were either highlighted or not (Experiment 1) and the outcome structure in prior social dilemma tasks was either collectively or individually framed (Experiment 2). These manipulations influenced (a) cooperation rates and (b) the extent to which decisions were based on greed, efficiency, or fairness (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The study investigated the effects of information structure on people's investment behaviors in a Continuous Public Goods Dilemma under a real-time self-paced sequential protocol (SPS) of games. The results showed that information about previous cooperative choices enhanced the followers' cooperation ratio at the beginning and in the middle of the decision process; but at the end of the process, the participants showed an obvious free riding or fearing of being sucked, then behaved very competitively; the information about previous competitive choices reduced the followers' cooperation ratio during the whole decision process; without any information provided, it seemed that the participants all rushed to the beginning of the process to make decisions and showed cooperation behavior to some extent.

"For three decades, behavioral economists and social psychologists studying experimental public good dilemmas have consistently observed that contributions to public goods decline over time. Game theorists have simultaneously made the normative argument that, in social dilemmas with fixed end-points, cooperative behavior is 'irrational.' This dissertation presents the results of three studies that challenge both the generality of the previous empirical findings and the presumed efficacy of the normative prescription by identifying a key condition under which cooperation can be sustained and effective. Using archival data, Study 1 documented a 'consistent contributor effect'-how a consistent cooperator influences others, resulting in higher contribution levels within their groups, and superior outcomes for consistent contributors across groups. Study 2 experimentally manipulated the presence of a consistent contributor (CC) and replicated the findings from Study 1, thereby strengthening causal inference. Study 3 tested the impact of consistent contributor characteristics on their efficacy in yielding the CC effect. Smart 'high status' CCs were found to have a marginally greater impact on others' choices than 'lower status' CCs did, but both high and low status CCs elicited the effect relative to control groups. Although both high and low status CCs elicited the effect, only high status CCs were given credit by their fellow group members for being influential. Taken together, the behavioral results and the results of supplementary questionnaire data suggest that the mechanisms driving the consistent contributor effect include the norm of reciprocity (experience of social obligation), the establishment and encouragement of cooperative social norms, and the material and psychological reduction of risk perceptions for CCs' fellow group members. Results have implications for how we think about what constitutes 'rational choice,' and how we implement and teach strategic analysis and action.

"Tolerance of free riding is defined as 'the extent to which group members are willing to continue cooperation after observing other members' defection behavior in a social dilemma.' We hypothesized that defection size (number of other members who defect), defection pattern (how other members' defection choices are repeated), and social orientation (individual preference for different distributions of resources for self and/or others) would influence members' level of tolerance in a repeated public goods dilemma. One hundred and ten business students participated in a computerized laboratory experiment in which four conditions were created: the same one (or two) members defect over all trials--a fixed pattern, or a different one (or two) members defect on different trials--a diffused pattern. Results show that the effects of social orientation and defection size were initially significant but diminished over trials. In contrast, the effects of defection pattern became increasingly significant over trials. Specifically, we found that members' tolerance level was significantly higher in conditions where a diffused rather than a fixed pattern of defection was observed. A 'perceived impact' hypothesis was proposed to explain these results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Presents a brief theoretical overview about the role of trust in promoting cooperation in public goods dilemmas. This study has been conducted to explore the different psychological variables which are related to trust and which may help clarify the role of trust in public goods dilemmas. This article proposes some theoretical assumptions which explain that trust reduces people's experiences of fear of exploitation. This article also relates the concept of trust to perceptions of fairness and collective efficacy. 47 college students participated in this study which is presented to test these assumptions. Results show that trust seems to have an effect on people's experiences of fear and, even more importantly, the power of trust to reduce fear seems to be strongly related to perceptions of fairness and collective efficacy.

"Conducted 2 experiments with a total of 119 undergraduates to test (1) whether Ss in an objectively critical (perceived effective) group position would be more likely to contribute to maximize public good than would Ss in a less critical group position if the level of uncertainty is low, and (2) whether Ss in both objectively critical and noncritical positions would be less likely to contribute when uncertainty is high than when uncertainty is low. Exp 1 examined the general effects of criticality and uncertainty on cooperative behavior in 4-person groups. Exp 2 tested the generalizability of the results obtained in Exp 1 using 6-person groups and examined the interaction effects between uncertainty and criticality. Results support the idea that criticality affects contribution rates for the establishment of public good and suggest that criticality does not uniformly enhance cooperation; its effect is moderated by the perception of criticality.

A 2 x 2 factorial experiment measures the effect of framing games as give or take on level of cooperation. The effects are examined in static and dynamic settings.

However, an interaction effect of time and frame is found in games with a dynamic function. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This paper investigates the effects of risk orientation (RO) and social value orientation (SVO) on cooperation and the process of making the decision in a public goods dilemma (PGD). We found in Study 1 that risk-seeking prosocials were more cooperative than risk-averse prosocials in a simultaneous PGD. In Study 2, we found the same effect of RO on cooperation in a real-time PGD. Moreover, we found that risk-seeking prosocials, compared with their risk-averse counterparts, took less time to make decisions and observed fewer preceding cooperation choices before making their decisions. Mediation analysis confirms our model based on the change of K’ index in real-time PGD: The number of preceding cooperation choices being observed by a player mediated the effect of RO on cooperation among prosocials that risk-seekers were more cooperative than risk-averse participants. Our studies illustrate that individual differences such as RO and SVO play an important role in decision processes in PGD that subsequently affects cooperation decisions.

"Empirical findings on public goods dilemmas indicate an unresolved dilemma: that increasing size—the number of people in the dilemma—sometimes increases, decreases, or does not influence cooperation. We clarify this dilemma by first classifying public goods dilemma properties that specify individual outcomes as individual properties (e.g., Marginal Per Capita Return) and group outcomes as group properties (e.g., public good multiplier), mathematically showing how only one set of properties can remain constant as the dilemma size increases. Underpinning decision-making regarding individual and group properties, we propose that individuals are motivated by both individual and group preferences based on a theory of collective rationality. We use Van Lange's integrated model of social value orientations to operationalize these preferences as an amalgamation of outcomes for self, outcomes for others, and equality of outcomes. Based on this model, we then predict how the public good's benefit and size, combined with controlling individual versus group properties, produce different levels of cooperation in public goods dilemmas. A two (low vs. high benefit) by three (2-person baseline vs. 5-person holding constant individual properties vs. 5-person holding constant group properties) factorial experiment (group n = 99; participant n = 390) confirms our hypotheses. The results indicate that when holding constant group properties, size decreases cooperation. Yet when holding constant individual properties, size increases cooperation when benefit is low and does not affect cooperation when benefit is high. Using agent-based simulations of individual and group preferences vis-à-vis the integrative model, we fit a weighted simulation model to the empirical data. This fitted model is sufficient to reproduce the empirical results, but only when both individual (self-interest) and group (other-interest and equality) preference are included. Our research contributes to understanding how people's motivations and behaviors within public goods dilemmas interact with the properties of the dilemma to lead to collective outcomes.

"Cooperation in biological, social, and economic groups is underpinned by public goods that are generated by group members at some personal cost. Theory predicts that public goods will be exploited by cheaters who benefit from the goods by not paying for them, thereby leading to the collapse of cooperation. This situation, described as the 'public goods dilemma' in game theory, makes the ubiquity of cooperation a major evolutionary puzzle. Despite this generalization, the demonstration of genetic background and fitness effects of the public goods dilemma has been limited to interactions between viruses and between cells, and thus its relevance at higher levels of organismal complexity is still largely unexplored. Here we provide experimental evidence for the public goods dilemma in a social insect, the ant Pristomyrmexpunctatus. In this species, all workers are involved in both asexual reproduction and cooperative tasks. Genetic cheaters infiltrate field colonies, reproducing more than the workers but shunning cooperative tasks. In laboratory experiments, cheaters outcompeted coexisting workers in both survival and reproduction, although a group composed only of cheaters failed to produce offspring. The operations of the public goods dilemma in P. punctatus showed a remarkable convergence with those in microbial societies, not only in fitness consequences but also in behavioral mechanisms. Our study reinforces the evolutionary impact of cheaters on diverse cooperative systems in the laboratory and in the field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

"According to Self-Categorization Theory, people may define their self-concept in terms of collective identity when engaged in intergroup comparisons and in terms of personal identity when engaged in interpersonal comparisons. This difference in level of categorization (collective versus personal identity) is believed to affect the extent people identify with their group and subsequently their behavior in social dilemma situations. The present study investigated whether people contribute more in a public goods dilemma when collective identity is made salient than when personal identity is made salient, and further which processes may underlie this behavioral effect. Ss were 93 undergraduates. Results reveal that people identified more strongly with the collective and contributed more when collective identity was made salient compared to when personal identity was made salient. Furthermore, this behavioral effect seemed to be mediated by perceptions of self-efficacy rather than by perceptions of the trustworthiness of people's fellow group members.

"This paper compares behavior of heterogeneous groups with homogeneous groups in public goods production. In heterogeneous groups members differ in their opportunity costs of contribution, while in homogeneous groups, members have the same opportunity costs. Members of three-player groups sequentially make all-or-nothing contributions towards the production of a public good where contribution decisions, payoffs, and opportunity costs of preceding players in the group are known to each group member. We find that heterogeneous groups perform better than homogeneous groups controlling for average opportunity costs at the group level. Our results also indicate that subjects develop an endogenous contribution norm to sustain public goods production where subjects in the first positions, and subjects with relatively low opportunity costs contribute most often.

"This study examined how order of contribution in a sequential public goods dilemma affected cooperation. Under a sequential protocol of play, players of different levels of efficacy made decisions one after another. We contrasted a High-to-low versus Low-to-high Efficacy order in a nine-person game. Under a High-to-low order, high-efficacy players made decisions in positions 1-3, medium-efficacy players in positions 4-6, and low-efficacy players in positions 7-9. Under a Low-to-high order, the positions of high- and low-efficacy players were reversed. We hypothesized that cooperation rates would be higher in the High-to-low order that high-efficacy players (assigned in early positions), who would likely cooperate, would induce subsequent players to cooperate also. We found the anticipated effect that cooperation rate was higher in the High-to-low than the Low-to-high efficacy order. The efficacy order effect was the most prominent when people perceived that their group was becoming uncooperative. This study illustrates a new type of structural solution to social dilemmas that by systematically assigning people to different sequential positions, a group can be made more or less cooperative.

"Social norms influence many behaviors, including cooperation. This study examined the use of Prosocial and Proself Injunctive and Descriptive norms in a public goods dilemma. The Big Five personality dimensions, Schwartz's (1992) 4 universal value domains, gender, and social responsibility were also examined. 333 undergraduate students were exposed to purported data for the norm manipulation. They next played a single trial of a public goods dilemma in groups of 5, and responded to a series of questionnaires related to the individual difference variables already listed. Only the Descriptive norms influenced contribution amount. Although the Injunctive manipulation appeared unsuccessful, the Injunctive norms seem to have some influence on the data, particularly with social responsibility. When looking at solely the Descriptive norm conditions, some regression models change in significance from when the broad Proself and Prosocial categories are used. In particular, significance is lost for Extraversion and Neuroticism with contribution amount as the criterion, and with social responsibility as the criterion significance is lost for Extraversion, Agreeableness, self-transcendence, and openness to change. At no point does any model change from nonsignificant to significant when only the Descriptive conditions are considered. This pattern indirectly suggests the role of the Injunctive norms. Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, and conservation maintain significance regardless of condition when amount of contribution is considered. Those high in Extraversion and low in Agreeableness made contributions that varied by condition (Proself, Control, Prosocial). With both, they gave the least in the Proself conditions and the most in the Prosocial conditions. Women had a higher sense of social responsibility, overall, but there was no gender difference related to contribution behavior. Despite some previous findings, social responsibility did not correlate with contribution behavior. This study lends support for the use of social norms in soliciting donations for non-profit organizations, and caution in utilizing uncooperative social norms. A field study should be conducted in the future to increase external validity. Additionally, it seems likely that the norms will be more influential in a natural setting with a concrete situation. Additional findings are presented and further discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Results reveal (1) the effects of 2 types of trust were contingent upon opportunity for communication, (2) communication type strongly affected specific trust towards the partner with whom communication had taken place, and (3) uncooperative communication contributed to the cooperation rates indirectly through specific trust towards the communicated partner, whereas cooperative communication explained the cooperation rates directly.

"Examined how the existence of multiple prisoner's dilemma (PD) relationships influences the development of a network system among 72 college students, and the behavior in each PD relationship. In 1 condition (network condition), Ss were required to make a 2-step decision. The 1st step was to choose a game partner from the 4- member group. The 2nd step was to determine how much one should cooperate with the partner in the PD relationships. Repeated trials included both decision steps. In the 2nd condition (2- person PD condition), Ss could not choose their partner, and were required to repeatedly play the PD game with the same partner. Results show that: (1) in the network condition, a commitment between partners developed spontaneously; (2) rate of cooperation increased in members who had established a commitment vs the trial when one had yet to establish such a commitment; and (3) the cooperative relationship was more firmly maintained in the network condition than in the 2-person PD condition.

"Competition is an inextricable part of our daily life. Why does cooperation routinely occur without coercion? One answer is that we are playing a game called the Prisoner's Dilemma. The Prisoner's Dilemma game poses a paradox--the rational player will never choose to cooperate. Yet when people play the game they frequently do cooperate. This was explicitly demonstrated by Rapoport's Prisoner's Dilemma study. As part of his study, Rapoport developed a stochastic learning model to help explain the human behavior he observed in the Infinitely Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (IRPD) game. That model has weaknesses, however, including its inability to autonomously adapt when the rules of the game change. This is unfortunate because an adaptive IRPD-game learning model would be of benefit to the study of cooperative behavior between autonomous agents such as people and organizations and in the design of intelligent software agents. Bock's collective learning systems (CLS) theory provides an adaptative alternative to Rapoport's stochastic learning model. In this dissertation, we develop the personality-moderated collective learning (PMCL) model, build computer programs to simulate PMCL agents playing the IRPD game, and conduct Monte Carlo experiments. PMCL agents playing the IRPD game, and conduct Monte Carlo experiments. PMCL agents have temperament and attitude as personality factors. Our study confirms that collective learning allows diversity, consistency with Rapoport's study, and adaptability in intelligent software agents playing the IRPD game. Additionally, the study shows that small differences in PMCL agent personality can generate significant differences in IRPD-game behavior. The dissertation ends with a discussion on the applicability of PMCL for modeling human personality. The importance of this study is that it presents a new way of modeling the problem of cooperation between autonomous agents. Significant contributions include: (1) extending Bock's CLS theory to the IRPD problem, (2) developing the PMCL model, a new formulation of stochastic learning that does not have the weaknesses of Rapoport's stochastic learning model, and (3) introducing the concepts, attitude and temperament, to CLS theory. Intelligent software agents can be constructed with PMCL-based mechanisms and can then be organized into systems of adaptably-cooperative intelligent software agents. Additionally, the effect of artificial personality on autonomous agent behavior can be computationally modeled and studied. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

In Study 1, LT Ss reacted to the competitive message by decreasing cooperation but were unaffected by the cooperative message; HT Ss reacted to the cooperative message by increasing cooperation but were unaffected by the competitive message. Study 2 showed that a period of unconditional, message-consistent behavior immediately after the message can make LT and HT Ss responsive to cooperative and competitive messages, respectively. However, the number of unconditional responses was crucial. The study also found that stated intention and message-inconsistent behavior affect perceptions of the opponent's trustworthiness.

There were three confederates used in the study: an underweight woman, a normal weight woman, and an overweight woman. The weight of the opponents (confederates) served as an independent variable, whereas each subject was randomly assigned to one of these opponents to play in the contrived game. The observed frequency of competitive responses from the Prisoner's Dilemma Game served as a behavioral measure of competitiveness. Subjects also completed two self-report measures of competitiveness: the Situational Scale of Competitiveness and the Competitiveness Index. It was hypothesized that the bulimics would score higher on all three measures of competitiveness (observed frequency of competitive responses from the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, the Situational Scale of Competitiveness, and the Competitiveness Index). Also, an interaction was predicted between the subject groups and the weight of the opponents with regard to competitive responses on the Prisoner's Dilemma Game and self-reported scores on the Situational Scale of Competitiveness. It was expected that the bulimic subjects would be more competitive as the weight of the opponent/confederate decreased, whereas the competitiveness of the nonbulimics would not change as a function of the weight of th (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Two experiments tested a geometric choice model based on Doi's (1990) Characteristic Space Theory. The model represents Social Orientation (an intrapersonal characteristic) and the payoff structure of 2 x 2 symmetric matrix games (a property of the external environment) as vectors in a single two-dimensional space developed by Griesinger and Livingston (1973). These vectors are symbolized theta and theta' respectively. The model predicts that a subject will choose prosocially if theta >theta', non-prosocially if theta <theta', and will be indifferent if theta = theta'. Experiment 1 was a conceptual replication of Camac (1986). Subjects were classified as Cooperative, Individualistic, or Competitive with decomposed games. They then responded to four sets of eight Prisoner's Dilemma games varying from theta' = 39 to theta' = 6. A 3 (theta) by 8 theta') mixed-design MANOVA revealed significant main and interactive effects for theta and theta'. Stepdown F tests confirmed the prediction that Cooperators and Individualists would be responsive to the linear component of theta' and Competitors would be unresponsive. This finding supports the notion that Social Orientation plays an important role in interdependent decision making, at least in the Prisoner's Dilemma payoff structure. In experiment 2 the model was extended by including three new classes of one-shot matrix games besides Prisoner's Dilemma: Convergence, Maximizing Difference, and Spite. Consistent with our predictions, the level of prosocial choice systematically increased from Convergence to Prisoner's Dilemma to Maximizing Difference and Spite. Importantly, results also showed that subjects' responsiveness to payoff variations within each class of matrix game was moderated by Social Orientation. The procedures for experiment 2 also allowed for a separate assessmen (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This study examines the social structure of cooperation and competition in the aged parent and adult child relationship. Elderly parents and adult children may use different strategies to influence each other to resolve conflicts in a way which is mutually rewarding. Using game theory, data (N = 13 dyads) were collected from two mixed-motive games of cooperation and conflict--Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken. In particular, the present study explored the emergence of intergenerational cooperation between elderly parents and their adult children; aged parents and adult children dyads were classified into different response state groups regarding their reactive cooperative or competitive strategies; the relation between a dyad's perception of each other while engaged in a conflict situation was examined; and social and personal characteristics were related to each outcome group. On the basis of the subjects' interaction, dyads were classified into four stable response outcome groups: (a) cooperators (Doves); (b) competitors (Hawks); (c) dominant-submissive (Dom-Sub); and (d) moderate cooperators (Sneakers). Analysis of their preasymptotic interaction patterns revealed differences among these outcome groups. In particular, Doves made more intentions and actual cooperative behavior than the other dyads. Results also indicated a significant effect for the type of conflict: high conflict situation (Chicken game) versus low conflict situation (Prisoner's dilemma), over couples' strategic variables. No differences were found with regard of the subject's personal and social characteristics and their classification into each outcome group.

In addition, parents described incidents designed to reveal their promise fulfillment to their children. Positive correlations were found between: (1) mothers' promise fulfillment to their children and their children's trust beliefs in mothers, fathers, and teachers; and (2) mothers' trust beliefs and their children's trust beliefs in teachers. Additionally, fathers' promised cooperation in the PD game was correlated with their children's promised cooperation in the PD game in interactions with fathers, mothers, and strangers.

"Examined how prosocial and proself individuals would respond to a serious environmental threat in their personal commuting situation. The sample included 31 female and 25 male Dutch adults. Ss were assessed for social value orientation and responded to simulated commuting situations. It was proposed that the commuting situation could be viewed either as an environmental issue, reflecting the decision structure of an N-person Prisoner's Dilemma, or as an accessibility problem, reflecting the decision structure of an N-person Chicken Dilemma. On the basis of interdependence theory (H. H. Kelly and J. W. Thibaut, 1978), it was predicted that people who are primarily concerned with the collective welfare (prosocial individuals) would prefer commuting by public transportation when other commuters were expected to go by public transportation.

"Three studies examined the perceived interdependence structure (PIDS) underlying commuting decisions (i.e., commuting to work by car or public transportation). In Study 1, 284 U.S. college students rated the attractiveness of four hypothetical outcomes in a 2 x 2 commuters' matrix (self car/pt x others car/pt). PIDSs were classified into one of four categories, and were subsequently analyzed in terms of three underlying preference components: preference for self (car/pt), others (car/pt), and coordination (avoid/join others). Results revealed a strong relationship between individual and collective travel concerns and PIDS, and between PIDS and commuting intentions, with the underlying components explaining the largest amount of variance in commuting intentions. Study 2 (N = 164, U.S. college students) examined the influence of two travel concerns (time, convenience), and three dispositional measures (social value orientation, trust, and perceived environmental impact of cars) on the PIDS (i.e., the given and effective matrices, respectively). Results supported Van Vugt, Meertens, & Van Lange's (1995) hypothesis that travel time results in a PIDS similar to a Chicken Dilemma while convenience leads to a PIDS similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Also, when the perceived environmental impact of cars was low, prosocials exhibited a weaker overall preference for the car, relative to proselfs. Study 3 replicated Study 2 on a sample of 88 Dutch commuters. Results were generally consistent with those reported in Study 2. In contrast to the findings from Study 2, and consistent with Pruitt & Kimmel's (1977) goal/expectation hypothesis, high trust prosocials exhibited more collectively-beneficial preferences than the low trust prosocials, and proselfs combined.

"The purpose of the current research was to investigate the associations between an individual's trust for a dating relationship partner, and that individual's affect, expectations about partner behavior, and attempts to influence partner behavior, as heterosexual dating couples prepared to engage in a mixed-motive or 'Prisoner's Dilemma' interaction. In addition, the current research explored the link between trust and a person's reaction to a bogus message from his or her partner that was either highly directive, requesting cooperation throughout the mixed-motive interaction, or nondirective and ambiguous, leaving behavioral choices almost entirely up to the partner. Participants' beliefs about the extent of their partners' trust were also measured, along with relationship closeness and commitment. Interactions between trust and closeness, and perceived trust and closeness, were obtained in this study. Respondents who held somewhat positive but uncertain views of partner trustworthiness (those who were low in closeness, but moderate in trust) made a greater effort to directly and specifically influence partner mixed-motive choices than did other participants; low-close, moderate-trust individuals also showed the strongest reactions to bogus partner messages. Further interactions of trust and closeness with gender were also observed, as well as interactions between closeness and perceptions of partner trust. Implications of the results for understanding the interplay of trust and closeness as couples encounter a novel and trust-relevant situation are discussed.

"Using an intergroup prisoner's dilemma paradigm, this experiment examined whether individual's outgroup attitude inferences, trait inferences, expectations of outgroup cooperation, and own decision behavior are influenced by biased perceptions of the outgroup's previous decision. Subjects were informed of (a) the distribution of outgroup member's decisions, (b) the decision rule used to combine individual outgroup member's decisions into a group decision, and (c) the outgroup's final decision for their previous interaction. The outgroup previous decision was manipulated by changing the decision rule while holding constant the number of cooperative outgroup members' choices. The results demonstrate that subjects' outgroup attitude inferences and expectation of outgroup cooperation display the correspondence bias. Subjects inferred that the typical member of a previously cooperative outgroup held more cooperative attitudes than the typical member of a previously defecting outgroup. Furthermore, outgroups with a previous history of cooperation were perceived as more likely to cooperate in the future than previously defecting outgroups. Subjects' decision behavior displayed a high degree of defection, and was not affected by the manipulation of previous outgroup decision. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"According to interpersonal theorists and researchers, one of the basic motivations governing human interactions is that individuals will seek out complementary relationships which confirm their self-concepts. Although the tenets of interpersonal theory have long been accepted as a theoretical framework guiding clinical interventions, empirical studies examining the complementarity hypothesis have yielded mixed results. Reviewers have suggested that basic research was necessary to identify the preferences and behaviors associated with the hostile and friendly interpersonal styles, as well as to evaluate the possible ways in which intervening variables, such as sex of interactants and situational preferences for competition versus cooperation, may influence the behavioral display of interpersonal styles. The present research was focused on evaluating 98 subjects (49 male and 49 female), from each of the four quadrants of the interpersonal circumplex, to determine the manner in which situational congruity and sex of interactants may act as intervening variables to influence the display of interpersonal styles and complementarity. Utilizing prisoner's dilemma game methodology, it was found that friendly style individuals more often preferred to interact in cooperative contexts than did hostile-style individuals, while hostile style individuals more often preferred to interact in competitive contexts than friendly-style individuals. These affiliative-style preferences are consistent with interpersonal theory and suggest that the assessment of friendly-style complementarity may be best conducted under cooperative conditions, while the assessment of hostile-style complementarity may be best conducted under competitive conditions. Results of the present investigation also showed that sex of subjects and sex of 'partners' tended to impact how much subjects reported liking their partners, with female cooperative partners being liked most.

"The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between certain scoring patterns on the Rorschach and the Picture Projective Test and several aspects of prosocial orientation. It was proposed that projective test responses contain non-pathological material that may provide a measure of interpersonal relatedness. The standard clinical battery currently lacks such a measure. Fifty-eight subjects (28 men and 30 women) for the study from the New York Metropolitan area and New Jersey. The subjects ranged in age from eighteen to sixty years old. Subjects were asked to be available for two sessions, each estimated to last about two hours. In the first meeting they were given the Rorschach test, and a battery of self-report measures and demographic questionnaires. This battery included The Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960), the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Empathy) (Davis, 1983), the Self-Report Altruism Scale (Rushton, 1981), and the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). The second session involved having all the subjects in a large lecture room at the same time.

"Understanding negotiators' cognitive processes requires attention to the demands of the task and social environment. In contract negotiations, disputants' interests ordinarily are fundamentally opposed. The structure of contract negotiation problems is determined by the joint distribution of negotiators' payoffs across all feasible settlements. Analyses demonstrate that the attractiveness of common settlements, such as those arrived at through issue-by-issue compromise or logrolling, and the solution preferred by various social welfare criteria, is largely dependent on problem structure. The outcome of negotiations also is influenced by negotiators' strategic appraisals of potential concessions during the negotiating process. Simulation analyses investigated several simple concessionary strategies. The individualistic strategy, which places no weight, either positive or negative, on the other negotiator's payoff performs well no matter what the structure of the problem or what the other's strategy. In certain problems, a self-interested negotiator can do slightly better by instrumentally placing either a positive or a negative weight on the other's payoff. The other's strategy has as much or more of an effect on a negotiator's payoff as the negotiator's own strategy. A Prisoner's Dilemma problem emerged in all investigated problem structures; pairs of negotiators who both used rules that place some positive weight on the other received higher joint payoffs than pairs who used the individualistic rule. Two critical aspects of negotiators' social environment are identified--the 'rules' that specify the others with whom a negotiator must interact and the mix of strategies used by the population.

Wins and losses were determined through the comparison of a play's outcome with the average outcome of the individual's neighbors. The results revealed qualitative differences between small and large groups.

interactions. Recent literature has shown that group size uncertainty
might change strategic cooperation behavior in significant ways. In this
paper, we investigate how conditional cooperation changes under group
size uncertainty in a linear public good game where the selfish rational
strategy is kept constant. Further, we suggest an underlying mechanism
that consists of beliefs and group size estimation. We show that
interpersonal differences (i.e., Social Value Orientation) are essential
in how this mechanism operates. More specifically, we find that
prosocials contribute more under uncertainty compared to certainty,
whereas proselfs do not change their behavior. Given the same feedback
proselfs estimated the group size to be bigger than prosocials,
resulting in a smaller contribution belief. These results imply that
interpersonal differences are important in explaining cooperation under
uncertainty compared to certainty.}"

identical incentives, low levels of cooperation (the `tragedy of the
commons' 2) are systematically more likely in maintenance than
provision. Across three series of experiments, we find that strong and
weak positive reciprocity, known to be fundamental tendencies
underpinning human cooperation(7-10), are substantially diminished under
maintenance compared with provision. As we show in a fourth experiment,
the opposite holds for negative reciprocity ('punishment'). Our findings

"{This study investigates the pattern of contribution decisions in a
network public goods game. In this game, each player's payoff depends
only on his own contribution and the contributions of his immediate
neighbors in a circle network. As in the standard public goods game, we
find substantial heterogeneity in behavior across subjects, including
both unconditional free-riding and full cooperation, as well as
conditional cooperation. We first examine the impact of different
information conditions on conditional cooperation. At the aggregate
level, we find that players who observe average payoff information about
others contribute significantly less than those who observe average
contribution information. We then investigate the extent to which
conditional cooperators facilitate the spread of cooperation and
free-riding behavior across the network. In groups with a single
free-rider type, we show that individual contributions decay faster for
players who are closer in the network to the free rider. On the other
hand, in groups with a single unconditional full contributor type,
players do not respond by converging to full cooperation. Instead, we
find that proximity to the unconditional full contributor seems only to
mitigate (or delay) the typical decline in contributions over time.
These contrasting effects are consistent with the widespread claim that
conditional cooperation is imperfect, or exhibits a self-serving bias.

"{Social norms can help to foster cooperation and to overcome the
free-rider problem in the private provision of public goods. This paper
focuses on the endogenous establishment of an average-oriented norm
which sanctions deviations from average public good contributions. In a
laboratory experiment, we analyse whether subjects are willing to
implement a punishment and reward scheme at their own expense by
applying the theory of non-governmental norm enforcement put forward by
Buchholz et al. (J Public Econ Theory 16(6):899-916, 2014). Based on
their theory, which omits a central authority but introduces an
endogenously determined enforcement mechanism, we implement a two-stage
public good game. In the first stage, subjects determine the strength of
the sanctioning mechanism on their own. In the second stage, they decide
on their personal contributions to the public good based on the
established mechanism. In line with comparable pool punishment
experiments, we find that subjects are apparently willing to contribute
funds in order to establish a norm enforcement mechanism. Groups
over-invest in the mechanism, but this over-investment decreases over
time. These investments seem to be driven by the subjects' previous
individual contributions and partly by a number of strategic
considerations, i.e. the previous average contribution made to the
public good lowers the investment in the sanctioning mechanism. In the
second stage of our experiment, higher norm enforcement parameters tend
to lead to higher public good contributions. The earnings with the

genetical selection. However, this hypothesis lacks direct experimental
testing, and the opposite prediction has also been made, that social
learning disfavours cooperation. We experimentally tested how different
aspects of social learning affect the level of cooperation in
public-goods games. We found that: (i) social information never
increased cooperation and usually led to decreased cooperation; (ii)
cooperation was lowest when individuals could observe how successful
individuals behaved; and (iii) cooperation declined because individuals
preferred to copy successful individuals, who cooperated less, rather
than copy common behaviours. Overall, these results suggest that
individuals use social information to try and improve their own success,

"{In social dilemma games, human participants often show conditional
cooperation (CC) behavior or its variant called moody conditional
cooperation (MCC), with which they basically tend to cooperate when many
other peers have previously cooperated. Recent computational studies

reinforcement learning. In the present study, we use a repeated
multiplayer prisoner's dilemma game and the repeated public goods game
played by human participants to examine whether MCC is observed across
different types of game and the possibility that reinforcement learning
explains observed behavior. We observed MCC behavior in both games, but
the MCC that we observed was different from that observed in the past
experiments. In the present study, whether or not a focal participant
cooperated previously affected the overall level of cooperation, instead
of changing the tendency of cooperation in response to cooperation of
other participants in the previous time step. We found that, across
different conditions, reinforcement learning models were approximately
as accurate as a MCC model in describing the experimental results.
Consistent with the previous computational studies, the present results

that public disclosure potentially drives pollution abatement and that
its eventual withdrawal does not obliterate abatement behaviour. We did
not observe conditional cooperation but average pollution declined over
time. Furthermore, individuals who thought it was unfair for Africa to
reduce emissions polluted more. We also found that pollution levels

method for exploring the motivation of participants when contributing to

chooses an independent contribution level as well as three adjusted
contribution levels when (s)he, as the only adjusting player, learns
that the other's independent contribution is smaller, equal or larger
than the own one. To approximate the border cases of simultaneous
contributing as well as sequential contributions we systematically vary
the probability that one player can adjust, based on such qualitative
information, but maintain that no adaptation at all and adaptation by
only one occurs with positive probability. Adaptation is framed in two
ways, once by additively changing the own independent contribution and
once by stating new contribution levels. Surprisingly, the framing
effect becomes stronger with experience. Reacting to coinciding
independent contributions implies impressive conformity in contributing.
Reacting to higher, respectively lower independent contributions implies
average upward, and, more strongly, downward adaptation. (C) 2016

"{The empirical research on the public goods game (PGG) indicates that
both institutional rewards and institutional punishment can curb
free-riding and that the punishment effect is stronger than the reward
effect. Self-regarding models that are based on Nash equilibrium (NE)
strategies or evolutionary game dynamics correctly predict which
incentives are best at promoting cooperation, but individuals do not
play these rational strategies overall. The goal of our study is to
investigate the dynamics of human decision making in the repeated PGG
with institutional incentives. We consider that an individual's
contribution is affected by four factors, which are self-interest, the
behavior of others, the reaction to rewards, and the reaction to
punishment. We find that people on average do not react to rewards and
punishment, and that self-interest and the behavior of others
sufficiently explain the dynamics of human behavior. Further analysis
suggests that institutional incentives promote cooperation by affecting
the self-regarding preference and that the other-regarding preference
seems to be independent of incentive schemes. Because individuals do not
change their behavioral patterns even if they were not rewarded or
punished, the mere potential to punish defectors and reward cooperators
can lead to considerable increases in the level of cooperation.}"

"{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to focus on conditional

experiments can be explained by differences in beliefs.
Design/methodology/approach - The author conducted linear public goods
experiments by using Partners and Strangers designs with belief
eliciting their group member's contributions.
Findings - The author shows that the difference in the magnitude of the
responsiveness of contribution to belief (i.e. the marginal contribution
to belief) creates different contribution levels in Partners and
Strangers designs.
Research limitations/implications - The presented results imply that
having a strategic motive increases contributions by increasing the
magnitude of the responsiveness of contribution to belief rather than by
raising belief level.
Originality/value - The main claim of this paper is that ``marginal

default and the possibility of acquiring information about a peer's
investment return (peer peeking) and of sanctioning a peer (peer
punishment). I observe loan repayment of over 90\% and punishment of
around 85\%. Punishment is classified as excessive compared to a
game-theoretically derived benchmark of zero punishment and a
behaviorally-rooted benchmark of unjust punishment. This gives solid
support to the anecdotal evidence and manifests the concern of excessive
peer pressure in microcredit group lending. The most promising
explanation is that borrowers have internalized the mission
indoctrination of the microlender of what constitutes a good borrower,
namely repaying loans and disciplining peers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

"{Norm violations can be contagious. Previous research analyzed two
mechanisms of why knowledge about others' norm violations triggers its
spread: (1) actors lower their subjective beliefs about the probability
or severity of punishment or (2) they condition their compliance on
others' compliance. While earlier field studies could hardly disentangle
both effects, we use a laboratory experiment which eliminates any
punishment threat. Subjects (n=466) can throw a die and are paid
according to their reported number. Our design rules out any possibility
of personal identification so that subjects can lie about their thrown
number and claim inflated payoffs without risking detection. The
aggregate distribution of reported payoffs allows the estimation of the
extent to which the honesty norm is violated. We compare two treatment
conditions in which subjects are informed about lying behavior of others
with a control condition without information feedback. Observations from
a subsequent die throw reveal that knowledge about liars triggers the
spread of lying compared to the control condition. Results from a
follow-up experiment show that this effect is moderated by subjects'
beliefs about the prevalence of norm violations of others. Our results
demonstrate the contagiousness of norm violations, where actors imitate
norm violations of others under the exclusion of strategic motives.}"
"{In a world in which many pressing global issues require large scale
cooperation, understanding the group size effect on cooperative behavior
is a topic of central importance. Yet, the nature of this effect remains
largely unknown, with lab experiments insisting that it is either
positive or negative or null, and field experiments suggesting that it
is instead curvilinear. Here we shed light on this apparent
contradiction by considering a novel class of public goods games
inspired to the realistic scenario in which the natural output limits of
the public good imply that the benefit of cooperation increases fast for
early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a large lab
experiment providing evidence that, in this case, group size has a
curvilinear effect on cooperation, according to which intermediate-size
groups cooperate more than smaller groups and more than larger groups.
In doing so, our findings help fill the gap between lab experiments and
field experiments and suggest concrete ways to promote large scale
cooperation among people.}"
"{We study games where voluntary contributions can be adjusted until a
steady state is reached. In consent games contributions start low and
can be increased; in dissent games contributions start high and can be
decreased. The equilibrium prediction is free riding in consent games
but as much as social efficiency in dissent games. We test it
experimentally and confirm that the dissent mechanism yields substantial
welfare improvements over the consent mechanism. With experience,
subjects contribute on average less than 30\% of the endowment in
consent games but more than 60\% in dissent games. Generally, subjects
match the lower of the opponents' contributions: they do not follow when
single opponents increase contributions in consent games, but follow
when single opponents decrease contributions in dissent games. This
asymmetry in the conditional cooperation is predicted by heterogeneity
of egoistic and inequity averse types, with individual types being
private information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Exclusion has long been employed as a common disciplinary measure
against defectors, both at work and in social life. In this paper, we
study the effect of excludability - exclusion of the lowest contributor
- on contributions in three different team production settings. We
demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that excludability
increases contributions. Excludability is particularly effective in
production settings where the average or maximum effort determines team
production. In these settings, we observe almost immediate convergence
to full contribution. In settings where the minimum effort determines
team production, excludability leads to a large increase in
contributions only if the value of the excluded individual's
contribution to the public good is redistributed among the included
individuals. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

"{The effect of sanctions on cooperation depends on social and cultural
norms. While free riding is kept at bay by altruistic punishment in
certain cultures, antisocial punishment carried out by free riders
pushes back cooperation in others. In this paper we analyze sanctions in
both a standard public goods game with a linear production function and
an otherwise identical social dilemma in which the minimum contribution
determines the group outcome. Experiments were run in a culture with
traditionally high antisocial punishment (Southern Europe). We replicate
the detrimental effect of antisocial sanctions on cooperation in the
linear case. However, we find that punishment is still widely effective
when actions are complementary: the provision of the public good
significantly and substantially increases with sanctions, participants
punish significantly less and sanctions radically transform conditional
cooperation patterns to generate significant welfare gains.}"
"{We experimentally investigate how different information about others'
individual contributions affects conditional cooperators' willingness to
cooperate in a one-shot linear public goods game. We find that when
information about individual contributions is provided, contributions
are generally higher than when only average information is available.
This effect is particularly strong when others' individual contributions
are relatively homogeneous. When both types of information are provided,
this effect is moderated. In the case of individual feedback we find the
willingness to contribute to be higher the lower the variation in
others' contributions, but with pronounced heterogeneity in individuals'
reactions. While the majority of conditional cooperators' are mainly
guided by others' average contributions, more people follow the,bad
example of a low contributor than the good example of a high
contributor. Overall, we provide evidence that information (and lack
thereof) about others' individual contributions affects conditional
cooperators' willingness to cooperate in systematic ways. (C) 2015

"{We propose a simple behavioral model to analyze situations where (1) a
group of agents repeatedly plays a public goods game within a network
structure and (2) each agent only observes the past behavior of her
neighbors, but is affected by the decisions of the whole group. The
model assumes that agents are imperfect conditional cooperators, that
they infer unobserved contributions assuming imperfect conditional
cooperation by others, and that they have some degree of bounded
rationality. We show that our model approximates quite accurately
regularities derived from public goods game experiments.}"
"{The current social dilemma literature lacks theoretical consensus
regarding how individuals behave when facing multiple simultaneous
social dilemmas. The divided-loyalty hypothesis, from organizational
theory, predicts that cooperation will decline as individuals experience
multiple social dilemmas with different compared to the same group
members. The conditional-cooperation hypothesis, from behavioral
economics, predicts that cooperation will increase as individuals
experience multiple social dilemmas with different compared to the same
group members. We employ a laboratory experiment to create consensus
between these literatures and find support for the
conditional-cooperation hypothesis. The positive effect of interacting
with different group members comes from participants having an
opportunity to shift their cooperative behavior from the less
cooperative to the more cooperative group.}"
"{Giving registered organ donors priority on organ waiting lists, as has
been implemented in Israel and Singapore, provides an incentive for
registration and has the potential to increase the pool of deceased
donor organs. However, the implementation of a priority rule might allow
for loopholes - as is the case in Israel - in which an individual can
register to receive priority but avoid ever being in a position to
donate organs. We experimentally investigate how such a loophole affects
donation and find that the majority of subjects use the loophole when
available. The existence of a loophole completely eliminates the
increase in donation generated by the priority rule. When information
about loophole use is made public, subjects respond to others' use of
the loophole by withholding donation such that the priority system with
a loophole generates fewer donations than an allocation system without
priority. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Some policy problems pit one group's interests against another's. One
group may determine provision of a project (such as a dam) that benefits
group members but hurts others. We introduce a model of such projects.
In-group members may contribute to a common fund that benefits them as a
public good. Benefits from the project may vary within the group.
Provision has negative downstream externalities: contributions hurt
agents outside the in-group ({''}Outsiders{''}), rendering them
anti-social. Many models of social preferences predict that such
externalities should reduce provision, although conditional cooperation
or a preference for in-group members may counteract this. We test this
model with a lab experiment using Outsiders with whom the in-group
members have more and less contact. With homogeneous in-group benefits,
the presence of negative downstream externalities reduces contributions
by half when they have closer contact with Outsiders but not at all when
they have had no contact. We introduce a rotating high-return position
that allows subjects to trade favors. In this setting, contributions of
non-privileged members diminish slightly when faced with the negative
externality given closer contact with Outsiders, and not at all with
less contact. Reciprocal giving occurs whether or not Outsiders are
present. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{A central assumption in economics is that people misreport their private
information if this is to their material benefit. Several recent models
depart from this assumption and posit that some people do not lie or at
least do not lie maximally. These models invoke many different
underlying motives including intrinsic lying costs, altruism, efficiency
concerns, or conditional cooperation. To provide an
empirically-validated microfoundation for these models, it is crucial to
understand the relevance of the different potential motives. We measure
the extent of lying costs among a representative sample of the German
population by calling them at home. In our setup, participants have a
clear monetary incentive to misreport, misreporting cannot be detected,
reputational concerns are negligible and altruism, efficiency concerns
or conditional cooperation cannot play a role. Yet, we find that
aggregate reporting behavior is close to the expected truthful
distribution suggesting that lying costs are large and widespread.
Further lab experiments show that this result is not driven by the mode
of communication. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This

"{This paper reports experimental evidence on the voluntary formation of
coalitions to provide a public good. Participation and commitment in a
coalition are either exogenously imposed or endogenously determined by
the players themselves. We find larger voluntary participation rates
when commitments in the coalition are endogenously determined using a
minimum contribution rule rather than exogenously determined. However,
due to a trade-off between participation and commitment, coalitions with
voluntary participation are less effective in facilitating cooperation
compared to when all players are forced to participate. This paper
therefore confirms the rather pessimistic conclusions from coalition
formation theories.}"
"{This paper introduces new experimental designs to examine how
conditional cooperation and punishment behaviours respond to the full
range of variation in the contributions of others. It is shown that
contributions become significantly more selfish-biased as others
contribute more unequally, while punishment increases both with
decreasing contributions by the target player and increasing
contributions by a third player. Low contributors who punish
antisocially do not direct their punishment specifically toward high
contributors, while their beliefs indicate that they expect to
themselves be punished.}"
"{It is widely believed that international cooperation can arise through
strategies of reciprocity. In this paper, we investigate whether
citizens in the United States and 25 other countries support reciprocity
to deal with climate change. We find little public enthusiasm for
intrinsic reciprocity, in which countries restrain their consumption of
fossil fuels if and only if other countries do the same. In contrast, we
find significant support for extrinsic reciprocity, in which countries
enforce cooperation by linking issues. Citizens support economic
sanctions against polluters and are willing to shame them in
international forums, especially when the polluters are violating a
treaty. Cooperation could, therefore, emerge from efforts to link
climate with other issues and to embed climate commitments in
international law.}"
"{Broken windows: the metaphor has changed New York and Los Angeles. Yet
it is far from undisputed whether the broken windows policy was causal
for reducing crime. The scope of the theory is not confined to crime.
The theory claims that crime is inextricably linked to social order more
generally. In a series of lab experiments we put two components of this
more general theory to the test. We show that first impressions and
early punishment of antisocial behaviour are independently and jointly
causal for cooperativeness. The effect of good first impressions and of
early vigilance cannot be explained with, but adds to, participants'
initial level of benevolence. Mere impression management is not strong
enough to maintain cooperation. Cooperation stabilizes if good first
impressions are combined with some risk of sanctions. Yet if we control
for first impressions, early vigilance only has a small effect. The
effect vanishes over time. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{We investigate voluntary contribution to public goods in culturally
heterogeneous groups with a laboratory experiment conducted among 432
Hindu and Muslim subjects in India. With our specification of `Leading
by example' we test for an interaction effect between leadership and
religious heterogeneity in a high stake environment. While cultural
diversity does not affect contributions in the standard linear Public
Goods Game, it reduces cooperation in the presence of a leader.
Furthermore, we show that preferences for conditional cooperation are
only prevalent in pure groups. In mixed groups, poor leadership and
uncertainty about followers' reciprocity hinders the functionality of
leadership as an institutional device to resolve social dilemmas. (C)

"{We use the strategy method to classify subjects into cooperator types in
a large-scale online Public Goods Game and find that free riders spend
more time on making their decisions than conditional cooperators and
other cooperator types. This result is robust to reversing the framing

natural swiftness in responding. Our results suggest that conditional
cooperation serves as a norm and that free riders need time to resolve a

"{Allowing resource users to communicate in behavioural experiments on
commons dilemmas increases the level of cooperation. In actual common
pool resource dilemmas in the real world, communication is costly, which
is an important detail missing from most typical experiments. We
conducted experiments where participants must give up harvesting
opportunities to communicate. The constrained communication treatment is
compared with the effect of limited information about the state of the
resource and the actions of the other participants. We find that despite
making communication costly, performance of groups improves in all
treatments with communication. We also find that constraining
communication has a more significant effect than limiting information on
the performance of groups.}"
"{We study experimentally voluntary contributions to public goods when
none, some, or all previous decisions are observable. When agents
observe previous moves, they tend to condition their cooperation on
observed cooperation. This leads to two effects of increased
transparency: on the one hand, early movers are more likely to cooperate
in order to encourage those who observe them to cooperate. On the other
hand, as transparency increases, later movers are less likely to
cooperate because they are more likely to observe defections and defect
in response. With increasing returns to scale, where the effect of one
agent's contribution is larger as more agents contribute, an information
chain is as effective in inducing cooperation as full transparency. In a
linear public good, where agents lose in monetary terms by contributing
to the public good, information chains induce higher cooperation in
early movers compared to a no-transparency treatment and in late movers
compared to a full-transparency treatment Thus, partial information can
be used to balance the positive and negative effects of transparency.

"{When individuals invest in a common good, an efficient outcome is hard
to achieve, because each can free ride on others' efforts. This problem
can lead parents that raise their young together to reduce their
investment in care, with negative consequences for offspring. Here, we
present a mathematical model to show that a strategy of conditional
cooperation, in which parents take turns feeding their young, can help
to resolve this problem. To test this idea, we studied the behavior of
great tit parents raising chicks together. We found that parents
alternated visits to the nest more than would be expected by chance,
speeding up their feeding rate after their partner had visited the
chicks, but slowing down again once they had visited in turn. This
effect was not mediated by visit-to-visit changes in offspring begging
intensity, although females (but not males) were influenced by mean
begging levels across broods. We conclude that conflict over parental
investment in this species is partly ameliorated by a simple form of
reciprocity.}"
"{Punishments and rewards are effective means for establishing cooperation
in social dilemmas. We compare a setting where actors individually
decide whom to sanction with a setting where sanctions are only
implemented when actors collectively agree that a certain actor should
be sanctioned. Collective sanctioning decisions are problematic due to
the difficulty of reaching consensus. However, when a decision is made
collectively, perverse sanctioning ( e. g. punishing high contributors)
by individual actors is ruled out. Therefore, collective sanctioning
decisions are likely to be in the interest of the whole group. We employ
a laboratory experiment where subjects play Public Goods Games with
opportunities for punishment or reward that is implemented either by an
individual, a majority, or unanimously. For both punishment and reward,
contribution levels are higher in the individual than the majority
condition, and higher under majority than unanimity. Often, majority
agreement or unanimity was not reached on punishments or rewards.}"
"{We use a limited information environment to assess the role of confusion
in the repeated voluntary contributions game. A comparison with play in
a standard version of the game suggests, that the common claim that
decision errors due to confused subjects biases estimates of cooperation
upwards, is not necessarily correct. Furthermore, we find that simple
learning cannot generate the kind of contribution dynamics commonly
attributed to the existence of conditional cooperators. We conclude that
cooperative behavior and its decay observed in public goods games is not
a pure artefact of confusion and learning.}"
"{Research in many societies shows that ethnic diversity correlates with a
decline in cooperation at the community level. This literature neglects
cases in which ethnic heterogeneity is hierarchically structured. Power
and status differences between ethnic groups, or ethnic dominance, may
play an important role in determining cooperative outcomes. We test this
hypothesis using public goods experiments with caste groups in India in
which we manipulate the caste composition of experimental groups.
Conservative estimates show that ethnic dominance between high and low
ranking castes has a much larger negative effect on contributions in the
public goods experiment than does caste diversity. We argue that ethnic
dominance interactions such as ethnic discrimination constitute a type
of antisocial punishment between groups. We also find that conditional
cooperation is limited to within ethnic groups, revealing ethnocentric
cooperation preferences. These results confirm the importance of group
structure in human cooperative patterns, and help bridge the gap between
evolutionary theory and cooperation dynamics in multi-ethnic real world
settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{We use instrumental variables for estimating the causal effect of
beliefs on contributions in repeated public good games. The effect is
about half as large as suggested by ordinary least squares. Thus, we
present evidence that beliefs have a causal effect on contributions, but
also that beliefs are endogenous. We compare the causal, belief-based
model of contributions to alternative models based on matching the
previous contributions of others and responding to one's deviation from
the average in the previous round. The causal, belief-based model
performs well, indicating that beliefs have a central role in
determining contributions.}"
"{The paper reports an experimental study on a promotion-demotion
mechanism to mitigate the free-rider problem in a voluntary contribution
setting. The mechanism hierarchically splits a group in two; we refer to
one subgroup as the Major league and to the other as the minor league.
The most cooperative subject of the minor league is switched with the
least cooperative subject in the Major league. The results reveal a
significant increase of cooperation levels in both leagues relative to
the standard voluntary contribution mechanism. We argue that a lack of
sequentially-rational beliefs about continuation payoffs in Major and
minor leagues leads to higher equilibrium contributions. The data
suggest beyond that, the promotion-demotion mechanism regroups subjects
deliberately according to their cooperativeness.}"
"{We examine the impact of one-time threats of expulsion and punishment on
voluntary contributions in a public goods game. Participants played in
15-round sessions where they were allowed to vote to remove other
subjects only after round 5 and in one design also voted whether to
punish the remaining subjects after round 10. Consistent with the
literature, we find that an additional threat of punishment increases
the contributions of participants before the punishment vote. The
literature shows that frequent threats of expulsion may increase
efficiency in the provision of public goods. In realistic settings,
however, opportunities for expulsion are limited whereas threats of
non-expulsive punishments are common. We find the threat of costly
punishment increases contributions with little impact on efficiency
(57.1\% versus 58.1\%), and that standards for inclusion rise when later
punishment is available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{This paper studies whether prosocial values are transmitted from parents
to their children. We do so through an economic experiment in which
children and their parents play a standard public goods game. The
experimental data presents us with a surprising result. While we find
significant heterogeneity in cooperative preferences in both parents and
children, we cannot reject the null that the correlation between the
degree of cooperation of a child and that of his or her parent is zero.
That is, there is lack of evidence in our data that prosocial values are
transmitted from parents to children. This finding is robust to the
inclusion of demographic and socio-economic controls. Finally, parents
show a significant degree of conditional cooperation, thus confirming
the results of the existing experimental literature; such conditional
cooperation is however absent in children. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

"{We compare social preference and social norm-based explanations for peer
effects in a three-person gift exchange experiment. In the experiment a
principal pays a wage to each of two agents, who then make effort
choices sequentially. In our baseline treatment we observe that the
second agent's effort is influenced by the effort choice of the first
agent, even though there are no material spillovers between agents. This
peer effect is predicted by the Fehr-Schmidt (1999) model of social
preferences. As we show from a norms elicitation experiment, it is also
consistent with social norms compliance. A conditional logit
investigation of the explanatory power of payoff inequality and elicited
norms finds that the second agent's effort is best explained by the
social preferences model. In further experiments we find that the peer
effects change as predicted by the social preferences model. Again, a
conditional logit analysis favors an explanation based on social
preferences, rather than social norms. Our results suggest that, in our
context, the social preferences model provides a parsimonious
explanation for the observed peer effect.}"
"{This paper provides a novel tax behavior explanation for investor home
bias. Specifically, we show that investors are reluctant to hold foreign
equity with a tax levied by a foreign tax collector. Starting point is
the observation that willingness to pay taxes depends on the attributes
of the tax collecting country. This relationship indicates a form of
country-specific tax behavior: taxpayers respond to country attributes
as they indicate cooperative and trustworthy behavior of tax
authorities, the government or other taxpayers. We conduct a laboratory
investment experiment to explore the effect of sentiment towards
different tax collectors, specifically of the view on home country
taxation relative to foreign country taxation. The results suggest that
investors prefer domestic equity and invest in riskier portfolios in
case of a foreign tax rather than a domestic tax on foreign dividend
income. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Are people more likely to infringe on a legal obligation if they
perceive it as unfair? This question is especially relevant in
situations with low potential punishment for disobeying an obligation,
i.e., with expressive law. To explore this issue, we present
experimental evidence on how expressive law affects behavior if the law
defines asymmetric obligations for ex ante identical individuals. To
implement expressive law we introduce very weakly incentivized
obligations, i.e., minimum contribution levels, in a repeated public
goods experiment. Our main finding is that, in an environment with
asymmetric obligations, people adhere to their individual obligation to
the same extent as in an environment with symmetric obligations. This
result is compatible with the argument that expressive law affects
behavior by attaching an emotional cost of disobeying the own obligation
such as a loss in self-esteem. We only find a significant temporary
effect of obligations that vanishes in the long run. (C) 2013 Elsevier

full liability; nevertheless, the difference is much smaller than
predicted by theory. In the safety net game, subjects behave as if
socially responsible for the losses they impose on the group. With
repetition, nevertheless, a gradual emergence of the moral hazard

subject is simultaneously a member of two randomly assigned and
identical groups where only members (neighbors) are different. We study
behavior in a coordination game with multiple equilibria and a public
goods game, which has only one equilibrium in material payoffs. We speak
of social interactions if the same subject at the same time makes
group-specific decisions that depend on their respective neighbors'

interaction effects both when the game has multiple equilibria in
material payoffs and when it only has one equilibrium. (JEL C91, H41,

"{The structure and dynamics of ecosystems can affect the information

most participants in commons dilemmas can be classified as conditional
cooperators, not having full information about the actions of others may
affect their decisions. When participants had more information about
others, there was a more rapid reduction of the resource in the first
round of the experiment. When communication was allowed, limiting the
information available made it harder to develop effective institutional
arrangements. When communication was not allowed, there was a more rapid
decline of performance in groups where information was limited. In sum,
the results suggest that making information available to others can have
an important impact on the conditional cooperation and the effectiveness

"{Fund raising appeals often announce that some funds have already been

high) in fundraising appeals across different targets (i.e., prospects,
low fidelity donors, and high fidelity donors). Based on a 2 x 3 x 3
between-subjects design we investigate charitable behavior of 25,617
households. Findings reveal a novel qualification of using seed
contributions as well as the necessity of a communication
differentiation by considering past behavior. We show that seed money
works well if the threshold is high but with a low threshold it could
have a baleful influence. More specifically, in campaigns targeted at
prospects and low fidelity donors, the announcement of seed money
increases donations regardless of the threshold level. However, in
campaigns targeted at high fidelity donors, seed money is an effective
strategy only when the threshold is rather high. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

the individual's cooperativeness and the individual's beliefs about the

consensus effect: cooperative leaders are more optimistic than
noncooperators about the cooperativeness of followers. However,
cooperative leaders contribute more than noncooperative leaders even
after controlling for optimism. We conclude that differing leader
contributions by differing types of leader in large part reflects social
motivations. (JEL A13, C92, D03)}"
"{Human cooperation in large groups and between non-kin individuals
remains a Darwinian puzzle. Investigations into whether and how sexual
selection is involved in the evolution of cooperation represent a new

public-good game in the presence of out-group observers, either of the
same sex or of the opposite sex. At the end of the game, participants
could donate part of their gain to the village school in the presence of
the same observers. Both contributions to the public good and donations
to the school, which reflect different components of cooperativeness,

cooperation within these two third-world communities. We find that
standard survey measures of trust employed by the World Values Survey,
which form the basis of most macro-empirical investigations of trust and
political-economic development, are not useful for predicting
contributions to a public goods game. Expectations, on the other hand,
profoundly influence contributions and do so independently of trust
levels. However, this influence is complex and depends on the
distribution of player types. We observe a distribution similar to
previous studies, with the largest group, principled reciprocators,
updating their behavior quickly based on expectations of
trustworthiness. Indeed, this study suggests that trustworthiness in
particular is more important than trust in general and further
challenges `a-rational' theories of trust.}"
"{Behavioral hypotheses have recently been introduced into public-choice
theory (Ostrom in American Political Science Review 92:1-22, 1998).
Nevertheless, the individual intrinsic preferences which drive decisions
in social dilemmas have not yet been empirically identified. This paper
asks whether risk and inequity preferences are behind agents' behavior
in a sequential public good game. The experimental results show that
risk aversion is negatively correlated with the contribution decision of
first movers. Second movers who are averse to advantageous inequity
free-ride less and reciprocate more than do others. Our results
emphasize the importance of strategic uncertainty for the correct
understanding of which preferences influence cooperation in social
dilemmas.}"
"{The article analyses experimental ``solidarity games{''} with two
benefactors and one beneficiary. Depending on their motive for
giving-e.g., warm glow, altruism, or guilt-the benefactors' response
functions are either constant, decreasing, or increasing. If motives
interact, or if envy is a concern, then more complex (unimodal) shapes
may emerge. Controlling for random utility perturbations, we determine
which and how many motives affect individual decision making. The main
findings are that the motives of about 75\% of the subjects can be
identified fairly sharply, that all of the motives discussed in the
literature co-exist in the population, and that for any given individual
no more than two motives (out of six motives considered overall) are
identified. We conclude that a unifying motive for solidarity cannot be
derived even when we allow for individually heterogeneous
parameterization: different subjects give for different reasons and all
existing social preference theories are partially correct.}"
"{A core element of economic theory is the assumption of stable
preferences. We test this assumption in public goods games by repeatedly
eliciting cooperation preferences in a fixed subject pool over a period
of five months. We find that cooperation preferences are very stable at
the aggregate level, and, to a smaller degree, at the individual level,
allowing us to predict future behavior fairly accurately. Furthermore,
our results provide evidence on the psychological foundations of
cooperation preferences. The personality dimension `Agreeableness' is
closely related to both the type and the stability of cooperation
preferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Empirical evidence suggests that the propensity to cooperate in common
pool resource dilemmas is higher for small, homogeneous groups with
efficacious monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms. Given that transition
from socialist to market economies is associated with larger, more
heterogeneous groups with diluted opportunities for monitoring and
sanctioning, individuals in later-stage transition economies may be
expected to be less cooperative than their early-stage counterparts.
However, evidence from experiments conducted with subjects in two
economies at different stages of transition suggests that this may not
be the case. These findings have implications for both theorists and
practitioners alike.}"
"{The provision of public goods regularly embodies interrelated spheres of
influence on multiple scales. This article examines the nature of human
behavior in a multilevel social dilemma game with positive provision
externalities to local and global scales. We report experimental results
showing that behavior in multilevel games is strongly driven by
asymmetric conditional cooperation prioritizing local level
externalities. Our findings demonstrate how individuals over time adjust
their behavior to local conditions. We do not find significant
adjustment to global group average, suggesting that the local group
creates a salient reference group for social comparisons in multilevel
public goods provision. Our results emphasize the importance of strong
local level commitment when designing institutions to promote
sustainable provision of globally important public goods like the global
climate.}"
"{In recent years, significant advances have been made in understanding
the adaptive (ultimate) and mechanistic (proximate) explanations for the
evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Studies of cooperative
behaviour in humans invariably use economic games. These games have
provided important insights into the mechanisms that maintain economic
and social cooperation in our species. However, they usually rely on the
division of monetary tokens which are given to participants by the
investigator. The extent to which behaviour in such games may reflect
behaviour in the real world of biological markets - where money must be
earned and behavioural strategies incur real costs and benefits - is
unclear. To provide new data on the potential scale of this problem, we
investigated whether people behaved differently in two standard economic
games (public goods game and dictator game) when they had to earn their
monetary endowments through the completion of dull or physically
demanding tasks, as compared with simply being given the endowment. The
requirement for endowments to be `earned' through labour did not affect
behaviour in the dictator game. However, the requirement to complete a
dull task reduced cooperation in the public goods game among the subset
of participants who were not familiar with game theory. There has been
some effort to test whether the conclusions drawn from standard,
token-based cooperation games adequately reflect cooperative behaviour
`in the wild.' However, given the almost total reliance on such games to
study cooperation, more exploration of this issue would be welcome. Our
data are not unduly worrying, but they do suggest that further
exploration is needed if we are to make general inferences about human
behaviour from the results of structured economic games.}"
"{This paper shows moral decision making is not well predicted by the
overall fairness of an act but rather by the fairness of the
consequences that follow directly. In laboratory experiments,
third-party punishment for keeping money from a poorer player decreases
when an intermediary actor is included in the transaction. This is true
for completely passive intermediaries, even though intermediation
decreases the payout of the poorest player and hurts equity, and because
intermediation distances the transgressor from the outcome. A separate
study shows rewards of charitable giving decrease when the saliency of
an intermediary is increased. (JEL A13, D63, D64)}"
"{The aim of this paper is to understand the crucial role of Social
Psychology in economic analysis. Firstly, we present the scientific
domain related to Social Psychology, as well as its methods, preferred
topics and analytical tools. Secondly, we analyze how the introduction
of social psychology interpersonal concepts (cognitive dissonance,
heuristics, diffusion of responsibility, fundamental attribution error,
magical thinking, false consensus bias, belief in a just world) into
economic analysis can improve pure rational decision theory. Thirdly, we
focus on the fundamental role of social influence (conformism,
leadership), group formation (identity, discrimination) and social ties
(family, friends), on individual and collective economic decisions. Our
review shows that collaboration between economists and social
psychologists can lead to new experimental results and can substantially
improve economic behavioural models. Cooperation between the two
disciplines thus leads to new useful political tools (framing,
persuasion and social norms) which can be useful for public
decision-makers.}"
"{How effectively do democratic institutions provide public goods? Despite
the incentives an elected leader has to free ride or impose majority
tyranny, our experiment demonstrates that electoral delegation results
in full provision of the public good. Analysis of the experimental data
suggests that the result is primarily due to electoral selection: groups
elect prosocial leaders and replace those who do not implement full
contribution outcomes. However, we also observe outcomes in which a
minimum winning coalition exploits the contributions of the remaining
players. A second experiment demonstrates that when electoral delegation
must be endogenously implemented, individuals voluntarily cede authority
to an elected agent only when preplay communication is permitted. Our
combined results demonstrate that democratic delegation helps groups
overcome the free-rider problem and generally leads to outcomes that are
often both efficient and equitable.}"
"{This paper examines how group composition affects conditional
cooperation in public good games. Identity was created using a
team-building activity and subjects were assigned to groups of six with
varying proportions of subjects from two teams. Majority members
contributed more to the public good than minority members. However,
contributions were mainly related to beliefs about the contributions of
others, especially others from the same teams, rather than
minority/majority status. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{In the context of social dilemmas, previous research has shown that
human cooperation is mainly based on the social norm of conditional
cooperation. While in most cases individuals behave according to such a
norm, deviant behavior is no exception. Recent research further suggests
that heterogeneity in social behavior might be associated with varying
genetic predispositions. In this study, we investigated the relationship
between individuals' behavior in a public goods experiment and the
promoter-region functional repeat polymorphism in the monoamine oxidase
A gene (MAOA). In a dynamic setting of increasing information about
others' contributions, we analyzed differences in two main components of
conditional cooperation, namely the players' own contribution and their
beliefs regarding the contribution of other players. We showed that
there is a significant association between individuals' behavior in a
repeated public goods game and MAOA. Our results suggest that male
carriers of the low activity alleles cooperate significantly less than
those carrying the high activity alleles given a situation where
subjects had to rely on their innate beliefs about others'
contributions. With increasing information about the others'
cooperativeness, the genetic effect diminishes. Furthermore, significant
opposing effects for female subjects carrying two low activity alleles
were observed.}"
"{Cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals is a fundamental
aspect of society, but it has been a longstanding puzzle in biological
and social sciences. Recently, theoretical studies in biology and
economics showed that conditional cooperation-cooperating only with
those who have exhibited cooperative behavior-can spread over a society.
Furthermore, experimental studies in psychology demonstrated that people
are actually conditional cooperators. In this study, we used functional
magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural system underlying
conditional cooperation by scanning participants during interaction with
cooperative, neutral and non-cooperative opponents in prisoner's dilemma
games. The results showed that: (i) participants cooperated more
frequently with both cooperative and neutral opponents than with
non-cooperative opponents; and (ii) a brain area related to cognitive
inhibition of pre-potent responses (right dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex) showed greater activation, especially when participants
confronted non-cooperative opponents. Consequently, we suggest that
cognitive inhibition of the motivation to cooperate with non-cooperators
drives the conditional behavior.}"
"{One commonly used strategy in charitable fundraising is sharing names
and contact information of donors between organizations, even those
whose missions are unrelated. The efficacy of this practice hinges on
the existence of ``giving types,{''} that is, a positive correlation at
the individual level between giving to one organization and to another.
We run an experiment using a non-student sample (an artifactual field
experiment) in which participants have the opportunity to donate to
multiple charitable organizations. We examine the relationship between
giving to one organization and giving to another. Our results support
the existence of a giving type; a factor analysis demonstrates that
giving decisions are driven by a single (unique) factor, and individuals
who give to one organization, give significantly more to other
organizations than do non-donors. Our results have important
implications for the economics of charity and for fundraising practice.

standard assumptions, a latent-class mixed logit specification with
three sub-populations is shown to capture well heterogeneity in
individual contribution levels over time, while also accomodating for

"{Recent evidence suggests that prosocial behaviors like conditional
cooperation and costly norm enforcement can stabilize large-scale
cooperation for commons management. However, field evidence on the
extent to which variation in these behaviors among actual commons users
accounts for natural commons outcomes is altogether missing. Here, we
combine experimental measures of conditional cooperation and survey
measures on costly monitoring among 49 forest user groups in Ethiopia
with measures of natural forest commons outcomes to show that (i) groups
vary in conditional cooperator share, (ii) groups with larger
conditional cooperator share are more successful in forest commons
management, and (iii) costly monitoring is a key instrument with which
conditional cooperators enforce cooperation. Our findings are consistent
with models of gene-culture coevolution on human cooperation and provide
external validity to laboratory experiments on social dilemmas.}"
"{Does the cultural background influence the success with which
genetically unrelated individuals cooperate in social dilemma
situations? In this paper, we provide an answer by analysing the data of
Herrmann et al. (2008a), who studied cooperation and punishment in 16
subject pools from six different world cultures (as classified by
Inglehart \& Baker (2000)). We use analysis of variance to disentangle
the importance of cultural background relative to individual
heterogeneity and group-level differences in cooperation. We find that
culture has a substantial influence on the extent of cooperation, in
addition to individual heterogeneity and group-level differences
identified by previous research. The significance of this result is that
cultural background has a substantial influence on cooperation in
otherwise identical environments. This is particularly true in the
presence of punishment opportunities.}"
"{Belief elicitation is an important methodological issue for experimental
economists. There are two generic questions: 1) Do incentives increase
belief accuracy? 2) Are there interaction effects of beliefs and
decisions? We investigate these questions in the case of finitely
repeated public goods experiments. We find that belief accuracy is
significantly higher when beliefs are incentivized. The relationship
between contributions and beliefs is slightly steeper under incentives.
However, we find that incentivized beliefs tend to lead to higher
contribution levels than either non-incentivized beliefs or no beliefs
at all. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of
public good experiments.}"
"{Theoretical models suggest that social networks influence the evolution
of cooperation, but to date there have been few experimental studies.
Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread
in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to
befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal
inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that
originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain
cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a
sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public
goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of
interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors
spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an
ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment,
focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution
behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a
party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists
for multiple periods and spreads upto three degrees of separation(from
person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each
additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first
period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects
who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a
consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior
cascades in human social networks.}"
"{Economists use public goods experiments to develop and test theories of
individual preferences and institutional design. Previous work
demonstrates many participants in public goods experiments contribute to
the public good out of confusion. We design experiments to provide
insights on the consequences and causes of confusion. We establish that
confusion amounts to more than statistical noise and does not dissipate
with repetition (i.e. learning). Confused subjects use experimental
parameters and the behavior of other players as cues, which confounds
treatment effects and traditional strategies to identify other-regarding
preferences through exogenous parameter changes and the modeling of
reactions to other subjects' decisions. We argue that confusion stems
from an inaccurate understanding of game incentives ({''}failure of game
form recognition{''}), which is a consequence of the framing and
inadequate payoff information in standard instructions. Modified
instructions can substantially reduce confusion, and, in turn, change
the distribution of contributions to the public good.}"
"{We study the effect of social information on the voluntary provision of
public goods. Competing theories predict that others' contributions
might be either substitutes or complements to one's own. We demonstrate
a positive social information effect on individual contributions,
supporting theories of complementarities. We find the most influential
level of social information is drawn from the 90th to 95th percentile of
previous contributions. We furthermore find the effect to be significant
for new members but not for renewing members. In the most effective
condition, social information increases contributions by 12\% (\$13).
These increased contributions do not crowd out future contributions.}"

"{This study examines the effects of ingroup favoritism and outgroup
hostility ({''}parochialism{''}), as well as of conditionally
cooperative strategies, in explaining contributions to experimental
public goods games. The experimental conditions vary group composition
along two culturally inheritable traits (political party preference and
religious affiliation) and one trivial, ``minimal{''} trait (birth
season). We contrast ingroup, outgroup, and random group conditions and
investigate the relation between the own contribution to the public good
and the expectations about other group members' behavior in each one of
them. We find evidence for ingroup favoritism but no support for a
separate tendency towards outgroup hostility. Further, conditional
cooperation and ingroup bias are, to some extent, linked. Subjects had
higher expectations of the contributions of ingroup members, and their
own behavior was more strongly conditioned on other group members'
expected behavior in the ingroup conditions. In ingroup contexts,
subjects displayed a form of ``strong reciprocity{''} by giving more
than they expected others to at high expectation levels but less at low
expectation levels. Once these interactions are taken into account, we
do not find a direct effect of ingroup bias anymore. We discuss these
results in the light of theories of cultural group selection and
conclude that too much emphasis may have been laid on direct intergroup
conflict. Our results suggest that differential cooperativeness, rather
than parochialism, may characterize the behavior of individuals in
cultural ingroups and outgroups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

that the distribution of types is very similar across the four

subject pool. However, the distribution of the other types differs from
the one found in Switzerland.}"

"{Human cooperation in a large group of genetically unrelated people is an
evolutionary puzzle. Despite its costly nature, cooperative behavior is
commonly found in all human societies-a fact that has interested
researchers from a wide range of disciplines, including biology,
economics, and psychology, to name a few. Many behavioral experiments
have demonstrated that cooperation within a group can be sustained when
free riders are punished. We argue that punishment has both a direct
effect and an indirect effect on promoting cooperation. The direct
effect of punishment alters the consequences of cooperation and
defection in such a way as to make a rational person prefer cooperation.
The indirect effect of punishment promotes cooperation among conditional
cooperators by providing the condition necessary for their cooperation
(i.e., the expectation that other members will also cooperate). Here we
present data from two one-shot n-person prisoner's dilemma games,
demonstrating that the indirect effect of punishment complements the
direct effect to increase cooperation in the game. Furthermore, we show
that direct and indirect effects are robust across two forms of
punishment technology: either when punishment is voluntarily provided by
game players themselves or when it is exogenously provided by the
experimenter. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"

contributions. The latter treatment increases the frequency with which
cooperative subjects interact. We trace the familiar decay in public

"{In many species, territorial neighbours fight to establish their mutual
border and then develop a truce, known as the dear-enemy phenomenon,
characterized by reduced vigilance and aggression along the border. We
present evidence that among male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius
phoeniceus) the dear-enemy relationship is a form of reciprocal
conditional cooperation that is stabilized, at least in part, by
retaliation against cheaters. Simulated intrusions by randomly chosen
neighbours were punished by a targeted increase in vigilance and
aggression that persists for days. We interpret this increase in
vigilance towards trespassers as a manifestation of distrust. The
conditional decrease in vigilance and aggression is tempered by each
neighbour's probability of cuckolding the focal male. Male red-winged
blackbirds maintained greater vigilance and aggression towards sexually
attractive neighbours that were more successful at extra-pair
fertilizations (EPFs). It is unlikely that males directly observed
neighbours copulating with their mates. They were more likely to assess
a neighbour's ability to achieve extra-pair copulations using surrogate
cues that correlate with success at EPFs, including body size. Our
results suggest that red-winged blackbirds use rules that incorporate
their neighbour's behaviour and quality in their territorial
interactions with one another. Our results expand our understanding of
cooperation for animals and for humans as well.}"

"{We address two related issues. First, we analyze the effects of risk
preferences on cooperation in social dilemmas. Second, we compare social
dilemmas in which outcomes represent gains with dilemmas where outcomes
represent losses. Pie show that predictions on gain-loss asymmetries
with respect to conditions for cooperation crucially depend on
assumptions concerning risk preferences. Under the assumption of risk
aversion for gains as well as losses together with an assumption of
decreasing absolute risk aversion, conditions for cooperation are less
restrictive if outcomes represent losses than if outcomes represent
gains. Conversely - and counterintuitively - under the assumption of
S-shaped utility, conditions for cooperation are more restrictive if
outcomes represent losses than if outcomes represent gains. We provide
an experimental test of such predictions. Only a minority of subjects
behaves consistent with the assumption of S-shaped utility. Furthermore,
we find no empirical evidence for a general difference between
cooperation in social dilemmas in which outcomes represent gains and
dilemmas where outcomes represent losses. We do find evidence that risk
preferences affect cooperation rates.}"
"{It is well documented that people are reluctant to switch from a default

automatic-participation and no-participation default options on
subjects' participation in a public goods provision and their
contributions. Two variants of public goods game are employed: the
linear and the threshold public goods games. The study shows the
evidence of partial stickiness rather than complete stickiness of
default options as indicated in empirical studies. Our experimental
results square with the evidence of behavioral inertia only when the
automatic-participation default is used. This default boosts
contributions in the linear public goods game but not in the threshold
public goods game. The evidence of partial stickiness is robust to the
variation of the game employed, but the effect on contribution is
sensitive to it.}"
"{The restart effect occurs in linear voluntary contribution mechanism
(VCM) experiments when there is an upward pulse in contributions to the

regularity little research has been conducted regarding its causes.
However, other scholars have noted that some kind of revision takes
place during the stoppage that promotes cooperation. This research
posits that certain common knowledge about when the stoppage occurs
creates a ``coordination moment{''} where group members simultaneously
engage in revision and attempt to re-coordinate on a higher contribution
level. Following Schelling's description that such coordination comes
from focal points that are both ``prominent and conspicuous{''} I design
a VCM experiment that reproduces the standard restart result and then
compares those sessions to sessions where the exact pattern of stoppages

"{This paper compares different forms of leadership in their ability to
improve cooperation in a public goods experiment. Leaders either
contribute before the others (leading by example) or make a non-binding
pledge before all players contribute simultaneously (leading by words).
The exogenously imposed leadership is then compared to an endogenous
setting where players can choose if and how they want to lead. The
results show that in both settings leading by example has significant
positive effects on cooperation while leading by words only has small
effects as compared to situations without leadership. However, only few
subjects choose to lead by example when they have the choice. The
majority choose to lead by words or do not want to lead at all. The
results also show that leading by example is associated with an
institutional effect (players increase their contributions when they
have to lead by example) and a selection effect (players who choose to
lead by example are particularly cooperative).}"

(iii) contributions remain at the same level after an unexpected

"{In this article, we compare the causes and effects of immaterial rewards
and sanctions on cooperation in a voluntary contribution experiment. It
appears that both rewards and sanctions increase contributions (and that
rewards are more effective than sanctions) only when subjects interact
repeatedly within the same group. The effect is, however, insignificant,
which could be due to the higher variance in presence of rewards and
sanctions. Furthermore, it is evidenced that rewards have some negative
effect on the future contribution for both the imposer and the imposed
when the partner matching is applied, but both rewards and sanctions
have mainly positive effects under the stranger matching. Thus it seems
that the recipient of the feedback takes the message as a reliable
external evaluation of her contribution only under the stranger matching
protocol when the strategic use of feedback can largely be excluded.

opportunity to praise or blame is not enough to promote cooperation.
However, once subjects actually experience being blamed, they contribute
significantly more in the following round. When disapproval is expressed
in the subject's own words, unlike in previous studies, social sanctions
were found to have a stronger impact on cooperation. The experience of
being praised, in contrast, does not have such an effect. These results
suggest that subjects may be more sensitive to the disutility of being
blamed than to the utility of being praised.}"
"{We use experimental methods to study the power of leading by words. The
context is a voluntary contribution mechanism with one-way
communication. One group member can send a free-form text message to his
fellow players. Contrary to the commonly accepted wisdom that the
cooperation-enhancing effect of communication requires the mutual
exchange of promises, we find that the introduction of one-way
communication increases contributions substantially and decreases their
variation. When communication is one-shot, its effect on contribution
levels persists over time. Moreover, one-way communication is effective
even in the absence of strategic concerns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

"{In this paper, we study the effect of pre-play announcements and ex-post
observation of decisions on voluntary public good provision. We find
that requiring announcements, in conjunction with making contribution
decisions public, has a significantly positive effect on the average
level of contributions. Those treatments, in which announcements are
elicited, permit the truthfulness of subjects' announcements to be
measured. We find that high contributors are more honest, the
truthfulness of others is reciprocated with greater honesty and
announcements are more honest when contribution decisions are
observable.}"
"{We conduct a repeated VCM (voluntary contribution mechanism) experiment
using the strategy method and compare contribution behavior in a partner
and a stranger matching in both a cold and a hot setting, where the
latter differs from the former by allowing participants to revise their
strategies in each round. Irrespective of whether the setting is hot or
cold we find that partners provide higher initial contributions than
strangers. In the cold setting (without revision possibility) partners
contribute more on average but do not react differently to past
contributions by others than strangers. In the hot setting the dynamic
contribution plans of strangers are somewhat upward-shifted. Furthermore
the contributions of partners decrease more strongly than those of
strangers over time in a hot setting. The reason for this effect lies in
the fact that partners react much more strongly to negative experiences
than strangers. Our design and results contribute to explaining the
mixed evidence in the literature on partner versus stranger
comparisons.and allow us to understand under which conditions commitment
can be conducive or harmful to achieving and sustaining higher levels of
contribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{We let subjects in a voluntary contribution experiment make non-binding
numerical announcements about their ``possible{''} Contributions and, in
Some treatments, send written promises to contribute specific amounts.
We find that announcements were responded to both by others'
announcements and by real play, for example announcements led to costly
punishment when found to be misleading. We also find that adding
pre-play announcements to treatments with punishment can increase
efficiency by letting cost-free warnings substitute for costly
punishment. The threat of punishing false announcements and promises
helps reduce false signals, but Only when promise statements can be sent
is the effect sufficient for achieving greater efficiency. (C) 2008

contributions decline over time. We use a two-stage voluntary
contribution game to investigate whether this decrease is caused by
learning or strategic behavior. Using a strategy method we find a robust
pattern of declining contributions: contributions in stage 2 are 45
percent lower than in stage 1. Repeating the game five times we find
that experience generates a smaller decline in contributions: stage I
contributions decrease by around 7 percent per game. Finally we find no
significant differences between the strategy and direct-response method,
which suggests that our results help explain behavior in the latter. (C)

Vesterlund in J Public Econ 87:627-657, 2003). In contrast the ability

when such returns are commonly known. In our environment the success of
leadership therefore appears to be driven by signaling rather than by
nonpecuniary factors such as reciprocity.}"
"{Schelling Charitable contributions are frequently made over time. Donors
are free to contribute whenever they wish and as often as they want, and
are frequently updated on the level of contributions by others. A
dynamic structure enables donors to condition their contribution on that
of others, and, as Schelling {[}Schelling, Thomas C., The Strategy of
Conflict Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1960.] suggested, it
may establish trust thereby increasing charitable giving. Marx and
Matthews {[}Marx, Leslie, and Steven Matthews, ``A Dynamic Voluntary
Contribution to a Public Project,{''} Review of Economic Studies, 67,
2000, 327-358.] build on Schelling's insight and show that multiple
contribution rounds may secure a provision level that cannot be achieved
in the static, one-shot setting, but only if there is a discrete,
positive payoff jump upon completion of the project. We examine these
two hypotheses experimentally using static and dynamic public good
games. We find that contributions are indeed higher in the dynamic than
in the static game. However, in contrast to the predictions, the
increase in contributions in the dynamic game does not depend critically
on the existence of a completion benefit jump or on whether players can
condition their decisions on the behavior of other members of their
group. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"

Using business student subjects and a low marginal per capita rate of

voting, and a status quo of not giving to 94\% in a VCM with initial
cheap talk, voting, and a status quo of giving. The results demonstrate
that context can make the VCM produce sustained efficiencies similar to

"{We examine the effects of leading by example in voluntary contribution
experiments. Leadership is implemented by letting one group member
contribute to the public good before followers do. Such leadership
increases contributions in comparison to the standard voluntary
contribution mechanism, especially so when it goes along with authority
in the form of granting the leader exclusion power. Whether leadership
is fixed or rotating among group members has no significant influence on
contributions. Only a minority of groups succeeds in endogenously
installing a leader, even though groups with leaders are much more

increase contributions to public goods in laboratory experiments. We
find, as in earlier experiments, that face-to-face communication has
very strong effects, but surprisingly that verbal communication through
a chat room preserving anonymity and excluding facial expression, etc.

terminals, had no net effect on contributions or efficiency. Punishment,

"{The prospect of receiving a monetary sanction for free riding has been
shown to increase contributions to public goods. We ask whether the
impulse to punish is unresponsive to the cost to the punisher, or
whether, like other preferences, it interacts with prices to generate a
conventional demand curve. In a series of experiments, we randomly vary
the cost of reducing the earnings of other group members following
voluntary contribution decisions. In our design, new groups are formed
after each interaction and no subject faces any other more than once, so
there is no strategic reason to punish. We nonetheless find significant
levels of punishment, and we learn that both price and the extent to
which the recipient's contribution is below the group mean are
significant determinants of the quantity of punishment demanded.
Moreover, punishment is mainly directed at free riders even when it
costs nothing to the punisher. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

view. It yields information about situations where, in purely pecuniary
terms, it is a dominant strategy to contribute all the endowment and
about situations where it is a dominant strategy to contribute nothing.
Our results show, first, that differences in behavior across countries
are minor. We find that when people play `the same game' they behave

"{This study shows a public good experiment with four different
treatments. The payoff function is chosen so that the Nash equilibrium
(NE) and the collective optimum (CO) are both in the interior of the
strategy space. This study tries to test the effect of varying the level
of the collective optimum, which changes the `social dilemma', involved
in the decision as to how much to contribute to the public good. The
results show that contributions increase with the level of the interior
CO. There is overcontribution in comparison to the NE and
undercontribution in comparison to the CO. But contributions are as far
from the CO as the level of the former increases. An overcontribution
index that takes into account the effective contribution relative to
both the NE and the CO, shows that subjects adopt a constant behaviour
while passing from one treatment to another: they contribute a constant
share of the CO.}"

an endogenous probability of public good provision into the voluntary
contributions mechanism. Specifically, the two treatments allow for
nonprovision even with positive contributions. In one treatment, the
provision probability rises with increased contributions (while
preserving the dominant strategy equilibrium of zero contributions). The
results show that uncertainty per se lowers individual but not group
contributions, lagged marginal incentives significantly predict
contributions, and individuals significantly react to own-deviations
from average group contributions. This has implications for work teams
or professional sports teams who see increased probability of group
rewards given higher effort levels. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}"
"{Numerous laboratory experiments have investigated the performance of
several processes for providing public goods through voluntary

the pessimistic prediction of standard models. One such feature is the
`'marginal per-capita return'' (MPCR) front the public good. Various
authors have altered MPCR between groups or for an entire group at the
same time. The experiments reported here address a different question,
`'What would happen if, within a group, some persons faced a `high' MPCR

between full contribution and the observed level of contribution is
greater than or equal to the corresponding difference when free riding
is the best strategy. This surprising result is interpreted as the

amount of payoff they receive but the ranking among them.}"

employ Andreoni's partners/strangers design to measure reputation

concept and coordination problems explain at most a small portion of the
`excessive' giving observed in those previous experiments that use an
interior Nash design. Thus, we strengthen the case for interpreting
experimental results as consistent with altruistic preferences that are
not easily overcome by experimental induction.}"

"Examined natural interpersonal sorting processes, and the effect of these processes on group- and individual-level participation in prisoner's dilemma. 95 freshmen each recruited 3 peers to play a 'group bidding game,' an N-person prisoner's dilemma in which anyone could win movie tickets depending on their scores in the game. Prior to playing, all participants completed a measure of prosocial value orientation. Replicating and extending earlier findings (K. M. Sheldon and H. McGregor, 2000), results show that prosocial participants were at a disadvantage within groups. Despite this vulnerability, prosocial participants did no worse overall than asocial participants because a counteracting group-level advantage arose for prosocials, who tended to be concentrated in groups. Implications of this assortative process for the egoism/altruism debate, and for hierarchical selection theory, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Previous research has reported inconclusive and even contradictory findings on the relationship between locus of control and cooperative behavior. The present authors argue that this is because there is no reason to expect that internals are more cooperative than externals, or vice versa. Going back to the definition of the locus of control concept, it was hypothesized that internals are likely to use both cooperative and competitive behavior strategically to further their own self-interest. To test this hypothesis, 39 university students (mean age 22.5 yrs) played 3 repeated prisoner's dilemma games. Their locus of control was measured with Rotter's Internal–External Locus of Control Scale (J. B. Rotter, 1966). Results suggest that internals have the adaptive capacity to instrumentally switch from cooperative to competitive behavior, and vice versa, in prisoner's dilemma games. They also behave more opportunistically when the risk of retaliation is low. The results also make clear that it is essential to study cooperative behavior dynamically.

"There is a huge body of literature on both theoretical and experimental research of behavior in Prisoner's Dilemma and similar non-cooperative settings. Despite this impressive stock of knowledge, the understanding of the determinants of (non-)cooperative behavior remains limited. An important reason is that the economic approach tends to start from the untenable assumption of the homo anonymous. The present study explored the potential gain of cross-fertilizing insights from economics and psychology by relaxing this assumption in a market setting game. More specifically, it is argued that economic agents differ as to their inclination toward cooperation. To analyze this issue, the authors conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of personality on competitive vs cooperative behavior in 5 Prisoner's Dilemma games, using university students. Specifically examined were the effects of 4 personality traits: locus of control, self-monitoring, type-A behavior, and sensation seeking. Results indicate that internal locus of control, high self-monitoring, and high sensation seeking were systematically associated with cooperative behavior. The effect of these 3 personality variables only became apparent, however, in the repeated games and not in the non-interactive settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Although the Prisoner's Dilemma game has been widely investigated, few studies have explored what happens when the doors to the prison are unlocked. Conventional game theoretic analysis predicts greater cooperation in ongoing relationships than with occasional partners. This suggests that an option to exit decreases cooperation by reducing players' dependence on each other for help in the future. An alternative hypothesis is that cooperation increases with selectivity—that is, with the ability to play with a desired partner. This suggests that an exit option increases cooperation. Both hypotheses were tested in laboratory experiments with a total of 91 college students, using 'Trump,' a new card game representation of a Prisoner's Dilemma. In Exp 1, the exit option reduced dependence and increased selectivity, relative to a no-exit condition. It was found that selectivity and dependence both increased cooperation, but for different reasons and with different players, leaving overall cooperation rates unchanged by an option to exit. In Exp 2, the exit option increased selectivity but not dependence, relative to a forced-exit condition. Here higher cooperation was seen with an option to exit, but only for Ss playing defensive strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Examines 2 qualitatively different routes to 'peace' in a controlled laboratory setting to gain a better understanding of the conditions that give rise to one process or the other. The intergroup prisoner's dilemma game was played by 120 college students repeatedly in an attempt to distinguish the dynamic process associated with reciprocation at the intergroup level from that resulting from adaptation at the individual level. Results show that when players were not allowed to communicate with one another, they gradually learned that it does not pay to participate, but when within-group communication was allowed, the overall effect was to increase individual participation. However, it was found that this effect varied greatly in later stages of the game. In some cases, intragroup communication eliminated individual participation and rewarded the members of both teams with the mutually cooperative outcome, but in other cases, it intensified the intergroup conflict to its maximal level of full participation. The implications of these findings for conflict resolution are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Tested whether choosing efficiently in a weak-link game increases cooperative play in a subsequent prisoner's dilemma (PD) game. It is maintained that this cross-game transfer resembles the transfer of cooperative norms in small firms (which are more like coordination games than PDs) as firms grow larger and become like PDs. In Exp 1, 10–14 college students participated in 2-player weak-link coordination games and PD games. The results showed that there is an effect of precedent: a history of efficient play in the 7-action weak-link game is correlated with an increase in efficient play in a subsequent PD game. 33 college students participated in Exp 2. The procedures were almost identical to Exp 1, except that players in a dyad or triad were told the choices by all Ss in their group, rather than simply the minimum choice. The results show that triads had difficulty reaching the efficient equilibrium in the weak-link game. It is concluded that the effect of transfer is much larger in magnitude (increasing cooperation from 15–30% to 71%) than the effects of most variables in previous PD studies.

"Can empathy-induced altruism motivate a person to cooperate in a prisoner's dilemma? To answer this question, 60 undergraduate women were placed in a 1-trial prisoners dilemma, and empathy for the other person was manipulated. Regardless of whether the dilemma was framed as a social exchange or as a business transaction, cooperation was significantly higher among those women led to feel empathy for the other than among those not led to feel empathy. Among those not led to feel empathy, the business frame reduced cooperation, lending support to the idea of an exemption on moral motivation in business transactions. Lack of a business exemption on empathy-induced altruism supported the suggestion that altruism is not simply a type of moral motivation, but is a distinct form of prosocial motivation.

"The fact that people frequently cooperate in the single-trial Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game indicates that their decision making in conflicts is not always guided by game-theoretic analyses of expected outcomes. Whereas most theorists have accounted for cooperation in terms of an ethically rooted concern for matching another's 'good faith' cooperation, others have argued that cooperation reflects several distinct social norms or heuristics. In the latter spirit, the current paper argues that whereas 1 source of cooperation is an effort to match cooperation of others, another source of cooperation is an illusory effort to exert control over others. To distinguish these social decision heuristics and investigate their boundary conditions, we test hypotheses about how their occurrence depends on the timing of decisions in a PD game in which the 2 players move on different days. Two experiments with 353 Ss consistently supported the hypothesis that the control heuristic is more frequent when Ss believe that their counterpart's move lies in the future rather than in the past. Support was also obtained for a second hypothesis that the matching heuristic, by contrast, is less frequent when Ss believe that the counterpart's move lies in the future rather than in the past.

"The experimental study presented in Cox et al. (1991) referred to henceforth as CLM, revealed that culture has a substantial impact on the cooperative or non-cooperative behavior of US-born African, Anglo, Asian and Hispanic Americans in a Prisoner's Dilemma setting. The present article complements CLM's study in three ways. First, CLM's experiment is replicated with a sample of 40 Dutch undergraduates. This replication confirms the major finding of the CLM study that culture matters. Second, the role of uncertainty is included by introducing two different information regimes, indicating that uncertainty regarding the opponent's future behavior facilitates cooperation. Third, CLM's study is extended by analyzing the influence of education, particularly, knowledge of the competition or game theory of economics. It is found that knowledge of behavioral theories or 'soft' economics does stimulate cooperative behavior, but that it has no impact on opportunism. The first point supports the claim in Holler et al. (1992) and Frank et al. (1993) that education plays a role in determining the cooperative or non-cooperative attitudes among managers and students, while the second underscores CLM's observation that culture does matter.

"Examined how experience influences individual behavior adoption of learning strategies. Female college students first played a pseudo-prisoner's dilemma (PPD) game with the experimenter, who followed a fixed strategy. Exp 1 included 80 Ss, and the experimenter's strategies for different groups were: (1) play tit-for-tat; (2) play randomly; (3) always cooperate; (4) always defect. Only the tit-for-tat group increased cooperation over trials; other groups decreased cooperation. After playing the PPD with the experimenter, Ss played an actual prisoner's dilemma (PD) game with each other. In the PD game, Ss began cooperating moderately but cooperation deteriorated regardless of what the experimenter's strategy had been in the earlier (PPD) game. In Exp 2, 120 Ss again played a PPD game with the experimenter and then played a PD game with each other. Half played 1 trial at a time as in the 1st experiment while half played in patterns of 4 trials at a time. In the PD game, patterning of trials retarded the development of mutual defection regardless of previous experience.

Dulany's theory of propositional control in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. The theory holds that a person's behavior (B) is a function of his behavior intention (BI) which is determined by his attitude toward the act (A-act) and by his beliefs about the expectations of the other player, i.e., social normative beliefs (NBs). 2 PD games differing in Cooperation Index (CI) were each played in a cooperative, a competitive, and an individualistic motivational orientation. 16 groups, 8 male and 8 female, were assigned to each of the 3 motivational conditions. CI and motivational orientations affected questionnaire measures of the theoretical constructs and game behavior as expected. Their influence on B was mediated by BI through A-act and NBs. BI correlated highly with B and was in turn accurately predicted from A-act and NBs in a multiple-regression equation. The relative importance of A-act and NBs in predicting BI and B varied as expected with the motivational orientation: in the cooperative condition… (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The tit-for-tat strategy is known for its ability to train cooperation during an iterated 2-person prisoner's dilemma. In this research, a repeated measures design was used to assess the nature and long-term persistence of such training. One month after playing against a programmed tit-for-tat strategy, participants returned to the lab to play a randomly matched other participant. Participants increased their levels of cooperative behavior, both during the 1st sequence and in the 2nd sequence compared with the first. Dispositional competitors increased the most from the 1st to the 2nd sequence and also gained the most new respect for opponents' self-interestedness following the 1st sequence.

"This dissertation examines the effects of prior strict competition on subsequent cooperation in mixed-motive situations and investigates whether discussion moderates the relationship between prior competition and subsequent cooperation, The experience of prior competition in a zero-sum game is hypothesized to decrease subsequent cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma games. A laboratory experiment with a 2 (Competition versus No-Competition) 2 (Discussion versus No-Discussion) between-subjects factorial design using games was conducted with 254 college students. In the Competition condition, another 2 (Winner versus loser) 2 (Discussion versus No-Discussion) factorial design was used to examine the effect of winning versus losing in prior competition on subsequent cooperation. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and covariance (MANCOVA), and other statistical analyses were performed with dependent variables including subjects' choices and expectations of cooperation. The results indicate that prior competition decreases subsequent cooperation. Particularly, losers decreased subsequent cooperation with winners if there was no discussion. The results confirm that discussion promotes subsequent cooperation and identify that discussion does not moderate the effect of prior competition but moderates the effect of winning and losing on subsequent cooperation.

African American males, in particular, are frequently the object of racial bias and fear responses (Dembo, 1988). This study was designed to explore several facets of crossracial interactions of young male African Americans and Caucasian Americans. Specific goals were to analyze how the presentation of information that another young male, from a different racial group, displaying either high or low levels of fear in interracial interactions and either high or low levels of prejudicial attitudes would affect rates of cooperative behavior in a mixed-motive game and social impression ratings of identified co-players. In addition, responses on a self-reported measure related to racial attitudes were utilized to regroup participants by theoretical stages of development, and then reanalyze game playing responses. Sixty-seven male African American and sixty-eight male Caucasian American middle school, secondary school and two-year college students (ages 11-20) living in suburban regions of New York State participated in the study. Each participant played four, twenty-five trial rounds of a mixed-motive prisoner's dilemma game with different race co-players identified as demonstrating either high or low levels of fear responses during interracial interactions, and racial prejudice. Participants played the game with identified co-players on a computer making choices according to a randomly generated sixty percent cooperative response rate. The study took the form of a 2 x 2 x 2 design, with race of participant (African American vs. Caucasian American), perception of fear in interracial interaction (high vs. low), and perception of racial bias (high vs. low) as factors. Rate of cooperative responses during each phase of the prisoner's dilemma game was measured as a dependent variable both within subjects and between racial groups. In addition a social impression rating of identified co-players was taken following each round of the game. The Racial Attitude Identity Scale (RIAS) or White Racial Attitude Identity Scale (WRIAS) (Helms, 1990), was analyzed as a non-manipulated independent variable by grouping participants into theoretical identity development stages. Demographic information (parent education, family income) and prior experience with cooperative learning strategies in school settings was also collected. It was hypothesized but not supported that: (1) male African Americans in the high fear-low prejudice condition would have the highest rates of cooperation and those in the low fear-high prejudice condition would cooperate the least across all groups; (2) Caucasian Americans in high fear-low prejudice condition would cooperate at lower rates than African Americans in the same experimental condition. Support was found for the following hypotheses: (1) Across racial groups, participants in low fear-low prejudice conditions rated co-players more positively on the social impression rating; (2) Among African American participants in immersion-emersion stage of racial identity development on the RIAS cooperated at lower levels than other stages; and (3) Caucasian Americans in the reintegration stage on the WRIAS cooperated less than other developmental stages.

"Physically abused children demonstrate increased levels of aggression and withdrawal within their peer group, which places them at risk for peer rejection, loneliness and depression. An important mediator in the relationship between the early experience of abuse and later maladaptive social behavior is thought to be biased and deficient information processing patterns. However, the behavior and information processing of abused children have not been examined within the context of close friendships. The current study examined these variables while physically abused children and their close friends played the Prisoner's Dilemma, a game in which cooperation and trust are necessary to optimize outcome. Subjects were 16 children (10 boys and 6 girls) aged five to nine about whom 'clear and convincing' evidence for physical abuse was found, 19 nonabused children (6 boys and 13 girls) matched on sex, age socioeconomic status and ethnicity, and the abused children's closest same-sex friends. In order to elicit the children's information processing about the game, a videotape of the children's interaction was replayed to each child. Abused children were more competitive during the game (F (1,59) = 4.62, p <), had more goals indicative of fear prior to the game (F (1,59) = 4.10, p <), and when their friends competed, were significantly more likely to show a hostile attributional bias on forced choice questions (F (1,31) = 4.50, p <) compared to nonabused children. In relation to their own behavior in the game, abused children tended to think that their friend was sad or mad (F (1,32) = 8.12, p <), and disliked them (F (1,32) = 8.12, p <). Information processing patterns were important correlates of abused children's behavior during the game, with fearful pregame goals (r = -, p <) and children's negative evaluations of their own behavior (r = -, p <) associating with competition during the game. The results of this study suggest that, for young abused children, improving cooperation skills and information processing within their close friendships may be an important adjunct to social skills training within the peer group.

"Refined and experimentally tested a theory of relational cohesion that explains how and when actors become committed to one another in the context of multiactor exchange. The theory asserts that frequent social exchange results in (1) positive emotions that solidify and strengthen the person–group bond and (2) uncertainty reduction that renders the focal group more salient in relation to others. These 2 mechanisms produce a sense of psychological group formation and ultimately increase observable acts of commitment. A total of 384 undergraduate students participated in a 'productive exchange' task, in which 3 actors negotiated a joint venture that required the assent of all members. The exchanges featured 2 forms of commitment behavior: the giving of small token gifts and the decision to invest in a 2-way prisoner's dilemma. The results suggest that positive emotion and uncertainty reduction are theoretically distinct and affect commitment behavior through different mechanisms. The article concludes by discussing the general implications for commitment and social order. A formalization of the modified theory of relational cohesion is appended.

"Tested in an experimental situation, the reciprocity game, consisting of a prisoner's dilemma game (PD) followed by a dictator game (DG). The sample was composed of 74 Italian undergraduate students. In line with the model's predictions, the experimental results showed that participants reciprocate the behavior of the opponent in the PD. In the DG, if the opponent cooperated, participants gave back an almost equal share, whereas if the opponent defected, participants gave a minimal amount. These reciprocity effects are modulated by individual differences in the concern for reciprocity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This experiment examined the competitive behavior in a seven-choice Prisoner's Dilemma game of 108 adult students (68 women, 40 men) classified as high, average, or low in competitiveness based on their scores on the Competitiveness Index (R. D. Smither and J. M. Houston, 1992). Participants were then presented one of three preprogrammed response conditions representing (1) Competitive, (2) De-escalating, or (3) Noncompetitive conflict behavior from a simulated opponent. Participants high in competitiveness engaged in more competitive behavior and reported higher satisfaction with the task than those low in competitiveness. As expected, the Competitive conditions elicited more competitive behavior than Noncompetitive conditions. The results suggest competitive individuals may be particularly susceptible to social cues that trigger competitive behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Proposed that face-to-face contact fosters the development of rapport and thereby helps negotiators coordinate on mutually beneficial settlements in mixed-motive conflicts. Specifically, the authors investigate whether, in a cooperative climate, negotiators' visual access to each other's nonverbal behavior fosters a dyadic state of rapport that facilitates mutual cooperation. Exp 1 manipulated whether 134 graduate business students stood face-to-face or side-by-side (unable to see each other) in a simulated strike negotiation. Face-to-face dyads were more likely to coordinate on a settlement early in the strike, resulting in higher joint gains. Exp 2 manipulated whether previously unacquainted negotiators (half of the students were graduate business students and the other half were undergraduates) conversed face-to-face or by telephone before separating to play a conflict game with the structure of a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Face-to-face dyads were more likely to coordinate on high joint gain outcomes. The facilitatory effect of face-to-face contact was statistically mediated by a measure of dyadic rapport. Results did not support alternative interpretations based on individual-level positive affect or expectations about opponents. The authors conclude with a discussion of the role of affective and dyad-level processes in social psychological models of conflict resolution.

"Examined how surveillance and sanctioning systems affect cooperative behavior in dilemma situations. In Exp 1, 84 college students participated in a 2-party, prisoner's dilemma to explore the influence of weak sanctioning systems on behavior and expectations of others' behavior. In Exp 2, 56 graduate business students participated in a multiparty social dilemma scenario that sought additional support for the findings of the 1st study and examined whether the perception of the situation is altered by sanctioning systems. Findings from these studies indicate that a weak sanctioning system results in less cooperation than no sanctioning system. Results from Exp 2 suggest that sanctions affect the type of decision people perceive they are making, prompting them to see it as a business rather than an ethical decision. The results from these studies were used to develop a theoretical model that postulates that the relationship between sanctions and cooperation is due to both a signaling effect and a processing effect. A 3rd study in which 133 graduate business students participated in the same social dilemma scenario used in Exp 2 with an additional condition (strong-sanction) provided support for the processing-effect hypothesis. Organizational implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Extended the domain of the disjunction effect under strategic uncertainty and reason-based choice. 80 college students were randomly assigned to either the role of 'row player' or 'column player.' Ss played prisoner's dilemma games like the ones used in E. Shafir and A. Tversky's study (1992), asymmetric prisoners' dilemma games, games of iterated dominance, and games that tested the alternative explanation of complexity. In the 1st treatment, No Guessing, Ss played the games and were dismissed. In the 2nd treatment, Guessing, Ss played the same games but prior to each game were asked for their best guess of what their counterpart in the game would do. Results show that in the symmetric and asymmetric prisoners' dilemma and games of iterated dominance, a significant difference in playing behavior was found between the Guessing and No Guessing treatments in a direction consistent with that predicted by reason-based choice. These results extend the domain of the disjunction effect from the traditional prisoners' dilemma to an asymmetric version of it, as well as to a game in which only 1 player has a dominant strategy. In the complexity explanation game, the disjunction effect was not observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Examined whether the choice of more abstract alternatives in self-control situations would correlate with or generalize to choice of more abstract alternatives in social choice situations and if experiences in one sphere would transfer to another. Eight female undergraduates played a self-control game in which choice of the higher of 2 monetary rewards in the present trial reduced the overall reward. Other Ss played a prisoner's dilemma (social cooperation) game in which choices alternated so that overall reward-reducing consequences of choosing the higher current amount were experienced by the other player. Ss playing the self-control game chose the lower current amount (and the higher overall reward) more frequently than did those playing the social cooperation game. In the 2nd phase, half the Ss who had played the self-control game played the social cooperation game and visa-versa. Little or no transfer was observed between conditions. In a 2nd experiment, raising the amount of the next-trial reward increased self-control but not social cooperation. Some transfer between self-control and social cooperation was observed.

"In line with a social-support-for-shared-self-interest interpretation of competitive intergroup behavior, J. Schopler et al (1993) observed that, in the face of consistent cooperative outgroup behavior, two ingroup members behaved competitively when this strategy had been suggested by another (role-playing) ingroup member. Because a comparable amount of competitive prisoner's dilemma game choosing was observed in a no-suggestion condition with two Ss and one neutral role player (single no-suggestion condition), Schopler et al assumed that the two Ss, motivated by greed, each initiated and supported competitive suggestions. Within the boundaries of the Schopler et al research paradigm, the present experiment aimed to test this assumption by adding a no-suggestion cooperative feedback condition with two neutral role players, rendering impossible any form of explicit social support. 74 college students participated as subjects while an additional 25 participated as role players. A significant reduction of competitive responding was observed in the new no-suggestion condition. It was also observed that the single no-suggestion condition yielded less competition than a manipulated (explicit) competitive suggestion condition.

"In their research on individual-group discontinuity using Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG), J. Schopler et al (1991) observed that groups were more competitive than individuals. Alternatively, it is proposed that this effect can be interpreted as a group-adaptiveness phenomenon. In a 2 (individuals vs groups) × 2 (low vs high incentives to cooperate) PDG study, individuals and groups played against a cooperative opponent. 84 college students participated. Individual–group discontinuity was found when incentives to cooperate were low, but not when incentives were high. Results further suggest that the stronger intergroup competition observed in past discontinuity research may have been triggered and perpetuated by between-group violations of cooperative proposals. These findings are consistent with the authors' group adaptiveness perspective, which proposes that groups are not invariably more competitive than individuals, but that they are more likely to adapt their behaviors to variations in the task and/or social environment in an attempt to attain important group goals.

"Reports and analyzes the results of 3 trials of a 1-shot collective game (a variety of the assurance game)conducted via the World Wide Web. It was predicted that rational players who read the given analysis and prescription would avert the worst outcomes if a 3rd trial was subsequently held. In the game, each player selects either box A or box B, in light of 3 possible outcomes ($1,000 [in virtual dollars] to each player, if and only if all players choose box A; $100 to each player who chooses box B, if and only if at least one-fourth of the players choose box B; or $0 to each player). Trial 1 had 156 players, and Trials 2 and 3 had 247 and 34 players, respectively. In the first 2 trials, most players apparently mistook the assurance game for a prisoner's dilemma and consequently attained the worst possible outcome. After contemplating appropriate strategic considerations, players who participated in the 3rd trial attained a better outcome but did so in a surprising way. This report accounts explicitly for the unexpected results. Implicitly, it also reveals some potential for social experimentation in cyberspace.

"According to our reciprocal interdependence hypothesis, derived from the Behavioural Interaction model (BIM), groups in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) will strive more for the long-term goal of mutual cooperation than individuals, provided that the other (programmed) opponent can be expected or trusted to cooperate as well. If the opponent seems to follow a competitive or exploitative strategy groups will behave more competitively than individuals (e.g., J. M. Rabbie et al., 1982). In other PDG research it is found that groups are almost invariably more competitive or less cooperative than individuals (e.g., J. Schopler and C. A. Insko, 1992). Our conjecture is that this individual–group discontinuity effect may be partly attributed to unique features of the experimental procedures of Schopler and Insko which induce mutual (reciprocal) cooperation between individuals and mutual competition between groups. A review of the evidence seems to provide more support for the reciprocity hypothesis than for the various explanations for the discontinuity effect proposed by Schopler, Insko, and their associates.

"The role of perceived physical attractiveness in everyday exchange is addressed using a laboratory paradigm that examines both play vs not-play and cooperate vs defect choices in an ecology of available prisoner's dilemma games. 105 female and 80 male Ss (aged 17–59 yrs) participated. The analysis considers the actions of both S and other in encounters where exchange relationships are possible and include perceptions of others' and own physical attractiveness. Results indicate that Ss are more likely to enter play and to cooperate with others they find attractive. Men who see themselves as more attractive more often cooperate than other men, while women who see themselves as more attractive less often cooperate than other women. In addition, Ss who rate themselves as highly attractive are more likely to cooperate with others they see as also highly attractive. Ss expect others whom they see as attractive to cooperate more often. At the same time, the effect of perceived attractiveness on choice is independent of these expectations, supporting the hypothesis that attractiveness is a 'taste' or 'benefit' for actors in exchange relationships.

"The Stackelberg heuristic is a simulation heuristic in which a player optimizes against best-reply counterstrategies, and a game is Stackelberg-soluble if the resulting Stackelberg strategies are in equilibrium.

"The present research investigates whether a norm of self-interest leads people to focus on material payoffs when making decisions. Our recent research indicates that individuals expect others' behavior to be influenced more by financial incentives than it actually is (Miller & Ratner, 1998). This dissertation examines whether a self-interest norm makes people feel that their own decisions should be guided by material outcomes. If self-interested behavior is indeed a norm, then we would expect people to engage in more self-interested behavior in public and when giving input to a group decision. The results of the present research provide evidence that a norm of self-interest influences the decisions people make. The results of Study 1 suggest that group members make self-interested decisions because they expect this is what other group members want. Study 2 incorporates a public/private manipulation and an individual difference measure of sensitivity to social norms to examine whether a norm of self-interest contributes to the tendency for groups to compete in prisoner's dilemma games. Consistent with predictions, the results of Study 2 indicate that participants expect their peers to want to compete, that it is the individuals high in fear of negative evaluation who give more competitive responses in the group-decision condition, and that participants' responses are more closely aligned to the responses they expect others to give in the group-decision condition. Study 3 extends the present analysis to the domain of procedural and distributive justice to examine whether people feel uncomfortable indicating that they care about fairness of procedures rather than simply the bottom-line material outcomes of those procedures. Consistent with predictions, Study 3 provides preliminary evidence that participants perceive a norm to maximize material outcomes rather than procedural fairness. This evidence for a self-interest norm has important implications for the literature on self-interest and individual and group decision making.

"This study assesses the construct and criterion-related validity of the Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory - II (ROCI-II) with a nonorganizational population. One hundred fifty-three undergraduate students at a small midwestern liberal arts college participated in the study. The construct validity of the ROCI-II was examined using the following methods: exploratory factor analysis, convergent and discriminant relations with 12 personality variables (locus of control, self-monitoring, dogmatism, self-handicapping, shyness, empathic concern, perspective-taking, personal distress, just-world, self-esteem, loneliness and perfectionism), and predicting the impact of the role status of the person with whom one is in conflict (superior, peer, or subordinate) on conflict style usage. Exploratory factor analyses generally supported a four factor structure rather than the five factor structure that Rahim proposes. Correlations between conflict subscales and personality variables provided mixed support, with only 16 of the 33 hypothesized correlations being statistically significant. Results from analyzing the impact of role status on conflict behavior supported all predictions. Criterion-related validity was examined by correlating conflict style scores with conflict behavior in a prisoner's dilemma game for 50 of the participants. It was expected that the integrating conflict style would correlate with cooperative behavior and the dominating conflict style would correlate with competitive behavior. However, these correlations were nonsignificant. The validity of using the ROCI-II with nonorganizational populations is discussed, as is the conclusion that situational factors (e.g., the power dynamic between conflicting parties) appears to be more important in predicting use of conflict strategies than are personality variables.

"Proposes an operant approach to the emergence of cooperation in the iterated Prisoners' Dilemma (IPD). The approach yields to the design of reinforcement-learning agents whose behavioral repertoire includes not only cooperation-related behaviors, but also controlling behaviors that may influence the behavior of the other player. The task of an agent is to learn to coordinate its own cooperation- and control-related behaviors with those of the other agents. The results of a simulation of the IPD are presented. It is suggested that this situation is closer to natural cooperative situations than the classical approaches to the IPD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Sanctioning increases cooperation in public goods games, but not indiscriminately under all conditions and in all societies, and the mechanisms by which sanctioning exercises its impact on behavior are yet to be studied in detail. We show experimentally that in the presence of sanctioning, our experimental subjects adjust their behavior in order to avoid being a free rider. They do this not only in the STANDARD sanctions treatment, where they directly experience any sanctions assigned to them, but also in our main treatment, the SECRET sanctions treatment, where no information on sanctions received is available until the end of the experiment.We observe no such free riding avoidance in the treatment without sanctioning. The mere knowledge that sanctions might be assigned increases cooperation among the members of our subject pool; subjects expect that non-strategic sanctioning occurs against the free riders. Moreover, these expectations are correct as we observe a similar pattern and extent of sanctioning in both treatments. We propose that sanctioning in itself is a social norm and may be culturally dependent, as suggested in the literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

While a higher level of redistributive taxation decreases the price of voluntary giving, it also changes the income distribution by decreasing income inequality.

The experimental findings show that while the participants decrease their voluntary contributions as the pre-tax income distribution becomes more equal, they increase their contributions with taxation. These findings have important implications for government policies regarding privately provided public goods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Behaviour in public good experiments is usually attributed partly to rational self-interest and partly to social norms and preferences.

A pre-experimental measure of social desirability (SDS17) was used to match partners in a two-person public good game. Half the participants received experimenter approval based upon their investment. Contrary to predictions, the highest public good investment was by low social desirability participants in the approval condition. Social desirability was not positively related to pro-social behaviour. We consider its relation to experimental and social conformity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Heterogeneity in contribution levels within public goods games (PGGs) is indicative of individual self- or other-regarding preferences. Reward and punishment mechanisms have been demonstrated to affect contributions in the PGGs. This paper examines whether dispositional sensitivities to rewards and punishments (BIS and BAS) explain some behavioural heterogeneity in PGGs. Seventy-two participants took part in a sequential PGG, in which, prior to making a decision about contributing, participants received information about how much their co-players had donated, which was manipulated either as high or low. They also completed the Carver and White BIS/BAS scales. Participants contributed more when other members of their group contributed a high proportion of the initial endowment and less when others gave a low amount. When participants knew that their group members had contributed a high amount, BAS Reward Responsiveness was significantly negatively correlated with the contribution levels, while BIS-anxiety was positively related to a lower proportion of zero contributions. The findings are interpreted in relation to strategic responding in the PGGs. Motivational traits, such as those conceptualized in Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory, are proposed to underlie pro-social behavioural preferences.

"International efforts to provide global public goods often face the challenges of coordinating national contributions and distributing costs equitably in the face of uncertainty, inequality, and free-riding incentives. In an experimental setting, we distribute endowments unequally among a group of people who can reach a fixed target sum through successive money contributions, knowing that if they fail, they will lose all their remaining money with 50% probability. In some treatments, we give players the option to communicate intended contributions. We find that inequality reduces the prospects of reaching the target but that communication increases success dramatically. Successful groups tend to eliminate inequality over the course of the game, with rich players signaling willingness to redistribute early on. Our results suggest that coordination-promoting institutions and early redistribution from richer to poorer nations are both decisive for the avoidance of global calamities, such as disruptive climate change.

"This paper studies, both theoretically and experimentally, framing effects in the context of a public good game in which players have to make a costly contribution either (i) to achieve or (ii) not to lose a non-excludable monetary prize. Our protocol leads to public good provision (not deterioration) only if a certain contribution level is achieved. Since both frames differ with respect to the reference point, we apply Prospect Theory to derive testable predictions. In particular, Prospect Theory predicts—and our experimental evidence confirms—greater contribution in the 'loss' ('gain') frame when the contribution threshold is high (low). We also estimate the parameters which better suit our experimental evidence and partly confirm previous results in the literature. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Recent research on behavioral heterogeneity in social dilemma situations has increasingly focused on exploring the predictive value of individual difference variables. This paper contributes to this line of research by examining how cooperation preferences in a series of three public goods games conducted over the course of five months are related to personality traits and personal values. A variant of the four player one-shot public goods game was administered to classify participants’ cooperation preferences, along with measures of the Big-Five personality dimensions and Rokeach’s terminal values. Results revealed that, when considered independently, Agreeableness and prosocial values were indicative of individual preferences for cooperation. However, when considered simultaneously, only Agreeableness emerged as a significant predictor of cooperation preferences. The findings are interpreted in terms of how personality and personal values jointly impact economic behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A longstanding idea in the literature on human cooperation is that cooperation should be reinforced when conditional cooperators are more likely to interact. In the context of social networks, this idea implies that cooperation should fare better in highly clustered networks such as cliques than in networks with low clustering such as random networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of web-based experiments, in which 24 individuals played a local public goods game arranged on one of five network topologies that varied between disconnected cliques and a random regular graph. In contrast with previous theoretical work, we found that network topology had no significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement between connected neighbors. We then tested both of these possibilities in two subsequent series of experiments in which artificial seed players were introduced, making either full or zero contributions. First, we found that although players did generally behave like conditional cooperators, they were as likely to decrease their contributions in response to low contributing neighbors as they were to increase their contributions in response to high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that positive effects of cooperation were contagious only to direct neighbors in the network. In total we report on 113 human subjects experiments, highlighting the speed, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of web-based experiments over those conducted in physical labs.

"In two studies we investigated the impact of degree of collective failure in a public good dilemma (near miss vs. large miss) on group members' negative reactions (negative affect, attributions of responsibility for the failure, and intention to leave the group). The results show that upward counterfactual thinking has more impact on members' negative responses when experiencing a near miss rather than a large miss. In Experiment 1, the results show that in the case of a near miss (and not a large miss), negative affect and attributions of responsibility were higher when other-focused counterfactuals rather than self-focused counterfactuals were elicited. Negative affect was found to mediate the effect on attributions of responsibility. Experiment 2 replicates these findings on a wider range of negative responses and reveals that the effect of counterfactual thought on willingness to leave the group in the case of a near miss is mediated by attributions of responsibility.

"A number of studies have shown that peer punishment can sustain cooperation in public good games. This paper shows that the format used to give subjects feedback is critical for the efficacy of punishment. Providing subjects with information about the earnings of their peers leads to significantly less cooperation and lower efficiency compared to a treatment in which subjects receive information about the contributions of their peers. This is despite the fact that the feedback format does not affect incentives. The data suggest that this happens because the feedback format acts as a coordination device which influences the contribution standards that groups establish.

"Contributions to public goods are premised on the expectation that the collective will realize benefit in excess of the value of required contributions. However, past research has focused on public goods of fixed and known value, for which the added value of the produced public good is obvious. Research has largely ignored public goods whose eventual value is uncertain at the time contribution decisions are made. Two studies explored the effects of outcome variance on individuals’ contributions to a public good and their reasons for contributing. Contributions were negatively affected by loss prospects in the distribution of possible outcomes. Further, loss prospects directly discouraged contributions because of loss aversion, and indirectly discouraged contributions by fueling fears that others would not contribute. The negative effects of loss prospects were stronger when social uncertainty was low. Implications for social dilemma research and the effective management of collective action are discussed.

We modified the basic public goods experiment by giving subjects the option to 'punish' fellow subjects by reducing their earnings in the experiment and the option to employ anonymity at the punishment stage by deciding whether or not to send their digital photo to the subjects they punished. We used the two assessment instruments to evaluate the personality characteristics and interpersonal needs of the subjects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Why do people persistently contribute to public goods and does it matter to them if their donation makes a difference? A costly signalling perspective suggests that donors might be more concerned about their reputation than the utility of their helping act. We report data on two step-level public goods experiments. We find that in public (vs. private) conditions, contributions go up even when the public good is already provided (Experiment 1) or is unattainable (Experiment 2). Furthermore, these conspicuous donations appear to enhance the status and prestige of the donor because they signal some hidden quality. This research suggests that a public good contribution can be a self-presentation strategy and that the benefits of these contributions to society are sometimes of secondary importance.

"This dissertation examines individual motivation to provide public goods and implications for public policy designed to influence private provision. It merges psychology and sociology with economics to develop a behavioral model in the context of an environmental issue. The model supposes that individuals have preference over their image of themselves as environmentally responsible people. This image is partially determined by norms they hold about how much to contribute to the public good. These norms, in turn, are influenced by policy-makers, for example through a mechanism such as environmental campaigns. The first chapter lays out the conceptualization of norms used in the subsequent chapters. The main points are that I distinguish between statistical norms, what 'is' done, and injunctive norms, what 'should' be done. Injunctive norms are sanctioned either by oneself, others, or both. This simple typology is contrasted with existing conceptualizations of norms in the literature. The second chapter is an empirical analysis which makes some conclusions about how norms affect self-sanctioning through a change in self-image. Survey data regarding hypothetical contributions to a carbon offsetting program show that (1) the higher is one's contribution, the higher is his self-image, and that (2) the higher is one's injunctive norm of how much he thinks one should contribute, the lower is his self-image. This indicates that, depending upon the context, the norm itself should enter individuals' utility functions. It is also shown that self-image itself increases after a contribution has been made, as opposed to individuals making a contribution that is consistent with a given self-image. Chapter 3 combines everything together into a theoretical model in which policy-makers can allocate a given amount of tax revenue between direct provision of a public good and influencing norms to try to increase private provision. An analytical analysis of efficiency and a simulation analysis of welfare effects are conducted. Depending upon individual preferences over private good consumption, public good consumption, and image, a positive investment in norm manipulation can increase social welfare.

"The results of numerous economic games suggest that humans behave more cooperatively than would be expected if they were maximizing selfish interests. It has been argued that this is because individuals gain satisfaction from the success of others, and that such prosocial preferences require a novel evolutionary explanation. However, in previous games, imperfect behavior would automatically lead to an increase in cooperation, making it impossible to decouple any form of mistake or error from prosocial cooperative decisions. Here we empirically test between these alternatives by decoupling imperfect behavior from prosocial preferences in modified versions of the public goods game, in which individuals would maximize their selfish gain by completely (100%) cooperating. We found that, although this led to higher levels of cooperation, it did not lead to full cooperation, and individuals still perceived their group mates as competitors. This is inconsistent with either selfish or prosocial preferences, suggesting that the most parsimonious explanation is imperfect behavior triggered by psychological drives that can prevent both complete defection and complete cooperation. More generally, our results illustrate the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the evolutionary implications of economic experiments, especially the absolute level of cooperation in a particular treatment.

"Why do some developing democracies outperform others in the provision of health and education? This dissertation explores a socio-institutional theory of why politicians choose to allocate resources either broadly across their country, or to narrow societal groups, be they ethnic-, religious-, class-, or regional-based. Relying on a mixed-methods research design, this dissertation first analyzes two countries with similar electoral rules, but vastly different social structures—Thailand (ethnically homogenous) and Mauritius (ethnically diverse). From this qualitative analysis, the dissertation develops a general theory and tests it, using original data on ethno-income and ethno-geographic cross-cuttingness, on health outcomes and spending categories in 43 developing democracies. The dissertation finds that ethnic diversity does not necessarily lead to under-provision of public goods. Appropriately designed electoral rules can lead to the creation of broad, national coalitions that allocate resources to the nation at large rather than to the ethnic group(s) of the government. Second, no single type of electoral rule is necessarily harmful to public goods provision; rather, depending on the type of society in which they operate, PR and majoritarianism can be beneficial or detrimental.

"Gifted adolescents are considered to have high IQs with advanced mathematical and logical performances, but are often thought to suffer from social isolation or emotional mal-adaptation to the social group. The underlying mechanisms that cause stereotypic portrayals of gifted adolescents are not well known. We aimed to investigate behavioral performance of gifted adolescents during social decision-making tasks to assess their affective and social/non-social cognitive abilities. We examined cooperation behaviors of 22 gifted and 26 average adolescents during an iterative binary public goods (PG) game, a multi-player social interaction game, and analyzed strategic decision processes that include cooperation and free-riding. We found that the gifted adolescents were more cooperative than average adolescents. Particularly, comparing the strategies for the PG game between the two groups, gifted adolescents were less sensitive to loss, yet were more sensitive to gain. Additionally, the behavioral characteristics of average adolescents, such as low trust of the group and herding behavior, were not found in gifted adolescents. These results imply that gifted adolescents have a high cognitive ability but a low ability to process affective information or to adapt in social groups compared with average adolescents. We conclude that gain/loss sensitivity and the ability to adapt in social groups develop to different degrees in average and gifted adolescents.

"A fundamental problem in organizations is designing mechanisms for eliciting voluntary contributions from individual members of a team who are entrapped in a social dilemma. To solve the problem, we utilize a game-theoretical framework that embeds the traditional within-team social dilemma in a between-team competition for an exogenously determined prize. In equilibrium, such competition enhances the incentive to contribute, thereby reducing free-riding. Extending existing literature, we focus on asymmetric competitions between teams of unequal size, and competitions between more than two teams. Comparing two protocols for sharing the prize—egalitarian and proportional profit-sharing rules—we find that (i) free-riding diminishes and (ii) team members contribute more toward their team's effort when they belong to the larger team and when the profit-sharing rule is proportional. (iii) Additionally, under the egalitarian profit-sharing rule team members contribute more than predicted by the equilibrium solution. We discuss implications of our findings for eliciting contributions in competitive environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In this paper, we report an experimental investigation of the effect of framing on social preferences, as revealed in a one-shot linear public goods game. We use two types of indicator to measure social preferences: self-reported emotional responses; and, as a behavioural indicator of disapproval, punishment. Our findings are that, for a given pattern of contributions, neither type of indicator depends on the Give versus Take framing that we manipulate. To this extent, they suggest that the social preferences we observe are robust to framing effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We study how announced post-play, face-to-face discussions affect individual contributions to a public good in an experimental setting. To our surprise ex-post discussions reduced the average contribution to the public good. The negative impact of discussions was turned around when we labelled the choice of not contributing to the public good as ‘free-riding’. The same label had no impact in the no-discussion baseline version of our game. Our explanation of why we observe these patterns is that the announcement of ex-post discussions draws attention to empirical expectations (what will others do?) and to norms of cooperation (what is the morally right choice?).

"Research on information sharing in group decision-making has widely assumed a cooperative context and focused on the exchange of shared or unshared information in the hidden profile paradigm (Stasser & Titus, 1985, 1987), neglecting the role of information importance. We argue that information sharing is a mixed-motive conflict setting that gives rise to motivated strategic behavior. We introduce a research paradigm that combines aspects of the traditional information sampling paradigm with aspects of a public good dilemma: the information pooling game. In three experiments, we show that information sharing is strategic behavior that depends on people’s pro-social or pro-self motivation, and that people consider information sharedness and information importance when deciding whether to reveal, withhold, or falsify their private or public information. Pro-social individuals were consistently found to honestly reveal their private and important information, while selfish individuals strategically concealed or even lied about their private and important information.

"Laboratory experiments indicate that many people willingly contribute to public goods and punish free riders at a personal cost. We hypothesize that these individuals, called strong reciprocators, allow political parties to overcome collective action problems, thereby allowing those organizations to compete for scarce resources and to produce public goods for like-minded individuals. Using a series of laboratory games, we examine whether partisans contribute to public goods and punish free riders at a greater rate than nonpartisans. The results show that partisans are more likely than nonpartisans to contribute to public goods and to engage in costly punishment. Given the broad theoretical literature on altruistic punishment and group selection as well as our own formal evolutionary model, we hypothesize that it is being a partisan that makes an individual more likely to be a strong reciprocator and not vice versa.

"Economic Experimental Games have shown that individuals make decisions that deviate down from the suboptimal Nash equilibrium. However, few studies have analyzed the case when deviation is above the Nash equilibrium. Extracting from above the Nash equilibrium is inefficient not only socially but also privately and it would exacerbate the tragedy of the commons. That would be the case of a race to the fish when stocks are becoming depleted or driver behavior on a highly congested road. The objective of this study is to analyze private inefficient extraction behavior in experimental games and to associate the type of player and the type of player group with such inefficient outcomes. To do this, we carried out economic experimental games with local coastal fishermen in Colombia, using a setting where the scarcity of the resource allows for an interior Nash equilibrium and inefficient over-extraction is possible. The state of the resource, the type of player and the composition of the group explain, in part, this inefficient behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Using a laboratory experiment, we investigate whether a variety of behaviors in repeated games are related to an array of individual characteristics that are popular in economics: risk attitude, time preference, trust, trustworthiness, altruism, strategic skills in one-shot matrix games, compliance with first-order stochastic dominance, ability to plan ahead, and gender. We do find some systematic relationships. A subject’s compliance with first-order stochastic dominance as well as, possibly, patience, gender, and altruism have some systematic effects on her behavior in repeated games. At the level of a pair of subjects who are playing a repeated game, each subject’s gender as well as, possibly, patience and ability to choose an available dominant strategy in a one-shot matrix game systematically affect the frequency of the cooperate–cooperate outcome. However, overall, the number of systematic relationships is surprisingly small. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In risky and other multiattribute choices, the process of choosing is well described by random walk or drift diffusion models in which evidence is accumulated over time to threshold. In strategic choices, level‐k and cognitive hierarchy models have been offered as accounts of the choice process, in which people simulate the choice processes of their opponents or partners. We recorded the eye movements in 2 × 2 symmetric games including dominance‐solvable games like prisoner's dilemma and asymmetric coordination games like stag hunt and hawk–dove. The evidence was most consistent with the accumulation of payoff differences over time: we found longer duration choices with more fixations when payoffs differences were more finely balanced, an emerging bias to gaze more at the payoffs for the action ultimately chosen, and that a simple count of transitions between payoffs—whether or not the comparison is strategically informative—was strongly associated with the final choice. The accumulator models do account for these strategic choice process measures, but the level‐k and cognitive hierarchy models do not. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{Recent research has examined the effects of oxytocin (OT) and
vasopressin (AVP) on human social behavior and brain function. However,
most participants have been male, while previous research in our lab
demonstrated sexually differentiated effects of OT and AVP on the neural
response to reciprocated cooperation. Here we extend our previous work
by significantly increasing the number of participants to enable the use
of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit more precise
localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to
receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo.
Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Sex differences were
observed for effects of OT on the neural response to reciprocated
cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen response among
males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT
may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions
among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women.
Similar sex differences were also observed for AVP effects within
bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus when a more liberal
statistical threshold was employed. While our findings support previous
suggestions that exogenous nonapeptides may be effective treatments for
disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorder, they caution
against uniformly extending such treatments to men and women alike.}"
"{One of the hallmark findings from behavioral economics is that choices
are sensitive to the context they are presented in. However, the
strength of such `framing effects' varies between studies, and some
studies fail to find any effect at all. A long line of research has
argued that the presence and size of framing effects depend to a large
extent on whether people use higher or lower-level mental decision
making processes (or heuristics). A similarly important line of research
in social psychology and economics suggests that higher-level mental
processes such as self-control draw upon a limited pool of mental
resources that can be exhausted. This study links these two lines of
research and investigates whether depleting people's mental resources
(or `willpower') affects the degree to which they are susceptible to
framing effects. In three separate experiments we depleted participants'
willpower using the commonly used Stroop task method, and subsequently
made them take part in a series of tasks, including a framed prisoner's
dilemma, an attraction effect task and an anchoring effect task.
However, though we find strong evidence of a framing effect in all three
tasks, the strength of these effects is not affected by induced changes
in the level of willpower depletion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"{The present study investigated if the gaze-cuing effect (i.e., the
tendency for observers to respond faster to targets in locations that
were cued by others' gaze direction than to not-cued targets) is

established during a previous interaction with a cuing face. In two
experiments, participants played a series of single-shot games of a
modified version of the two-choice Prisoner's Dilemma against eight
simulated contenders. They were shown a fictive feedback indicating if
the opponents chose to cooperate or compete with them. Opponents' faces
were then used as stimuli in a standard gaze-cuing task. In Experiment 1
females classified as average in competitiveness were tested, while in
Experiment 2 females classified as high and low in competitiveness were
tested. We found that only in females classified as low and average in
competitiveness the gaze-cuing effect for competitive contenders was
greater than for cooperative contenders. These findings suggest that
competitive opponents represent a relevant source of information within
the social environment and female observers with low and average levels
of competition cannot prevent from keeping their eyes over them. (C)

"{Intranasal oxytocin (OT) can modulate social-emotional functioning and
related brain activity in humans. Consequently, OT has been discussed as
a potential treatment for psychiatric disorders involving social
behavioral deficits. However, OT effects are often heterogeneous across
individuals. Here we explore individual differences in OT effects on the
neural response to social cooperation as a function of the rs53576
polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). Previously, we
conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which healthy men
and women were randomized to treatment with intranasal OT or placebo.
Afterwards, they were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging
while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex
partners. Within the left ventral caudate nucleus, intranasal OT
treatment increased activation to reciprocated cooperation in men, but
tended to decrease activation in women. Here, we show that these sex
differences in OT effects are specific to individuals with the rs53576
GG genotype, and are not found for other genotypes (rs53576 AA/AG).
Thus, OT may increase the reward or salience of positive social
interactions for male GG homozygotes, while decreasing those processes
for female GG homozygotes. These results suggest that rs53576 genotype
is an important variable to consider in future investigations of the
clinical efficacy of intranasal OT treatment.}"

interpersonal conflict/collaboration among teens engaged in NSSI or
having made a suicide attempt. The current study, therefore, compared
interpersonal functioning indexed by the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) task
among three mutually exclusive groups, adolescents (ages 13-17): engaged
in NSSI only without history of a suicide attempt (n=26); who made a
suicide attempt without history of NSSI (n=26); and typically developing

others' behaviors and feelings. No significant between-group differences
were found in PD task performance; however, compared to typically
developing control participants and those who had made a suicide
attempt, the NSSI group reported significantly more stress during the
task. Additionally, NSSI participants rated themselves as more
interpersonally sensitive compared to both attempters and typically
developing controls. Given the lack of knowledge about whether these

"{Some accounts of cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma have focused on
developing simple indexes of a game's severity - i.e., the degree to
which a game promotes non-cooperative choices - which are derived wholly
from the game's payoff structure. However, the psychological mechanisms
of why a game's payoffs affect cooperation rates are not clearly
explicated with this approach. We show how simple models of decision
making can predict the emergence of trust based cooperation as the
expected utility maximizing strategy when individual social preferences
and positive expectations (beliefs) are simultaneously taken into
account. Moreover, we show how these predictions relate to a particular
game's index of cooperation. We then delineate under what conditions
trust based cooperation is rationalizable, and how the decision to trust
can be understood in terms of an interaction between payoffs,
preferences, and beliefs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{BackgroundThe high rate of incarceration in the USA warrants continued
exploration into understanding and ameliorating criminal behaviour. The
growing use of cooperative games to measure developing prosocial
behaviours has never been explored in a US criminal justice population.
AimsThe aim of this study is to examine cooperative game play among
offenders under supervision in the community. We hypothesised that the
offenders would use more guarded and self-preserving strategies and be
more likely to excel in short-lived interactions than law-abiding
community citizens.
MethodsCommunity supervised offenders (83) and general population
comparison participants (41) were recruited by town centre adverts
placed in popular shops. Using the supervision centres as venues, all
participants were asked to complete four cooperative games (prisoner's
dilemma, public goods game, ultimatum game and trust game), not knowing
the identity of the other player who was always, in fact, the
experimenter.
ResultsThe offender and general population groups were similar in age
(early 30s), sex (2/3 men), race (45\% white) and IQ distribution (low
average range). Offenders made lower offers in the ultimatum game, had
lower scores in the prisoner's dilemma, made lower investments and
offered lower returns in the trust game and contributed less in the
public goods game.
ConclusionsEven community-based offenders thus seem to have deficits in
the kinds of gameplay, which are informed by theories of social
cooperation, but the direction of relationship with offending remains
unclear. The apparent deficits may reflect adaptation to a hostile
environment where trust and reciprocity are not rewarded. It is also
important to recognise that these community-based offenders did develop
play indicative of trust and reciprocity, they just did so more slowly
than the comparison group. This may have implications for allowing time
for rapport to develop in supervisory relationships. Finally, offenders
may benefit from learning that although more guarded behaviours may be
adaptive in a rough neighbourhood or in jail, they may be maladaptive
and limit their success in other settings such as the work place.

"{Neuroticism is a fundamental personality trait associated with proneness
to feel negative affect. Here we ask how Neuroticism influences the
neural response to positive and negative social interactions and how
Neuroticism modulates the effect of intranasal oxytocin (OT) and
vasopressin (AVP) on the neural response to social interactions. In a
double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 male participants were
randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU AVP or placebo.
Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma Game. On a different day, subjects completed the NEO
personality inventory to measure Neuroticism. Neuroticism was positively
correlated with the neural response to negative social interactions in
the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex and with the
neural response to positive social interactions in the insula,
indicating that Neuroticism modulates neuropsychological processing of
both negative and positive social interactions. Neuroticism did not
modulate the effect of intranasal OT treatment on the neural response to
either positive or negative social interactions. On the other hand, AVP
treatment significantly interacted with Neuroticism to modulate the BOLD
response to both positive and negative social interactions.
Specifically, AVP increased anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal
cortex and lateral temporal lobe responses to negative social
interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring high rather
than low on Neuroticism. AVP also increased the insula response to
positive social interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring
high rather than low on Neuroticism. These results imply that AVP may
increase emotion regulation in response to negative social interactions
and the salience of positive social interactions to a greater extent in
individuals high compared to low in Neuroticism. The current findings
urge caution against uniform clinical application of nonapeptides and
suggest that their efficacy may vary as a function of personality. (C)

"{Altruistic behavior benefits other individuals at a cost to oneself. The
purpose of the present experiment was to study altruistic behavior by
players (P) in 2-person iterated prisoner's dilemma games in which
reciprocation by the other player (OP) was impossible, and this
impossibility was clear to P. Altruism by P could not therefore be
attributed to expectation of reciprocation. The cost to P of altruistic
behavior was constant throughout the study, but the benefit to OP from
P's cooperation differed between groups and conditions. Rate of
cooperation was higher when benefit to OP was higher. Thus altruism (not
attributable to expectation of reciprocation) can be a significant
factor in interpersonal relationships as studied in iterated prisoner's
dilemma games, and needs to be taken into account in their analysis. (C)

"{The theory of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity was examined to help
explain why cooperative video game play can increase players' subsequent
pro-social behaviors. Participants played a basketball video game with a
helpful or unhelpful teammate against an ostensible opposing team.
Participants in the control condition did not play a video game with
their teammate. Participants then engaged in a one-shot simultaneous or
sequential prisoner's dilemma game with their teammate and an opposing
team member. In line with Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, donations to
teammates were influenced by expectations of others to reciprocate
pro-social behaviors. Specifically, playing with a helpful teammate
confirmed expectations of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social
behaviors and led to increases in pro-social behaviors between
teammates. Playing with an unhelpful teammate disconfirmed expectations
of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social behaviors and led to
decreases in pro-social behaviors between teammates. Interestingly,
playing with a helpful teammate increased participants' donation to
out-group members even though participants did not expect them to
reciprocate. The current study emphasizes the importance of pro-social
reciprocity expectations in predicting people's pro-social behaviors and
the impact cooperative video game play can have on such expectations.

"{Background. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder
(BD) have overlapping clinical presentations and symptoms - sources of
persistent clinical confusion. Game-theory can characterize how social
function might be sub-optimal in the two disorders and move the field
beyond the anecdotal description of clinical history. Here, we tested
the hypothesis that BPD and BD can be distinguished on the basis of
diminished reciprocal altruism in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD)
games.
Method. Twenty females with BPD, 20 females with euthymic BD and 20
healthy (non-clinical) females, matched for age and cognitive ability,
were assessed for Axis-I and personality disorders, and completed
psychometric measures of state affect, impulsivity and hostility.
Participants completed two iterated PD games and a test of gaze-cueing.
Results. In the PD games, BPD participants failed to show statistically
stable preferences to cooperate with social partners (playing
tit-for-tat) and made significantly fewer cooperative responses compared
to BD or controls (ANOVA main effect p = 0.03, post-hoc Tukey p < 0.05
for both comparisons). BPD participants were also less likely to sustain
cooperation following experiences involving mutual cooperation than the
other groups. Neither BPD nor BD participants demonstrated impairments
in shifting visual attention on the basis of other peoples' gaze.
Conclusions. These data indicate that BPD is (selectively) associated
with difficulties in establishing, and then maintaining, reciprocal
cooperation, involving altruism. These difficulties are not seen in
euthymic BD. Our data support the differentiation of BPD from BD and
offer fresh insights into the social difficulties experienced by
individuals with diagnoses of BPD.}"
"{Parochial altruism is decomposed in a tendency to benefit the in-group
along with a tendency to ignore, derogate, and harm rivaling out-groups.
Building off recent work suggesting that decisions to cooperate can be
relatively fast and intuitive, we examine parochial altruism in
intergroup conflict when cognitive deliberation is rendered difficult or
not. Predictions were tested in an experiment using an incentivized
Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma Maximizing Differences Game with 95
subjects classified as either pro-social or pro-self being randomly
allocated to high vs. low impulse-control conditions. Results showed,
first of all, that self-sacrificial decisions to contribute were made
faster than decisions not to contribute, and that faster decision time
associated with more positive expectations of in-group members. Second,
we observed that lowering impulse control with a difficult rather than
easy Stroop Task increased the amount contributed to a pool that
benefited in-group members while harming out-group members; thus
reducing deliberation increased parochial altruism. Finally, results
replicated earlier work showing that especially pro-social (vs.
pro-self) individuals contributed more to the in-group and did not lower
their contributions to the between-group pool that benefitted their
ingroup and, simultaneously, hurt the out-group. This pattern emerged
independent of their impulse control. Thus, (in-group bounded)
cooperation is more prominent among individuals with strong rather than
weak other-regarding preferences. Moreover, the intuitive tendency to
cooperate may have evolved in the context of intergroup conflict and
therefore is sharp-edged in-group bounded and including willingness to
aggress out-groups.}"
"{Objective: To evaluate a model that hypothesizes that empathy is
associated with decreased right parietal lobe (RPL)-related
self-orientation (i.e., increased selflessness), which allows
individuals to more easily empathize with others. Methods: Participants:
Thirty one individuals with documented neuroradiological abnormalities
due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) referred for clinical evaluations.
Measures: Cerebral integrity was measured with both functional (i.e.,
neuropsychological tests) and structural indices (i.e., MRI).
Participants were administered comprehensive neuropsychological tests
associated with general bilateral frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe
functioning, a self-report measure of empathy (i.e., Penner's Prosocial
Personality Battery), and an objective measure of empathy (i.e.,
Prisoner's Dilemma). Twenty participants also completed structural MRI
analysis of the bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal, and insular
cortices measured in terms of volume. Results: Pearson correlations
indicated that empathy was related to increased neuropsychological
indices of RPL and frontal lobe (primarily left frontal) functioning.
The only MRI indices associated with empathy were the bilateral insula.
Neither functional nor structural cerebral indices were significantly
related to objective measures of empathy. Conclusions: Contrary to
hypotheses, empathy appears to be associated with increased RPL
functioning. It is suggested that to incorporate the experiences of
others into the experience of the self (i.e., to be empathetic), one
must have an intact sense of the self.}"
"{For a population of interacting self-interested agents, we study how the
average cooperation level is affected by some individuals' feelings of
being betrayed and guilt. We quantify these feelings as adjusted payoffs
in asymmetric games, where for different emotions, the payoff matrix
takes the structure of that of either a prisoner's dilemma or a
snowdrift game. Then we analyze the evolution of cooperation in a
well-mixed population of agents, each of whom is associated with such a
payoff matrix. At each time-step, an agent is randomly chosen from the
population to update her strategy based on the myopic best-response
update rule. According to the simulations, decreasing the feeling of
being betrayed in a portion of agents does not necessarily increase the
level of cooperation in the population. However, this resistance of the
population against low-betrayal-level agents is effective only up to
some extend that is explicitly determined by the payoff matrices and the
number of agents associated with these matrices. Two other models are
also considered where the betrayal factor of an agent fluctuates as a
function of the number of cooperators and defectors that she encounters.
Unstable behaviors are observed for the level of cooperation in these
cases; however, we show that one can tune the parameters in the function
to make the whole population become cooperative or defective.}"
"{In two comprehensive and fully incentivized studies, we investigate the
development of ingroup favoritism as one of two aspects of parochial
altruism in repeated social dilemmas. Specifically, we test whether
ingroup favoritism is a fixed phenomenon that can be observed from the
very beginning and remains stable over time, or whether it develops
(increases vs. decreases) during repeated contact. lngroup favoritism is
assessed through cooperation behavior in a repeated continuous
prisoner's dilemma where participants sequentially interact with 10
members of the ingroup (own city and university) and subsequently with
10 members of the outgroup (other city and university), or vice versa.
In none of the experiments do we observe initial differences in
cooperation behavior for interaction partners from the ingroup, as
compared to outgroup, and we only observe small differences in
expectations regarding the interaction partners' cooperation behavior.
After repeated interaction, however, including a change of groups, clear
ingroup favoritism can be observed. Instead of being due to gradual and
potentially biased updating of expectations, we found that these
emerging differences were mainly driven by the change of interaction
partners' group membership that occurred after round 10. This indicates
that in social dilemma settings ingroup favoritism is to some degree
dynamic in that it is enhanced and sometimes only observable if group
membership is activated by thinking about both the interaction with the
ingroup and the outgroup.}"
"{We analyze the dynamics of repeated interaction of two players in the
Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) under various levels of interdependency
information and propose an instance-based learning cognitive model
(IBL-PD) to explain how cooperation emerges over time. Six hypotheses
are tested regarding how a player accounts for an opponent's outcomes:
the selfish hypothesis suggests ignoring information about the opponent
and utilizing only the player's own outcomes; the extreme fairness
hypothesis weighs the player's own and the opponent's outcomes equally;
the moderate fairness hypothesis weighs the opponent's outcomes less
than the player's own outcomes to various extents; the linear increasing
hypothesis increasingly weighs the opponent's outcomes at a constant
rate with repeated interactions; the hyperbolic discounting hypothesis
increasingly and nonlinearly weighs the opponent's outcomes over time;
and the dynamic expectations hypothesis dynamically adjusts the weight a
player gives to the opponent's outcomes, according to the gap between
the expected and the actual outcomes in each interaction. When players
lack explicit feedback about their opponent's choices and outcomes,
results are consistent with the selfish hypothesis; however, when this
information is made explicit, the best predictions result from the
dynamic expectations hypothesis.}"
"{Hammond and Axelrod use an evolutionary agent-based model to explore the
development of ethnocentrism. They argue that local interactions permit
groups, relying on in-group favoritism, to overcome the Nash equilibrium
of the prisoner's dilemma and sustain in-group cooperation. This article
shows that higher levels of cooperation evolve when groups are dropped
from the model, breaking the link between ethnocentrism and cooperation.
This article then generalizes Hammond and Axelrod's model by
parameterizing the underlying geographical assumptions they make about
the evolutionary environment. This more general model shows that their
findings are sensitive to these assumptions and that small changes to
the assumed geography of reproduction significantly affect the
probabilities of finding ethnocentric behaviors. The model presented
here indicates that it is not local interactions, per se, but settings
where interactions are highly likely to be with close relatives that
lead to ethnocentrism as modeled by Hammond and Axelrod.}"
"{Background. Prosocial emotions related to self-blame are important in
guiding human altruistic decisions. These emotions are elevated in major
depressive disorder (MDD), such that MDD has been associated with
guilt-driven pathological hyper-altruism. However, the impact of such
emotional impairments in MDD on different types of social
decision-making is unknown.
Method. In order to address this issue, we investigated different kinds
of altruistic behaviour (interpersonal cooperation and fund allocation,
altruistic punishment and charitable donation) in 33 healthy subjects,
35 patients in full remission (unmedicated) and 24 currently depressed
patients (11 on medication) using behavioural-economical paradigms.
Results. We show a significant main effect of clinical status on
altruistic decisions (p = 0.04) and a significant interaction between
clinical status and type of altruistic decisions (p = 0.03). More
specifically, symptomatic patients defected significantly more in the
Prisoner's Dilemma game (p < 0.05) and made significantly lower
charitable donations, whether or not these incurred a personal cost (p <
0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Currently depressed patients also
reported significantly higher guilt elicited by receiving unfair
financial offers in the Ultimatum Game (p < 0.05).
Conclusions. Currently depressed individuals were less altruistic in
both a charitable donation and an interpersonal cooperation task. Taken
together, our results challenge the guilt-driven pathological
hyper-altruism hypothesis in depression. There were also differences in
both current and remitted patients in the relationship between
altruistic behaviour and pathological self-blaming, suggesting an
important role for these emotions in moral and social decision- making
abnormalities in depression.}"
"{We study the effect of group size on cooperation in voluntary
contribution mechanism games. As in previous experiments, we study four-
and eight-person groups in high and low marginal per capita return
(MPCR) conditions. We find a positive effect of group size in the low
MPCR condition, as in previous experiments. However, in the high MPCR
condition we observe a negative group size effect. We extend the design
to investigate two- and three-person groups in the high MPCR condition,
and find that cooperation is highest of all in two-person groups. The
findings in the high MPCR condition are consistent with those from
n-person prisoner's dilemma and oligopoly experiments that suggest it is
more difficult to sustain cooperation in larger groups. The findings
from the low MPCR condition suggest that this effect can be overridden.
In particular, when cooperation is low other factors, such as
considerations of the social benefits of contributing (which increase
with group size), may dominate any negative group size effect.}"
"{Social dilemmas are central to human society. Depletion of natural
resources, climate protection, security of energy supply, and workplace
collaborations are all examples of social dilemmas. Since cooperative
behaviour in a social dilemma is individually costly, Nash equilibrium
predicts that humans should not cooperate. Yet experimental studies show
that people do cooperate even in anonymous one-shot interactions. In
spite of the large number of participants in many modern social
dilemmas, little is known about the effect of group size on cooperation.
Does larger group size favour or prevent cooperation? We address this
problem both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, we find
that there is no general answer: it depends on the strategic situation.
Specifically, we find that larger groups are more cooperative in the
Public Goods game, but less cooperative in the N-person Prisoner's
dilemma. Theoretically, we show that this behaviour is not consistent
with either the Fehr \& Schmidt model or (a one-parameter version of)
the Charness \& Rabin model, but it is consistent with the cooperative
equilibrium model introduced by the second author.}"
"{Biotic individuals often compare their own payoffs with those of others,
which results in endogenetic emotions ranging from compassion to
harshness towards a weaker player or from respect to envy feeling
against a stronger fellow. Consequently, the individual reaction can be
a cooperative or defect act. Our paper establishes possible interactions
between emotional characteristics and behaviour modes of individuals.
For this purpose, a genetic algorithm is used to study the evolutionary
process within the framework of a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Our results
highlight that the diversity of emotions can emerge spontaneously that
is fruitful for the general cooperative act. Furthermore, it turned out
that compassion is more important than respect, but both attitudes have
better adaptability than harshness or envy feeling.}"
"{The evolution of cooperation in network-structured populations has been
a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are
embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact
with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering
can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances.
Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no
evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation.
Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to
find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high
level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then
systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one's
neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as
the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c > k, we
observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c <= k
or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are
consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction
forwhen cooperation should succeed on networks and, for the first time
to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of
static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.}"
"{We investigate how cross-cutting ethnic and religious identities as well
as the strength of individual religiosity and fundamentalism affect
individual cooperation. In a repeated prisoner's dilemma experiment,
information about subjects' religious and ethnic identities was either
revealed or concealed to examine the individual and joint effects of
these influences on subject decisions. While subjects' knowledge of
others' religious and ethnic difference has no net effect on their
cooperativeness, the awareness of similarity increases it. Subject
religiosity and fundamentalism have no independent effect on
cooperation, but they enhance ethnic and religious intergroup effects.

"{The persistent deficits in social communication and social interactions
of individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) may impair their
cooperative behaviors. This study investigated the relationship between
social and non-social deficits in children with HFA and the cooperative
behaviors of such children. Theory of mind (ToM), executive function,
and central coherence of children with HFA and typically developing (TD)
children, aged 6-12 years, were investigated, and the effects of these
social and non-social deficits on children's cooperativeness were
examined. The classical prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) and cooperative
implemental tasks were used to assess children's cooperativeness. ToM
was measured using a series of classical false belief tasks and the face
test. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and the Embedded Figures
Test (EFT) were administered to assess executive function and central
coherence, respectively. The results showed that there was no
significant difference in cooperation in PDG between HFA and TD
children, while cooperation in children with HFA in the interruption
period of the implemental tasks was significantly lower than that of TD
children. Children with HFA had social deficits and had more poorly
developed ToM than TD children, and executive function in children with
HFA was poorer than that in TD children. Different types of deficits
were predictive of HFA children's degree of cooperation on different
tasks: the social perceptual component of ToM and executive function
predicted children's cooperativeness in the PDC, and executive function
predicted HFA children's cooperativeness during the interruption period
of an implemental task. By contrast, central coherence did not predict
either of the two types of cooperation. It might indicate that the two
different types of cooperative tasks may require different mental
abilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{The modulating role of age on the relationship between physical
attractiveness and cooperativeness in a prisoner's dilemma game (PDG)
was investigated. Previous studies have shown that physical
attractiveness is negatively related to cooperative choices among young
men but not young women. Following the argument that the negative
relationship between physical attractiveness and cooperation is a
product of short-term mating strategies among attractive men, we
predicted that this relationship is unique to young men and absent among
women and older men. We tested this hypothesis with 175 participants
(aged 22-69 years). The results showed that physical attractiveness was
negatively related to cooperative behavior among young men but not among
women or older men. We further observed that the negative relationship
between physical attractiveness and cooperation among young men was
particularly strong when attractiveness was judged by women. (C) 2014

"{Recently, it has been suggested that people are spontaneously inclined
to cooperate in social dilemmas, whereas defection requires effortful
deliberation. From this assumption, we derive that defection should
entail more cognitive conflict than cooperation. To test this
hypothesis, the current study presents a first application of the
response dynamics paradigm (i.e., mouse-tracking) to social dilemmas. In
a fully incentivized lab experiment, mouse movements were tracked while
participants played simple two-person social dilemma games with two
options (cooperation and defection). Building on previous research,
curvature of mouse movements was taken as an indicator of cognitive
conflict. In line with the hypothesis of less cognitive conflict in
cooperation, response trajectories were more curved (towards the
non-chosen option) when individuals defected than when they cooperated.
In other words, the cooperative option exerted more ``pull{''} on mouse
movements in case of defection than the non-cooperative option
(defection) did in case of cooperation. This effect was robust across
different types of social dilemmas and occurred even in the prisoner's
dilemma, where defection was predominant on the choice level.
Additionally, the effect was stronger for dispositional cooperators as
measured by the Honesty-Humility factor of the HEXACO personality model.
As such, variation in the effect across individuals could be accounted
for through cooperativeness.}"
"{Cooperation in one-shot anonymous interactions is a widely documented
aspect of human behaviour. Here we shed light on the motivations behind
this behaviour by experimentally exploring cooperation in a one-shot
continuous-strategy Prisoner's Dilemma (i.e. one-shot two-player Public
Goods Game). We examine the distribution of cooperation amounts, and how
that distribution varies based on the benefit-to-cost ratio of
cooperation (b/c). Interestingly, we find a trimodal distribution at all
b/c values investigated. Increasing b/c decreases the fraction of
participants engaging in zero cooperation and increases the fraction
engaging in maximal cooperation, suggesting a role for efficiency
concerns. However, a substantial fraction of participants consistently
engage in 50\% cooperation regardless of b/c. The presence of these
persistent 50\% cooperators is surprising, and not easily explained by
standard models of social preferences. We present evidence that this
behaviour is a result of social preferences guided by simple decision
heuristics, rather than the rational examination of payoffs assumed by
most social preference models. We also find a strong correlation between
play in the Prisoner's Dilemma and in a subsequent Dictator Game,
confirming previous findings suggesting a common prosocial motivation
underlying altruism and cooperation.}"
"{Social networks represent the structuring of interactions between group
members. Above all, many interactions are profoundly cooperative in
humans and other animals. In accordance with this natural observation,
theoretical work demonstrates that certain network structures favour the
evolution of cooperation. Yet, recent experimental evidence suggests
that static networks do not enhance cooperative behaviour in humans. By
contrast, dynamic networks do foster cooperation. However, costs
associated with dynamism such as time or resource investments in finding
and establishing new partnerships have been neglected so far. Here, we
show that human participants are much less likely to break links when
costs arise for building new links. Especially, when costs were high,
the network was nearly static. Surprisingly, cooperation levels in
Prisoner's Dilemma games were not affected by reduced dynamism in social
networks. We conclude that the mere potential to quit collaborations is
sufficient in humans to reach high levels of cooperative behaviour.
Effects of self-structuring processes or assortment on the network
played a minor role: participants simply adjusted their cooperative
behaviour in response to the threats of losing a partner or of being
expelled.}"
"{Cooperation norms often emerge in situations, where the long term
collective benefits help to overcome short run individual interests, for
instance in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) situations. Often, however,
there are different paths to cooperation, benefiting different kinds of
actors to different degrees. This leads to payoff asymmetries even in
the state of cooperation, and consequently can give rise to normative
conflicts about which norms should be in place. This norm coordination
problem will be modeled as a Battle of the Sexes game (BoS) with
different degrees of asymmetry in payoffs. I combine the PD and the BoS
to the 3x3 Battle of the Prisoner's Dilemma (BOPD) with several
asymmetric cooperative and 1 noncooperative equilibria. Game theoretical
and ``behavioral{''} predictions are derived about the kind of norms
that are likely to emerge under different shadows of the future and
degrees of asymmetry and tested in a lab experiment. The experimental
data show that game theory fairly well predicts the basic main effects
of the experimental manipulations but ``behavioral{''} predictions
perform better in describing the equilibrium selection process of
emerging norms.}"
"{This study investigates whether cooperation in an indefinitely repeated
prisoner's dilemma is sensitive to the complexity of cooperative
strategies. An experimental design which allows manipulations of the
complexity of these strategies by making either the cooperate action or
the defect action state-dependent is used. Subjects are found to be less
likely to use a cooperative strategy and more likely to use a simpler
selfish strategy when the complexity of cooperative strategies is
increased. The robustness of this effect is supported by the finding
that cooperation falls even when the defect action is made
state-dependent, which increases the complexity of punishment-enforced
cooperative strategies. A link between subjects' standardized test
scores and the likelihood of cooperating is found, indicating that
greater cognitive ability makes subjects more likely to use complex
strategies. Published by Elsevier B.V.}"
"{In social interactions, decision makers are often unaware of their
interdependence with others, precluding the realization of shared
long-term benefits. In an experiment, pairs of participants played an
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma under various conditions involving differing
levels of interdependence information. Each pair was assigned to one of
four conditions: No-Info players saw their own actions and outcomes, but
were not told that they interacted with another person; Min-Info players
knew they interacted with another person but still without seeing the
other's actions or outcomes; Mid-Info players discovered the other's
actions and outcomes as they were revealed over time; and Max-Info
players were also shown a complete payoff matrix mapping actions to
outcomes from the outset and throughout the game. With higher levels of
interdependence information, we found increased individual cooperation
and mutual cooperation, driven by increased reciprocating cooperation
(in response to a counterpart's cooperation). Furthermore, joint
performance and satisfaction were higher for pairs with more
information. We discuss how awareness of interdependence may encourage
cooperative behavior in real-world interactions. Copyright (c) 2013 John

"{Much is known about the affective deficits that characterise
psychopathic traits. However, relatively little research has
investigated psychopathy using paradigms that model social dynamics in
interpersonal contexts. This study examined the association between
psychopathic traits and social cooperation in an iterated prisoner's
dilemma (IPD) paradigm, and tested the impact of affective cues from a
co-player on participant cooperation. A sample of male university
students participated in a block of standard IPD trials (game 1)
followed by a block comprising a novel condition in which participants
were provided with feedback on the emotional state of a bogus co-player
throughout game-play (game 2). Whereas participants with low levels of
psychopathic traits exhibited increased social cooperation in the
context of affective feedback, poor cooperation was uniquely predicted
by high levels of psychopathic traits. Findings are discussed in
relation to recent accounts of psychopathy that emphasise
attention-based mechanisms and empathic dysfunction.}"
"{Homo economicus, a model for humans in neoclassical economics, is a
rational maximizer of self-interest. However, many social scientists
regard such a person as a mere imaginary creature. We found that 31 of
446 residents of relatively wealthy Tokyo suburbs met the behavioral
definition of Homo economicus. In several rounds of economic games,
participants whose behavior was consistent with this model always
apportioned the money endowed by the experimenter to themselves, leaving
no share for their partners. These participants had high IQs and a
deliberative decision style. An additional 39 participants showed a
similar disregard for other people's welfare, although they were
slightly more altruistic than those in the Homo economicus group. The
psychological composition of these quasi-Homo economicus participants
was distinct from that of participants in the Homo economicus group.
Although participants in the latter group behaved selfishly on the basis
of rational calculations, those in the former group made selfish choices
impulsively. The implications of these findings concerning the two types
of extreme noncooperators are discussed.}"
"{Cooperation and competition have emerged as factors that may affect
video game players. Competition consistently has been found to elicit
increased aggression whilst cooperation has been found to mitigate
aggression and increase cooperative behaviors after game play. Of
interest is the effect of the relationship between players (friend vs.
stranger) in cooperative and competitive multiplayer contexts. In this
study, we considered how game goal structure competition or cooperation
and relationships between players friend or stranger affect aggression
and cooperative behaviors. Compared with competition, cooperative play
resulted in significantly more cooperative behaviors in a modified
Prisoner's Dilemma task. However, neither competitive nor cooperative
goal structures significantly increased state hostility, suggesting that
altering players' gaming goals (e.g. competition or cooperation) may not
be enough to elicit strong affective aggression. Additionally,
cooperative game play was found to predict increased cooperative
behaviors and trust in their partner. Implications of the findings are

"{Cooperation is fundamental to the evolution of human society. We
regularly observe cooperative behaviour in everyday life and in
controlled experiments with anonymous people, even though standard
economic models predict that they should deviate from the collective
interest and act so as to maximise their own individual payoff. However,
there is typically heterogeneity across subjects: some may cooperate,
while others may not. Since individual factors promoting cooperation
could be used by institutions to indirectly prime cooperation, this
heterogeneity raises the important question of who these cooperators
are. We have conducted a series of experiments to study whether
benevolence, defined as a unilateral act of paying a cost to increase
the welfare of someone else beyond one's own, is related to cooperation
in a subsequent one-shot anonymous Prisoner's dilemma. Contrary to the
predictions of the widely used inequity aversion models, we find that
benevolence does exist and a large majority of people behave this way.
We also find benevolence to be correlated with cooperative behaviour.
Finally, we show a causal link between benevolence and cooperation:
priming people to think positively about benevolent behaviour makes them
significantly more cooperative than priming them to think malevolently.
Thus benevolent people exist and cooperate more.}"
"{We study the effects of working memory capacity and network rewiring
probability on the evolution of cooperation in the standard and modified
versions of an agent-based model of tag-mediated altruism. In our
evolutionary model, computational agents populate a large complex
network, engage into multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma-like interactions,
and reproduce sexually. Agents carry discernible phenotypic traits
subject to mutation, memorize their own experiences, and employ
different strategies when interacting with different types of
co-players. Choices made are selected from a pool of two conditional and
two unconditional strategies, depending on the available memory contents
and phenotypic similarity among interactors. For the dominating strategy
in our standard model version, we found a strong dependence of
cooperation on network structure and a weak one on memory, whereas in
the modified version, the structural effect was weaker than that of
memory. Most importantly, we found that the previously reported decline
of cooperation in memory-based models, typically observed at a high
memory capacity, is now prevented with the help of tags. This suggests
that the evolutionary advantages of memory capacity limits may be far
more complex than previously assumed. For much smaller systems, we
observed a quasi-symmetric alternation of the two winning groups of
strategists. This result provides an example of ingroup biased
interactions that are characterized by bursts of intra-tag cooperation
interspersed with periods of unconditional transient altruism. Such
switches of strategies may represent a boosting mechanism necessary for
the emergence and stability of global altruism in its early evolutionary
stages.}"

applicable to ingroup and outgroup conflict. Eighty participants were
assigned to play a violent video game cooperatively or competitively
with a confederate posing as an outgroup or ingroup member. The main
findings corroborate previous research on the beneficial effects of
cooperative game play and suggest playing cooperatively can increase
helping behavior. Furthermore, cooperation with an outgroup member can
actually reduce aggression. Implications of findings for future research
are discussed.}"
"{The interactionist approach to the study of exogenous oxytocin (OT)
effects on prosocial behavior has emphasized the need to consider both
contextual cues and individual differences. Therefore, an experiment was
set up to examine the joint effect of intranasal OT, a salient social
cue and the personality trait social value orientation on cooperative
behavior in one-shot prisoner's dilemma games. The outcome of these
mixed-motive games is known to be highly dependent on values and on
social information that might reveal the partner's intent. Consistent
with an a priori hypothesis, OT and social information interact
significantly to affect the behavior of individuals with a proself value
orientation: after prior contact with the game partner, OT enhances
cooperative behavior, whereas in anonymous conditions, it exacerbates
their intrinsic self-interested behavior. These effects of OT do not
hold for individuals with a prosocial value orientation, whose
cooperation levels appear to be more influenced by prior contact with
the game partner. Follow-up hypotheses for why prosocial and proself
individuals respond differently to exogenous OT were developed.}"

"{This study examined the relationship between emotional intelligence
(El), assessed with an ability test, and interpersonal decision-making

individuals who self-report high El tend to cooperate more than others

individuals scoring high on an ability measure of El choose effective
strategies to deal with three different PDG conditions during real
interactions. This suggests that emotionally intelligent individuals are
not rigidly predisposed to cooperate regardless of others' behavior.
Instead, El is associated with the capacity to respond flexibly to
others' strategies and to the interaction context in order to maximize
long-term gains - even when this means competing rather than
cooperating. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"

After making this moral judgment correctly, they were asked to play with
the morally nice and the morally naughty child in a repeated prisoner's

moral judgments, and that HFA children might even have more rigid
criteria for what constitutes morally naughty acts. HFA children's
cooperation did not differ depending on the morality of the interaction
partner, while TD children showed higher cooperation when interacting
with the morally nice than the morally naughty child did. Thus,
partner's morality did influence TD children's but not HFA children's
subsequent cooperation.}"

"{The reliability of human behavior in situations where cooperation is
beneficial for all but is hindered by individual incentives not to

with one partner may affect this subject's behavior when subsequently
matched with a new partner. We extend this knowledge by studying the
development of cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma experiment.
After several rounds, each subject is matched with a new partner. We
analyse whether the interaction outcomes with the first partner lead
subjects to change their behavior when they interact with the second
partner. We focus on niceness as introduced by Axelrod and find
statistically significant effects. Mutual cooperation with the first

"{The present paper analyzes the extent to which attractiveness-related
variables affect cooperative behavior in women. Cooperativeness is
evaluated through a Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). We consider several
morphometric variables related to attractiveness: fluctuating asymmetry
(FA), waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and facial femininity
(FF). These variables have been shown to predict human behavior. We also
include as a control variable a score for self-perceived attractiveness
(SPA). We test differences in these variables according to behavior in
the PDG. Our results reveal that low-FA women cooperate less frequently
in the PDG. We also find that women with lower WHR are more cooperative.
This result contradicts the expected relation between WHR and behavior
in the PDG. We show that this effect of WHR on cooperation operates
through its influence on the expectation that participants hold on the
cooperative intent of their counterpart. In addition, we show that the
effect of attractive features on cooperation occurs independently of the
participants' perception of their own appeal. Finally, we discuss our
results in the context of the evolution of cooperative behavior and
under the hypothesis that attractiveness is a reliable indicator of
phenotypic quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{We explore the extent to which altruism, as measured by giving in a
dictator game (DG). accounts for play in a noisy version of the repeated
prisoner's dilemma. We find that DG giving is correlated with
cooperation in the repeated game when no cooperative equilibria exist,
but not when cooperation is an equilibrium. Furthermore, none of the
commonly observed strategies are better explained by inequity aversion
or efficiency concerns than money maximization. Various survey questions
provide additional evidence for the relative unimportance of social
preferences. We conclude that cooperation in repeated games is primarily
motivated by long-term payoff maximization and that even though some
subjects may have other goals, this does not seem to be the key
determinant of how play varies with the parameters of the repeated game.
In particular, altruism does not seem to be a major source of the
observed diversity of play. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Shame is considered a social emotion with action tendencies that elicit
socially beneficial behavior. Yet, unlike other social emotions, prior
experimental studies do not indicate that incidental shame boosts
prosocial behavior. Based on the affect as information theory, we
hypothesize that incidental feelings of shame can increase cooperation,
but only for self-interested individuals, and only in a context where
shame is relevant with regards to its action tendency. To test this
hypothesis, cooperation levels are compared between a simultaneous
prisoner's dilemma (where defect may result from multiple motives) and a
sequential prisoner's dilemma (where second player defect is the result
of intentional greediness). As hypothesized, shame positively affected
proselfs in a sequential prisoner's dilemma. Hence ashamed proselfs
become inclined to cooperate when they believe they have no way to hide
their greediness, and not necessarily because they want to make up for

the prisoner's dilemma), but it is made more complicated by the fact
that many negotiations involve teams of negotiators. Although it is
widely recognized that the behavior of groups of people can deviate in
important ways from the behavior of individuals, the implications of
this for the negotiator's dilemma are unclear. For this article, I have
used a computer simulation to explore the impact of different decision
rules (majority rule, consensus, and weakest link) on how the approach
of groups to negotiations might differ. The results suggest that the use
of different decision rules can greatly complicate negotiations. While
the majority rule is quite versatile in multiple contexts, a pairing of
weakest link and consensus decision rules is highly problematic for
finding a negotiated settlement.}"
"{Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social
behavior, and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a
potential cause of certain psychiatric disorders that involve social
behavioral deficits. In particular, there is growing interest in
intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric
disorders, and preliminary preclinical and clinical studies suggest
efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the
vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male,
and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of
nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has
investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human
males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of
intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as
they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma
Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human
females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we
find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP
are highly sexually differentiated. In women; AVP increased conciliatory
behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners
more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation
from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects
on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative
interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within
areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in
reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal
forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either
had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in
these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males
more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice
versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to
central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully
characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and
females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application
will be warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"Previous theory and research implies that increasing the size of groups facing resource dilemmas results in poorer outcomes, but no previous study has allowed for communication among group members. The present study relates group size with communication content, task outcomes, and participant perceptions of their experience. With communication, actual group size was irrelevant; to the extent that groups chose to cooperate, outcomes were more equal within groups and participants had more positive perceptions. Greater information exchange and negative maintenance talk was related with less equal outcomes and more negative perceptions; more discussion relevant to specific strategy was associated with more equal outcomes. Findings are instructive concerning the genesis and role of group cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Recent work in neuroeconomics has used game theory paradigms to examine neural systems that subserve human social interaction and decision making. Attempts to modify social interaction through pharmacological manipulation have been less common. Here we show dose-dependent modification of human social behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma model after acute administration of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A modulating benzodiazepine alprazolam. Nine healthy adults received doses of placebo, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg alprazolam in a counterbalanced within-subject design, while completing multiple test blocks per day on an iterated prisoner’s dilemma game. During test blocks in which peak subjective effects of alprazolam were reported, cooperative choices were significantly decreased as a function of dose. Consistent with previous reports showing that high acute doses of GABA-modulating drugs are associated with violence and other antisocial behavior, our data suggest that at sufficiently high doses, alprazolam can decrease cooperation. These behavioral changes may be facilitated by changes in inhibitory control facilitated by GABA. Game theory paradigms may prove useful in behavioral pharmacology studies seeking to measure social interaction, and may help inform the emerging field of neuroeconomics.

"This paper compares the behavior of individuals playing a classic two-person deterministic prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game with choice data obtained from repeated interdependent security prisoner’s dilemma games with varying probabilities of loss and the ability to learn (or not learn) about the actions of one’s counterpart, an area of recent interest in experimental economics. This novel data set, from a series of controlled laboratory experiments, is analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical methods, the first application of such methods in this research domain. We find that individuals are much more likely to be cooperative when payoffs are deterministic than when the outcomes are probabilistic. A key factor explaining this difference is that subjects in a stochastic PD game respond not just to what their counterparts did but also to whether or not they suffered a loss. These findings are interpreted in the context of behavioral theories of commitment, altruism and reciprocity. The work provides a linkage between Bayesian statistics, experimental economics, and consumer psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Previous research on college students has found that cooperation in iterated prisoner's dilemma game is correlated with preference for delayed rewards in studies of temporal discounting. The present study attempted to replicate this finding in a drug-dependent population. Thirty-one individuals who intranasally abuse prescription opioids participated in temporal discounting and iterated prisoner's dilemma game procedures during intake for a treatment study. Rate of temporal discounting was determined for each participant at two hypothetical reward magnitudes, as well as proportion of cooperation in a 60-trial iterated prisoner's dilemma game versus a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game and temporal discounting rates were significantly correlated in the predicted direction: individuals who preferred delayed rewards in the temporal discounting task were more likely to cooperate in the prisoner's dilemma game.

"The prisoner’s dilemma has been used to study self-interest and cooperation in a variety of contexts. Applying an individual differences approach to this paradigm allows for the examination of dispositional factors that predict the likelihood of betraying one’s game partner. An iterative prisoner’s dilemma was administered to undergraduate students, along with measures of demographics, personality, and cognitive ability. Results demonstrate that higher scores on the withdrawal aspect of neuroticism and the enthusiasm aspect of extraversion independently predicted a greater likelihood of cooperation.

"Cooperation has remained one of the main challenges of evolutionary biology. Cooperation can be defined in terms of its economic consequences as a joint action for mutual benefit. Two kinds of cooperation between two individuals may be distinguished selfish cooperation or mutualism and altruistic cooperation. Selfish cooperation occurs when both individuals receive immediate selfish benefits when they cooperate. Altruistic cooperation is costly to the cooperator and beneficial to the recipient in the short term. We focus on the case where the stooge plays TFT, which is a required condition to maintain the subject's cooperation at a high and stable level in experiment. Two main variables describe the situation of a one trial game-unit: the reward of the subject in a given combination and the gain of the subject cooperating after a given combination. The accumulated reward matrix over four trials is no longer a Prisoner's Dilemma matrix but a mutualism one. This matrix corresponds to another game sometimes called 'the stag hunt' and describes how mutualism (and not altruism) can arise in a population. Calculations show that the Prisoner's Dilemma reward matrix is transformed into a mutualism reward matrix, that is, a matrix describing another game, when payoffs are accumulated during four trials.

"The long history of experimental research on the prisoner's dilemma (PD) has primarily used a methodology that eliminates cues to participants. Researchers, however, have interpreted participants' choices as cooperative or competitive. The authors' research shows that giving participants researchers' interpretive labels of the game, the choices, and the outcomes, compared to no labels, led to significantly more cooperation; labels such as trust and cooperate/defect augmented cooperation even more. A second experiment found that independent evaluations of the labels led to perceptions that were similar to individuals' choices in the first experiment. These results suggest that the authors might need to rethink the import of many of their previous findings and their applicability to everyday interactions.

"Researchers in the decision making tradition usually analyze multiple decisions within experiments by aggregating choices across individuals and using the individual subject as the unit of analysis. This approach can mask important variations and patterns within the data. Specifically, it ignores variations in decisions across a task or game and possible influences of characteristics of the subject or the experiment on these variations. We demonstrate, by reanalyzing data from two previously published articles, how a mixed model analysis addresses these limitations. Our results, with a modified Iowa gambling task and a prisoner's dilemma game, illustrate the ways in which such an analysis can test hypotheses not possible with other techniques, is more parsimonious, and is more likely to be faithful to theoretical models.

"Knowledge is currently scarce about what happens in the brain when a decision is made to make a donation. This intriguing donation behavior is often assumed to relate to social relationships. The present study used simulated situations in which participants had to decide how to manage money when possibilities for donation were available. Electroencephalographic signals were recorded while participants were exposed to two cognitive situations, the Dictator’s Game and the Prisoner’s Dilemma, to simulate money exchange between people. Brain activity was measured to determine whether correlations could be made with decisions to donate. Sixty volunteers were assessed, and stimuli were presented randomly. After the presentation of the cognitive tests, the participants were allocated to two groups for the respective cognitive situations. The data showed significant differences in the left prefrontal cortex between questions with a donation context and questions not related to donations. Participants who heard a question related to donation had higher activation in the left prefrontal cortex. These results are consistent with recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, suggesting that greater activation in the prefrontal cortex could be produced by the logical evaluation of dilemmas. These results suggest that logical evaluation occurs when faced with a reasonable donation situation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Are more intelligent groups better at cooperating? A meta-study of repeated prisoner's dilemma experiments run at numerous universities suggests that students cooperate 5–8% more often for every 100-point increase in the school's average SAT score. This result survives a variety of robustness tests. Axelrod [Axelrod, R., 1984. The Evolution of Cooperation. Basic Books, New York] recommends that the way to create cooperation is to encourage players to be patient and perceptive; experimental evidence suggests that more intelligent groups implicitly follow this advice.

"The present experiment introduces a modification of the iterated prisoner's dilemma (PD). In contrast to classical dilemma situations with only one interaction partner, participants (N = 120) interacted with five fictitious interaction partners within one game, either in a random order (change condition) or against each of the interaction partners in succession (block condition). The authors assume that the change condition simulates the social interactions of a real environment more accurately and that individual memory skills are more important in the change condition as compared to the block condition. As dependent variables, the participants' score in the game was recorded, as well as the participants' memory performance concerning information about their interaction partners. Results show that good memory performance with respect to biographical information leads to higher scores only in the condition with changing interaction partners, but not in the block condition.

"In the prisoner's dilemma, self-interest clashes with collective interest. The way players resolve this conflict affects how others view them. Cooperators are seen as more moral than defectors, and, when there is no information about the other player's choice, cooperators and defectors are seen as equally competent. However, players who are defected against are seen as less competent, especially if they themselves cooperated (Experiments 1 and 2). Similarly, cooperators see themselves as more moral, but not as less competent, than defectors do (Experiments 3). Independent of concerns about reputation and self-image maintenance, evidential reasoning contributes to cooperative behavior. Players who project their own attitudes onto others are more likely to cooperate (Experiments 3). Compared with classic game theory, a theory of reputational concerns and evidential reasoning is better equipped to explain empirical patterns of choice behavior in social dilemmas.

"Pre-play discussion consistently increases cooperation in dilemma interactions. Most explanations of this 'cheap-talk' effect are based on either commitment or group solidarity effects. Because discussion about the upcoming dilemma allows participants to make promises and creates group solidarity, the 2 explanations are often confounded. This paper aims to clarify past results by having participants engage in an unrelated discussion prior to a dilemma interaction. We find that solidarity effects can be induced by minimal group categorizations, but are relatively weak. Discussions involving consequential but unrelated coordination tasks are shown to prime cooperative norms and increase cooperation with both in-group and out-group members. Our findings suggest that cheap talk may work for even cheaper reasons than previously thought. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Behavior analytic discussions of self-control have focused on temporal discounting as the primary index of self-control behavior. In this measure, choice between discrete, mutually exclusive, delayed outcomes is observed. The outcome of this self-control measure is well described by hyperbolic models of intertemporal choice. In the last ten years, a second measure of self-control has been developed, the single-player iterated prisoner's dilemma. This measure is based on a series of choices between two discrete outcomes, one of which is larger in the immediate trial, but leads to a lower overall payout while the smaller immediate outcome leads to a higher overall payout. Recent theoretical and empirical reports suggest that while the two self-control measures are unique, the same process modeled by hyperbolic discounting may also influence performance in the single-player prisoner's dilemma. To test this possibility, six experiments compared the correlation between performance on temporal discounting tasks with performance in iterated prisoner's dilemma games. Results from these experiments suggest that: (1) previous reports of a correlation between hyperbolic discounting and performance on the iterated prisoner's dilemma are replicable, but (2) this correlation is not a universal characteristic of these tasks. Rather, the relationship between the two measures is dependent on specific experimental parameters. Further explorations of the necessary parameters found that the relationship between discounting and performance on the iterated prisoner's dilemma is influenced by the type of IPD game, type of discounting task, and the probability of reciprocation used in the IPD game.

"Studies of life span development in everyday problem solving suggest two trajectories of change in adulthood: individuals become less effective at solving well-defined instrumental problems but more effective at managing ill-defined interpersonal problems. Two experiments were conducted to examine the ability of young and older adults to effectively manage an interpersonal problem that has a well-defined measure of instrumental success. Participants played an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game with same-age, computer-simulated strangers (Experiment 1) and friends (Experiment 2). Success was dependent upon one’s ability to put aside self-interest and cooperate with a partner. Computer-simulated partners reciprocated the participants’ decisions 100% of the time or behaved in a more self-interested manner. Young and older adults’ tendencies to create conflict with the reciprocating partner and their defensive reactions to the selfish partner were examined. Although young adults outperformed older adults when playing the game on their own, they did not carry this performance advantage into the interactive rounds. In fact, despite their success when playing alone, young adults were no more successful than older adults when interacting with others. Young and older adults both cooperated more with friends than with strangers and more with the reciprocating partner than the selfish partner. However, when the participants’ first interaction was with a selfish stranger, older adults were more cooperative than young adults and consequently accrued more reward. This is consistent with previous research demonstrating that older adults use more passive interpersonal problem solving strategies than young adults, and it also partially supports the prediction that advancing age leads to more effective strategy implementation when solving interpersonal problems.

"Although many decisions involve a stream of payoffs over time, political scientists have given little attention to how actors make the required tradeoffs between present and future payoffs, other than applying the standard exponential discounting model from economics. After summarizing the basic discounting model, we identify some of its leading behavioral anomalies--declining discount rates; preference reversals; higher discount rates for smaller payoffs than for larger payoffs and for gains than for losses; framing effects based on expectations; and a preference for ascending rather than descending sequences. We examine the leading alternative models of discounting and then apply a quasi-hyperbolic discount model to the problem of cooperation in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games. We demonstrate that if actors display the widely observed tendency to highly discount the immediate future, then cooperation in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game is more difficult than Axelrod suggests.

"In a pairwise interaction, an individual who uses costly punishment must pay a cost in order that the opponent incurs a cost. It has been argued that individuals will behave more cooperatively if they know that their opponent has the option of using costly punishment. We examined this hypothesis by conducting two repeated two-player Prisoner’s Dilemma experiments, that differed in their payoffs associated to cooperation, with university students from Beijing as participants. In these experiments, the level of cooperation either stayed the same or actually decreased when compared with the control experiments in which costly punishment was not an option. We argue that this result is likely due to differences in cultural attitudes to cooperation and punishment based on similar experiments with university students from Boston that found cooperation did increase with costly punishment.

"Subjective expected relative similarity (SERS) is a descriptive theory that explains cooperation levels in single-step prisoner’s dilemma (PD) games. SERS predicts that individuals cooperate whenever their subjectively perceived similarity with their opponent exceeds a situational index, namely the game’s similarity threshold. A thought experiment and 2 experimental studies illustrate and explore SERS’s characteristics, showing that the theory predicts cooperation and competition in single-step PD games under 3 informational structures: (a) clear and transparent similarity cues, (b) experienced similarity, and (c) semantic similarity. The study’s findings suggest that perceived similarity and its application in SERS play an important role in the evolution of cooperation underlying both kin and group selection mechanisms.

Each experimental session involves N subjects and a sequence of indefinitely repeated games. The main treatment consists of whether agents are matched in fixed pairings or matched randomly in each indefinitely repeated game. Within the random matching treatment, we elicit player's strategies and beliefs or vary the information that players have about their opponents. Contrary to a theoretical possibility suggested by Kandori [1992. Social norms and community enforcement. Rev. Econ. Stud. 59, 63–80], a cooperative norm does not emerge in the treatments where players are matched randomly. On the other hand, in the fixed pairings treatment, the evidence suggests that a cooperative norm does emerge as players gain more experience.

"We experimentally investigate the effect of population viscosity (an increased probability to interact with others of one’s type or group) on cooperation in a standard prisoner’s dilemma environment. Subjects can repeatedly choose between two groups that differ in the defector gain in the associated prisoner’s dilemma. Choosing into the group with the smaller defector-gain can signal one’s willingness to cooperate. We find that viscosity produces an endogenous sorting of cooperators and defectors and persistently high rates of cooperation. Higher viscosity leads to a sharp increase in overall cooperation rates and in addition positively affects the subjects’ preferences for cooperation.

"Evolutionary theories of altruism have suggested that reciprocal exchanges and ingroup favoritism have been important strategies leading to the evolution of altruistic behavior among strangers. This study investigates whether minimal information about an interaction partner’s membership in a trivial social group affects the allocations of adults and children in dictator game, reciprocity in a sequential prisoner’s dilemma, and altruistic punishment in a third-party punishment game. In all, 155 adults and 157 students from second and sixth grade played these three economic games in either an ingroup, outgroup, or neutral condition. Adults and sixth-grade children allocated more to ingroup than to outgroup receivers in the dictator game, and adults punished ingroup non-cooperators more in the third-party punishment game than outgroup non-cooperators. When additional information about the other player’s past behavior was presented, adults reciprocated equally with ingroup, outgroup, and neutral players, whereas children from sixth grade reciprocated more with ingroup and neutral than with outgroup players. Overall, the results of this study support the importance of group membership and reciprocity for adults’ and older elementary school children’s altruistic behavior. For younger elementary school children, however, reciprocity and group membership do not serve as salient social information that influence their altruistic behavior.

"Studies of iterated prisoner’s dilemmas (IPD) have shown that agents can escape the social trap of mutual defection by focusing on future gains or by learning from prior experiences. This terrain has been well charted. Yet only recently has attention turned to how groups of agents engage in an IPD scenario against other groups, a scenario that the author dubs 'two-level social traps.' This article investigates the impact of group size on the performance of groups in a two-group IPD based on Michael W. Macy’s STOCHASTIC LEARNING MODEL OF SOCIAL EXCHANGE. The findings of the study suggest that when a democratic (majoritarian) decision rule is used, larger groups perform better in moving from an uncooperative equilibrium to a cooperative equilibrium. The proposed explanation for this is that larger groups reduce uncertainty in the random processes of strategy selection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"People form impressions of others in relation to how trustworthy they are, and let these judgments affect their subsequent behaviour. There is some evidence that people can accurately predict who cooperates in an experimental setting. However, it is unclear what kind of cues lead to correct predictions. This study reports findings of a Prisoner's Dilemma game between pairs of strangers (N=40) and pairs of friends (N=40). It was found that the personality construct of Machiavellianism in the partner predicted perceptions of trustworthiness. People rated high-Machs as less likely to cooperate, but only in pairs of strangers. In addition, duration of eye gaze of a stranger had a positive correlation with predictions of cooperation, but smiling strangers were rated as less likely cooperators. Machiavellianism in strangers was not related to non-verbal communication. It is possible that we have evolved the capacity to detect how Machiavellian a stranger is, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

With controls for personality preferences, we find little evidence of behavioral differences between males and females.

Using a dot probe classification task, we found that, compared to unknown cooperators, attention was oriented significantly more toward the faces of unknown players who decided not to cooperate during a Prisoner's Dilemma Game.

"In accordance with evolutionary models of social exchange, we suggest the possible existence of a limited predictive cheater detection module. This module enables humans, to a certain extent, to predict how willing another might be to cooperate or not. Using unknown target subjects who had played a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game earlier, we asked participants in two experiments to rate how cooperative these target subjects were. Pictures were taken of the target subjects at three different moments: a neutral-expression picture taken prior to the game, an event-related picture taken during the decision-making moment of a practice round, and an event-related picture taken during the decision-making moment of a proper round. We found that participants in the experiments could accurately discriminate noncooperative pictures from cooperative ones, but only in response to those taken during the proper round. In both neutral-expression pictures and practice-round pictures, identification rates did not exceed chance level. These findings leave room for the existence of a predictive cheater detection module that deduces someone's decision to cooperate from event-related facial expressions.

"Previous research has shown an ‘interindividual-intergroup discontinuity effect’: intergroup interactions generally lead to less cooperative outcomes than interindividual interactions. We replicate the discontinuity effect in the deterministic prisoner’s dilemma, but find that groups are more cooperative than individuals in a stochastic version of the game. Three major factors that underlie the usual discontinuity effect are reduced in the stochastic environment: greed, fear, and persuasion power. Two group mechanisms are proposed to explain the reversed discontinuity effect: the motivation to avoid guilt and blame when making decisions that affect others’ welfare, and the social pressure to conform to certain norms when one is in a group setting.

"A recent game theoretic model akin to an iterated prisoner's dilemma explored situations in which 2 individuals (the service providers) interact simultaneously with the same service recipient (the client). If providing a dishonest service pays, then each service provider may be tempted to cheat before its partner, even if cheating causes the client's departure; however, a theoretical cooperative solution also exists where both partners should reduce cheating rates. This prediction is supported by indirect measures of cheating (i.e., inferred from client responses) by pairs of Indo-Pacific bluestreak cleaner wrasses Labroides dimidiatus. Here, we examine how inspecting in pairs affects service quality in Caribbean cleaning gobies Elacatinus spp. We measured dishonesty directly by examining the stomach contents of solitary and paired individuals and calculating the ratio of scales to ectoparasites ingested. We found that the propensity to cheat of females and males differed: females always cleaned relatively honestly, whereas males cheated less when cleaning in pairs than when cleaning alone. However, overall, the cleaning service of single and paired individuals was similar. Our results confirm that cleaners cooperate when cleaning in pairs; however, our findings differ from the specific predictions of the model and the observations on L. dimidiatus. The differences may be due to differences in mating systems and cleaner–client interactions between the 2 cleaner fish species. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Basic social psychological research has suggested several interventions to reduce intergroup conflict. Most of these interventions, however, have been indirect and impractical to implement outside laboratory settings. Although past research has demonstrated that indirect manipulations of the consideration of future consequences reduce intergroup competition, no study of interindividual-intergroup discontinuity has tested this assumption with a direct manipulation. The present study found that when participants (individuals and members of groups) interacting in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) were asked to predict how their opponent's choice on a second trial would be affected by their own choice on an initial trial, intergroup competition was reduced while interindividual competition remained low regardless of the manipulation. On a practical level, implications of this study provide a simple and easily implemented solution to reducing intergroup conflict in non-laboratory situations.

"Men exhibit a stronger tendency to favor the in-group over the out-group compared to women. We examined whether this male-specific 'coalitional psychology' represents in-group love or out-group hate. One hundred thirty-three college freshmen played a prisoner's dilemma game with a member of their own group and a member of another group. Both groups consisted of same-sex participants. An in-group bias (cooperation with the in-group at a level higher than cooperation with the out-group) based on expectations of cooperation from the in-group was observed for both men and women. When such expectations were experimentally eliminated, women did not show any in-group bias, whereas men still exhibited an in-group bias. This male-specific in-group bias was found to be a product of intragroup cooperation (in-group love) rather than a product of intergroup competition (out-group hate). These findings suggest that the male-specific coalitional psychology caters more toward the promotion of within-group solidarity than aggression against the out-group.

Among messengers, we find that employees at firms that pay for performance are significantly less cooperative than those at firms that pay hourly wages or who are members of cooperatives.

"From the Prisoner's Dilemma and other games, it is well known that strategy selection in one-shot games can be very different from that in iterated games. Because exchange structures were studied only as iterated games, whether one-shot structures differ was not known. Nor have exchange theories previously considered whether events in structures would be different if studied as one-shot games. This paper offers new theory to predict one-shot exchange structures and one-shot experiments to test that theory. As predicted, the experiments found that processes and outcomes of one-shot exchange structures are quite different from those of iterated exchange structures. For example, certain relations that are strategically used as threats in iterated exchange structures occur very rarely in one-shot structures. It follows that power differences in one-shot structures regress from those observed for repeated structures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Economic analysis has so far said little about how an individual’s cognitive skills (CS) are related to the individual’s economic preferences in different choice domains, such as risk taking or saving, and how preferences in different domains are related to each other. Using a sample of 1,000 trainee truckers we report three findings. First, there is a strong and significant relationship between an individual’s CS and preferences. Individuals with better CS are more patient, in both short- and long-run. Better CS are also associated with a greater willingness to take calculated risks. Second, CS predict social awareness and choices in a sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Subjects with better CS more accurately forecast others’ behavior and differentiate their behavior as a second mover more strongly depending on the first-mover’s choice. Third, CS, and in particular, the ability to plan, strongly predict perseverance on the job in a setting with a substantial financial penalty for early exit. Consistent with CS being a common factor in all of these preferences and behaviors, we find a strong pattern of correlation among them. These results, taken together with the theoretical explanation we offer for the relationships we find, suggest that higher CS systematically affect preferences and choices in ways that favor economic success.

"Our experimental study compares the effectiveness of three reputation mechanisms believed to enhance cooperation. Groups of 14 subjects repeatedly select partners, play two-person prisoner's dilemmas, and rely only on individual experience to find trustworthy exchange partners in the baseline condition. The local condition represents emergent, bottom-up networks that allow partners to voluntarily share recommendations. The central condition represents designed, top-down institutions that allow wide dissemination of recommendations provided voluntarily. Surprisingly, the greater provision and use of information in the local condition supports the highest level of cooperation, suggesting an unrecognized advantage of exchange networks over centralized institutions in credibility and information provision.

"During behavioral adaptation through interaction with human and nonhuman agents, marked individual differences are seen in both real-life situations and games. However, the underlying neural mechanism is not well understood. We conducted a neuroimaging experiment in which subjects maximized monetary rewards by learning in a prisoner’s dilemma game with two computer agents: agent A, a tit-for-tat player who repeats the subject’s previous action, and agent B, a simple stochastic cooperator oblivious to the subject’s action. Approximately 1/3 of the subjects (group I) learned optimally in relation to both A and B, while another 1/3 (group II) did so only for B. Post experiment interviews indicated that group I exploited the agent strategies more often than group II. Significant differences in learning-related brain activity between the two groups were only found in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for both A and B. Furthermore, the learning performance of each group I subject was predictable based on this STS activity, but not in the group II subjects. This differential activity could not be attributed to a behavioral difference since it persisted in relation to agent B for which the two groups behaved similarly. In sharp contrast, the brain structures for reward processing were recruited similarly by both groups. These results suggest that STS provides knowledge of the other agent’s strategies for association between action and reward and highlights learning competence during interactive reinforcement learning.

"Background: The ability to mentalize, i.e. develop a Theory of Mind (ToM), enables us to anticipate and build a model of the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. It has long been hypothesised that women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2) game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n=12) and women (n=12) interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ, constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the human partner>computer partner contrast. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of participants and the game partner.

"The consistent finding that interactions involving groups are more competitive than interactions between individuals is known as the discontinuity effect. We investigated the effects of group size in order to determine whether the effect is a true discontinuity or a continuous function of group size. We also asked whether dyads behave like larger groups. Four hundred and eighty seven students volunteered for the experiment. Individuals played 10 trials of two-choice prisoner’s dilemmas against other individuals or against groups of sizes two through eight. Major findings included (a) individual–individual interactions were more cooperative than individual–group interactions, but there were no differences among group sizes; (b) dyads were indistinguishable from larger groups; and (c) data on expectations revealed that, before interacting, groups were not only distrusted by individuals but also distrusted the individuals. The discontinuity between individuals and groups—including dyads—appears to be a true discontinuity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Cooperation often fails to spread in proportion to its potential benefits. This phenomenon is captured by prisoner’s dilemma games, in which cooperation rates appear to be determined by the distinctive structure of economic incentives (e.g., $3 for mutual cooperation vs. $5 for unilateral defection). Rather than comparing economic values of cooperating versus not ($3 vs. $5), we tested the hypothesis that players simply compare numeric values (3 vs. 5), such that subjective numbers (mental magnitudes) are logarithmically scaled. Supporting our hypothesis, increasing only numeric values of rewards (from $3 to 300b) increased cooperation (Study 1), whereas increasing economic values increased cooperation only when there were also numeric increases (Study 2). Thus, changing rewards from 3b to 300b increased cooperation rates, but an economically identical change from 3b to $3 elicited no gains. Finally, logarithmically scaled reward values predicted 97% of variation in cooperation, whereas the face value of economic rewards predicted none. We conclude that representations of numeric value constrain how economic rewards affect cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Few interpersonal relationships endure without one party violating the other's expectations. Thus, the ability to build trust and to restore cooperation after a breach can be critical for the preservation of positive relationships. Using an iterated prisoner's dilemma, this article presents two experiments that investigated the effects of the timing of a trust breach—at the start of an interaction, after 5 trials, after 10 trials, or not at all. The findings indicate that getting off on the wrong foot has devastating long-term consequences. Although later breaches seemed to limit cooperation for only a short time, they still planted a seed of distrust that surfaced in the end.

"Vlaev and Chater (2006) demonstrated that the cooperativeness of previously seen prisoner's dilemma games biases choices and predictions in the current game. These effects were: a) assimilation to the mean cooperativeness of the played games caused by action reinforcement, and b) perceptual contrast with the preceding games depending on the range and the rank order of their cooperativeness. We demonstrate that, when playing against choice strategies that are not biased by such factors, perceptual biases disappear and only assimilation bias caused by reinforcement persists. This suggests that reinforcement learning is a powerful source of inconsistency in strategic interaction, which may not be eliminated even if the other players are unbiased and the markets are efficient.

"Distance transcending technology of the Internet generated a new experimental paradigm for the study of intercultural, or joint cultural interaction between members of different societies. University students from Japan, China, and Taiwan participated in experiments involving participants from their own society and another society in real time using an intercultural trust paradigm derived from a game theoretic and evolutionary approach to social exchange. The modified trust game improves on the Prisoner's Dilemma Game by eliminating greed as an explanation for lack of cooperation: the truster unilaterally decides whether or not to trust their exchange partner, and the allocator then decides whether or not to divide the reward fairly between the two of them. Participants earned real money by playing six rounds of one-shot trust games with three in-group members and three out-group members over the Internet. Across three experiments involving two interacting societies each, Japanese were found to be less trusting and trustworthy exchange partners compared to cultural Chinese. This suggests that Japanese collectivism is based more on long-term assurance networks, whereas Chinese collectivism provides a more expansive, guanxi-based approach to building new social networks. Japanese also showed less in-group favoritism in both trust and trustworthiness (or conditional fairness) at the national-level compared to cultural Chinese, suggesting that culture-specific content (e.g., collective guilt for WWII) may influence ethnocentrism at the national level.

"Benefits of forgiveness have been well documented, but past research has not directly addressed the crucial question of whether forgiveness deters or invites repeat transgressions. Our research indicates that expressing forgiveness typically discourages future offenses. In Study 1, participants playing a form of the prisoner's dilemma game were more likely to repeat their transgressions against unforgiving victims than forgiving victims, especially when victims had no chance to retaliate. In response to a hypothetical scenario presented in Study 2, participants reported that they would be less likely to risk offending someone for a second time if that person had forgiven their first offense. In Study 3, participants' autobiographical recollections of their prior transgressions revealed that receiving forgiveness predicted higher repentance motivation.

"We used the experimental no-zero sum Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) to discover the regulatory function of self-esteem and self-efficacy in decision-making in regard to the cooperative and/or competitive behavior. The experimental sample consisted of 80 students from different types of secondary schools between the ages 16-19, AM = 17.00, SD = 1.15, who were administered the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, RSES (Rosenberg, 1965) and General self-efficacy scale, GSES (Jerusalem, Schwarzer, 1981) prior to the PDG implementation. 20 girl and 20 boy dyads, based on a voluntary selection, completed a set of 20 PDG games. We did not discover any significant relation between the selected self system concepts and decision-making in PDG. The result on the significance level p > 0.05 was also determined within the level comparison of L (cooperative)/P (competitive) choice in the whole PDG set between the groups of adolescents with a different level of self-esteem/self-efficacy. In accordance with the L and P choice frequency in the individual games we detected stabilization in the strategy choice during choices 10-19: in persons with high self-efficacy towards cooperation, in persons with low self-efficacy towards competitiveness. The preferred strategy corresponded to the initial choice. Also determined was decision-making stability in adolescents with high self-assessment, and that towards competitive strategy during choices 6-10. On the other hand, persons with low self-esteem level had a tendency to higher risk, and to search for optimal behavior strategy throughout the whole PDG set. We interpret the findings from the viewpoint of social-cognitive theory and conceptual self-esteem determination. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Humans excel at reciprocal altruism in which two individuals exchange altruistic acts to their mutual advantage. The evolutionary stability of this system depends on recognition of and discrimination against non-reciprocators, and the human mind is apparently specialized for detecting non-reciprocators. Here we investigate the neural response to non-reciprocation of cooperation by imaging human subjects with fMRI as they play an iterated Prisoner's dilemma game with two assumed human partners. Unreciprocated cooperation was associated with greater activity in bilateral anterior insula, left hippocampus and left lingual gyrus, compared with reciprocated cooperation. These areas were also more responsive to unreciprocated cooperation than to unsuccessful risk taking in a non-social context. Finally, functional connectivity between anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to unreciprocated cooperation predicted subsequent defection. The anterior insula is involved in awareness of visceral, autonomic feedback from the body and, in concert with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, may be responsible for negative feeling states that bias subsequent social decision making against cooperation with a non-reciprocating partner.

The agents were selected randomly across 1,000 rounds, and interacted with exchange partners according to the moral philosophies noted.

"This study examined patterns of behavioral and emotional responses to conflict and cooperation in adolescents with anxiety/mood disorders and healthy peers. We compared performance on and emotional responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game, an economic exchange task involving conflict and cooperation, between adolescents with anxiety/depressive disorders (A/D) (N = 21) and healthy comparisons (n = 29). Participants were deceived to believe their co-player (a pre-programmed computer algorithm) was another study participant. A/D adolescents differed significantly from comparisons in patterns of play and emotional response to the game. Specifically, A/D participants responded more cooperatively to cooperative overtures from their co-players; A/D girls also reported more anger toward co-players than did comparison girls. Our findings indicate that A/D adolescents, particularly females, respond distinctively to stressful social interchanges. These findings offer a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms underlying social impairment in youth with internalizing disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

There were errors in the original article and the corrections are given in the erratum.] Background: Psychopathy is a disorder involving a failure to experience many emotions that are necessary for appropriate social behavior. In this study, we probed the behavioral, emotional, and neural correlates of psychopathic traits within the context of a dyadic social interaction. Methods: Thirty subjects were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with human confederates who were outside the scanner. Subjects also completed two self-report psychopathy questionnaires. Results: Subjects scoring higher on psychopathy, particularly males, defected more often and were less likely to continue cooperating after establishing mutual cooperation with a partner. Further, they experienced more outcomes in which their cooperation was not reciprocated (cooperate-defect outcome). After such outcomes, subjects scoring high in psychopathy showed less amygdala activation, suggesting weaker aversive conditioning to those outcomes. Compared with low-psychopathy subjects, subjects higher in psychopathy also showed weaker activation within orbitofrontal cortex when choosing to cooperate and showed weaker activation within dorsolateral prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex when choosing to defect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that whereas subjects scoring low on psychopathy have emotional biases toward cooperation that can only be overcome with effortful cognitive control, subjects scoring high on psychopathy have an opposing bias toward defection that likewise can only be overcome with cognitive effort.

"Game harmony is a generic game property describing how conflictual or non-conflictual the interests of players are. Simple and general game harmony measures can predict mean cooperation in 2×2 games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Chicken and trust games. Two measures can be simply computed from monetary payoffs; another, the similarity index, can also be justified by theories of similarity-based reasoning. When data from Oxford and Frankfurt-Oder are disaggregated across experiments, countries and learning history, and when the similarity index is a valid measure, parsimonious regressions can explain around half of the variance in mean cooperation rates.

"An experiment assessed the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) choices of a set of three persons who interacted with another supposed set of three persons. There were four conditions: (1) group-on-group (both three-person sets constrained by a majority vote), (2) group-on-one (only own three-person set constrained by a majority vote), (3) one-on-group (only other three-person set constrained by a majority vote), (4) one-on-one (neither three-person set constrained by a majority vote). The four conditions were compared with three orthogonal contrasts. Consistent with the assumption that interindividual interactions are less competitive than interactions involving groups, the first contrast indicated that there were fewer competitive choices in the one-on-one condition than in the other three conditions pooled. Consistent with the assumption that competitiveness can flow either from acting as a group or interacting with a group, the second contrast found no significant difference between the group-on-one and one-on-group conditions. Finally, consistent with the assumption that the interindividual-intergroup discontinuity effect is a joint function of acting as a group and interacting with a group, the third contrast revealed that there were more competitive choices in the group-on-group condition than in the one-on-group and group-on-one conditions pooled.

For the coordination game, the results revealed a tendency for coordination on the payoff-dominant equilibrium in all three networks, but the frequency of payoff-dominant choices was significantly higher in small-world networks than in local and random networks. For the prisoner's dilemma game, cooperation was hard to reach on all three networks, with average cooperation lower in small-world networks than in random and local networks. Two graph-theoretic characteristics--clustering coefficient and characteristic path length--exhibited a significant effect on individual behavior, possibly explaining why the small-world network, with its high clustering coefficient and short path length, is the architecture of relations that drive a system towards equilibrium at the quickest pace.

"Social discounting measures the amount of money an individual is willing to forgo in order to give money to another person. Seven experiments were conducted to explore the relationship between social discounting and altruistic decision making. In the first two experiments, the amount of money forgone was determined by a hyperbolic function of the social distance between giver and receiver. In the third experiment individual rates of social discounting were compared to individual rates of delay and probability discounting. In Experiment 4 participants gave psychophysical measures of social distance. In Experiment 5 the percentage of cooperation in a single-shot prisoner’s dilemma game was correlated with rates of social discounting. In Experiment 6 the amount of money participants gave to individuals at a given social distance in an ultimatum or dictator game was reduced as social distance increased. In Experiment 7, the participants were more forgiving as the as social distance increased when acting as the receiver in an ultimatum game. The role of social discounting and altruistic behavior is discussed with implications for future applications of the measure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This research investigated how target's facial attractiveness and facial maturity and perceiver's social value orientation (SVO) affected selection of interaction partner, perception of cooperativeness, and actual cooperative behavior in a mixed-motive situation. The physical appearance stereotypes literature has established that target's attractiveness elicits favorable impressions such as sociability, competence and honesty, and that target's babyfaceness elicits impressions such as warmth and incompetence. The SVO literature has shown that prosocials consider cooperation along the dimension of morality or evaluation, whereas proselfs consider cooperation along the dimension of power or potency, and their different goals affect what each thinks constitutes rational behavior. Building on those findings, this study tested the hypotheses that SVO moderates the effect of target attractiveness, but not facial maturity, on perceived cooperativeness; that prosocials cooperate with targets according to their perception of target cooperativeness, but proselfs are not cooperative; and that both prosocials and proselfs' selection preference corresponds to their perception of target cooperativeness. Sixty-four college undergraduates played one-shot prisoner's dilemma games with presumed other participants, who were in reality pre-selected target photographs whose levels of attractiveness and babyfaceness were controlled. Participants selected targets with whom to play the game, decided how cooperative to be by choosing the amount of money to offer, estimated how cooperative the targets had been, and rated targets on trait impressions. Consistent with the hypotheses, prosocials but not proselfs expected more cooperation from attractive targets than from unattractive targets, although only for female targets. Also, both prosocials and proselfs expected more cooperation from babyfaced targets. Contrary to the a priori hypotheses, however, participants cooperated slightly more with attractive targets regardless of their SVO, and chose them more frequently than unattractive targets. Facial maturity did not affect how cooperative participants were, and prosocials chose babyfaced targets more frequently but proselfs chose babyfaced and maturefaced targets similarly often. Overall the results replicated the prior literature on the function of physical appearance stereotypes, while providing limited support for the hypothesized role of SVO as a variable moderating this effect.

"The discontinuity effect is the tendency for intergroup interactions to be more competitive, or less cooperative, than interindividual interactions in the context of mixed-motive situations. Meta-analytic methods have shown this effect to be substantially large and robust (Wildschut, Pinter, Vevea, Insko, & Schopler, 2003). Explanations for the discontinuity effect have focused on norms, schemas, identifiability, and rationalization. Although, personality factors, in general, have received limited attention, Wildschut and Insko (2006) found that dispositional guilt of group members predicted competition in an intergroup prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) but only when group members were told that their decisions would be made public to their fellow ingroup members. The present studies sought to extend these findings by measuring guilt as well as other related personality variables (e.g., shame, empathy, and psychopathy) and assessing their relationships with intergroup competition when decisions remained private (in Study 1) and when decisions were made public (in Study 2). Study 1, in which decisions remained private, showed no relationship between guilt and intergroup competition, whereas Study 2, in which decisions were made public, revealed mixed results.

"Researchers in organizational science often assume a constant environment when studying relationships between organizations. The problem is that this perspective is increasingly difficult to reconcile with the view of organizations as living systems (living organizations) responding to a dynamic environment. The purpose of this research was to understand the effect a dynamic environment has upon a specific type of organization, the network organization - where groups interact cooperatively and pool resources rather than compete in a hierarchical setting. Such an understanding is important for both theoreticians and managers. Using a mixed methodology, the study explored what happens when the assumption of a constant environment is changed to a dynamic environment. Inferential content analysis established the importance of a dynamic environment for understanding organizations as living systems. Using the Prisoner's Dilemma, a computer simulation further evaluated the effects a dynamic environment has on organizational operations. T test comparisons showed that the change from a static to a dynamic environment is essential for the continued development of the concept of living organizations as open systems with the ability to effectively respond to feedback from the surrounding environment. This study strengthens recognition of the network organization as a new type of managerial structure, which reduces the authority of upper level managers and gives employees more responsibility for inter-organizational decision-making. Understanding the effects of a dynamic environment and the benefits of networked organizations may provide managers with the ability to more effectively respond to global challenges.

In the first experiment (n = 78), PD players who had a chance, before they played the game, to think both about the nature of the game they were playing and about their partner's choice were less cooperative compared to players of the standard one-shot PDG. In the second experiment (n = 105), PD players were again less cooperative when they made their decision before they were matched with a particular partner than after they had been matched with a partner. Results strongly suggest the operation of a SEH. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

"{Much evidence exists to support the hypothesis that cooperation improves
performance outcomes for both organizations and individuals. In spite of
this, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential
downstream consequences of asking self-reliant individuals to work and
pursue goals in a team setting, where their success depends heavily on
cooperation and the performance of others. This paper explores these
downstream consequences. Across three studies, our results reveal that
individuals prompted with self-reliance lose significant self-regulatory
capacity after cooperating as opposed to competing individually, which
leads them to act dishonestly (Experiments 1 and 3) and quit a. task
early (Experiment 2). Together, these findings highlight that
cooperation, despite the performance advantages it offers teams, can
also contribute to unforeseen costs for highly self-reliant individuals.}"
"{We study the effects of different punishment institutions on cooperation
in a six-person prisoner's dilemma game in which actors observe others'
cooperation with some noise (i.e. imperfect public monitoring). Previous
research has shown that peer punishment can sustain cooperation, if a
certain proportion of group members punish defectors at a cost to
themselves. However, in the presence of noise, co-operators will
sometimes be mistaken for defectors and punished, and defectors will
sometimes be mistaken for co-operators and escape punishment. Both types
of mistakes are detrimental for cooperation because cooperation is
discouraged and defection is encouraged. By means of a laboratory
experiment, we study whether this adverse effect of noise can be
mitigated by consensual punishment. The more other group members have to
agree on punishing a defector, the less likely will a co-operator be
punished by mistake. We compare a punishment institution in which each
subject decides individually whether to punish another, with
institutions in which punishments are only implemented if subjects reach
sufficient consensus that a particular group member should be punished.
In conditions without noise, we find that cooperation and subjects'
payoffs are higher if more consensus is required before a punishment is
implemented. In conditions with noise, cooperation is lower if more
consensus is required. Moreover, with noise, subjects' payoffs are lower
under all punishment institutions than in the control condition without
punishment opportunities. Our results narrow down the conditions under
which punishment institutions can promote cooperation if such
cooperation is noisy.}"
"{We study, experimentally, how two alternative incentive mechanisms
affect team performance and how a team chooses between alternative
mechanisms. We study a group incentive mechanism (team output is shared
equally among team members) and a hierarchical mechanism (team output is
allocated by a team leader). We find that output is higher when a leader
has the power to allocate output, but this mechanism also generates
large differences between earnings of leaders and other team members.
When team members can choose how much of team output is to be shared
equally and how much is to be allocated by a leader they tend to
restrict the leader's power to distributing less than half of the pie.

"{Groups and organisations set cooperative goals for their members, yet in
reality some team members contribute more than others to these goals.
Experts, in particular, face a social dilemma: from the group's
perspective they should share their knowledge, whereas individually they
are better off not sharing, because acquiring knowledge is costly and
they would give up a competitive advantage. Two experiments (N-1=96,
N-2=192) tested the hypothesis, derived from indirect reciprocity
theory, that experts contribute more if their status is being
recognised. Expert status was manipulated under different performance
feedback conditions and the impact on people's contributions in two
different knowledge sharing tasks was analysed. In both studies, experts
contributed more when feedback was individualised and public, ensuring
both individual status rewards and public recognition. In contrast,
novices contributed more when performance feedback was collective,
regardless of whether it was public or private feedback. Novices did not
have to fear negative performance evaluations under group feedback and
could gain in social status as members of a successful group. Social
value orientation moderated expert contributions in Study 2, with
proself-oriented experts being particularly susceptible to reputation
gains. The studies contribute to the neglected aspect of motivation in

"{We use decision-making experiments with human participants to study
cooperation in a laboratory public goods game. Such games pose a
conflict between cooperating, which is socially optimal and free-riding,

need for de-centralized peer-to-peer punishments as an evolutionarily
stable response to the problem of free-riding, especially where
interactions occur over long horizons. We show that a simple exhortative

"{Social norms are an important element in explaining how humans achieve
very high levels of cooperative activity. It is widely observed that,
when norms can be enforced by peer punishment, groups are able to
resolve social dilemmas in prosocial, cooperative ways. Here we show
that punishment can also encourage participation in destructive
behaviours that are harmful to group welfare, and that this phenomenon
is mediated by a social norm. In a variation of a public goods game, in
which the return to investment is negative for both group and
individual, we find that the opportunity to punish led to higher levels
of contribution, thereby harming collective payoffs. A second experiment
confirmed that, independently of whether punishment is available, a
majority of subjects regard the efficient behaviour of non-contribution
as socially inappropriate. The results show that simply providing a
punishment opportunity does not guarantee that punishment will be used
for socially beneficial ends, because the social norms that influence
punishment behaviour may themselves be destructive.}"
"{We present results from common pool resource experiments designed to
examine the ability of a group of resource users, called insiders, to
simultaneously manage their own exploitation and defend their resource
from encroachment by outsiders. The insiders can use communication, peer
monitoring and sanctions to coordinate their decisions. In addition,
they can sanction any outsiders they observe. We vary the insiders'
ability to observe and sanction the outsiders from no observability to
partial and full observability. We find a striking non-monotonicity
between observability of the outsiders and levels of poaching. Poaching
was higher under partial monitoring than zero monitoring, and was lower
and more stable under full monitoring. Although full observability
allowed the insiders to better coordinate their own harvests, they were
unable to fully deter poaching because their sanctions were far too low
and they were unwilling to punish low levels of poaching. (C) 2017

"{Face-to-face communication drastically increases cooperation rates in
social dilemmas. We test which factors are the most important drivers of
this communication gap. We distinguish three main categories. First,
communication may decrease social distance. Second, communication may
enable subjects to assess their opponent's cooperativeness ({''}type
detection{''}) and condition their own action on that information.
Third, communication allows subjects to make promises, which create
commitment for subjects who do not want to break a promise. We find that
communication increases cooperation very substantially. In our
experiment, we find that commitment value is an important factor, but
the largest part of the increase can be attributed to type detection. We
do not find evidence that social distance plays a role.}"
"{This paper investigates how communication in a particular language
affects decision making in social interactions and risk preferences. We
test two competing hypotheses: the cognitive accessibility hypothesis,
and the expectation-based hypothesis. The cognitive accessibility
hypothesis argues that communication in a particular language will
activate the underlying cultural frame and affect behavior. The
expectation-based hypothesis argues that different languages will induce
different expectations regarding the choices of others and affect
behavior. We test these two hypotheses using an extensive range of
behaviors in a set of incentivized experiments with bilingual subjects
in Chinese and English. We find that the subjects are more prosocial in
strategic interaction games (trust games) when the experiments are
conducted in Chinese. However, no treatment effects are observed in the
individual choice games on social preference. The results are more in
line with the expectation-based hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

"{Many common pool resources (CPRs) have tipping points stock levels below
which the resource is permanently damaged or destroyed but the specific
levels at which these thresholds are crossed are rarely known with
certainty. We model a CPR in which uncertainty simultaneously creates a
Prisoner's Dilemma and a Coordination Game. This model highlights a
novel mechanism through which uncertainty incentivizes the overuse of a
CPR. In the model, two Nash Equilibria exist, both of which lead to a
Tragedy of the Commons, but one is an inferior solution because it leads
to assured resource destruction. We use a single-period laboratory
experiment to investigate the effects of uncertain tipping points on
constituents' resource extraction decisions. Experimental results
suggest that uncertainty reduces coordination in this type of CPR
setting and increases the likelihood of resource destruction. We also
find that tax and fine policies reduce consumption rates and prevent
resource destruction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{This paper addresses the evolution of cooperation in a multi-agent
system with agents interacting heterogeneously with each other based on
the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game. The heterogeneity of
interaction is defined in two models. First, agents in a network are
restricted to interacting with only their neighbors (local interaction).
Second, agents are allowed to adopt different IPD strategies against
different opponents (discriminative interaction). These two
heterogeneous interaction scenarios are different to the classical
evolutionary game, in which each agent interacts with every other agent
in the population by adopting the same strategy against all opponents.
Moreover, agents adapt their risk attitudes while engaging in
interactions. Agents with payoffs above (or below) their aspirations
will become more risk averse (or risk seeking) in subsequent
interactions, wherein risk is defined as the standard deviation of
one-move payoffs in the IPD game. In simulation experiments with agents
using only own historical payoffs as aspirations (historical
comparison), we find that the whole population can achieve a high level
of cooperation via the risk attitude adaptation mechanism, in the cases
of either local or discriminative interaction models. Meanwhile, when
agents use the population's average payoff as aspirations (social
comparison) for adapting risk attitudes, the high level of cooperation
can only be sustained in a portion of the population (i.e., partial
cooperation). This finding also holds true in both of the heterogeneous
scenarios. Considering that payoffs cannot be precisely estimated in a
realistic IPD game, simulation experiments are also conducted with a
Gaussian disturbance added to the game payoffs. The results reveal that
partial cooperation in the population under social comparison is more
robust to the variation in payoffs than the global cooperation under
historical comparison.}"
"{Does it matter whether contribution decisions regarding environmental
public goods are arrived at through intuition or reflection?
Experimental research in behavioral economics has recently adopted
dual-system theories of the mind from psychology in order to address
this question. This research uses response time data in public good
games to distinguish between the two distinct cognitive processes. We
extend this literature towards environmental public goods by analyzing
response time data from an online experiment in which over 3400 subjects
from the general population faced a dichotomous choice between receiving
a monetary payment or contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.
Our evidence confirms a strong positive link between response times and
contributions: The average response time of contributors is 40 \% higher
than that of non-contributors. This suggests that reflection, not
intuition, is at the root of pro-environmental contributions. This
result is robust to a comprehensive set of robustness checks, including
a within-subjects analysis that controls for potentially unobserved
confounds and recovers the relationship at the individual level.}"
"{Explanations for cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma games have generated
significant interest. While institutional explanations have offered
considerable explanatory ability, a psychological measure of Theory of
the Mind that measures an individual's ability to process social and
emotional cognition offers new insights. Using this measure, we examine
how it explains (un)cooperative behavior. We find that subjects who have
higher ToM are less cooperative and extract higher payoffs. (C) 2017

"{We investigate the dynamics of individual pro-social behavior over time.
The dynamics are tested by running the same experiment with the same
subjects at several points in time. To exclude learning and reputation
building, we employ non-strategic decision tasks and a sequential
prisoners-dilemma as a control treatment. In the first wave, pro-social
concerns explain a high share of individual decisions. Pro-social
decisions decrease over time, however. In the final wave, most decisions
can be accounted for by assuming pure selfishness. Stable behavior in
the sense that subjects stick to their decisions over time is observed
pre-dominantly for purely selfish subjects. We offer two explanation for
our results: diminishing experimenter demand effects and moral
self-licensing.}"
"{Earlier studies have found that framing has a substantial impact on the
degree of cooperation observed in public good experiments. We show that
the way the public good game is framed affects misperceptions about the
incentives of the game. Moreover, we show that such framing-induced
differences in misperceptions are linked to the framing effect on
subjects' cooperation behavior. When we do not control for the different
levels of misperceptions between frames, we observe a significant
framing effect on subjects' cooperation preferences. However, this
framing effect becomes insignificant once we remove subjects who
misperceive.}"
"{Dynamic networks have been shown to increase cooperation, but prior
findings are compatible with two different mechanisms for the evolution
of cooperation. It may be that dynamic networks promote cooperation even
in networks composed entirely of egoists, who strategically cooperate to
attract and maintain profitable interaction partners. Alternatively,
drawing on recent insights into heterogeneous social preferences, we
expect that dynamic networks will increase cooperation only when nodes
are occupied by persons with more prosocial preferences, who tend to
attract and keep more cooperative partners relative to egoists. Our
experiment used a standard procedure to classify participants a priori
as egoistic or prosocial and then embedded them in homogeneous networks
of all prosocials or all egoists, or in heterogeneous networks (50/50).
Participants then interacted in repeated prisoner's dilemma games with
alters in both static and dynamic networks. In both heterogeneous and
homogeneous networks, we find dynamic networks only promote cooperation
among prosocials. Resulting from their greater cooperation, prosocials'
relations are more stable, yielding substantially higher fitness
compared to egoists in both heterogeneous and homogeneous dynamic
networks. Our results suggest that a key to the evolution and stability
of cooperation is the ability of those with prosocial preferences to
alter their networks.}"
"{One of the most elusive scientific challenges for over 150 years has
been to explain why cooperation survives despite being a seemingly
inferior strategy from an evolutionary point of view. Over the years,
various theoretical scenarios aimed at solving the evolutionary puzzle
of cooperation have been proposed, eventually identifying several
cooperation-promoting mechanisms: kin selection, direct reciprocity,
indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. We
report the results of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma experiments with
anonymous and onymous pairwise interactions among individuals. We find
that onymity significantly increases the frequency of cooperation and
the median payoff per round relative to anonymity. Furthermore, we also
show that the correlation between players' ranks and the usage of
strategies (cooperation, defection, or punishment) underwent a
fundamental shift, whereby more prosocial actions are rewarded with a
better ranking under onymity. Our findings prove that reducing anonymity
is a valid promoter of cooperation, leading to higher payoffs for
cooperators and thus suppressing an incentive-anonymity-that would
ultimately favor defection.}"
"{The threat of free-riding makes the marshalling of cooperation from
group members a fundamental challenge of social life. Where classical
social science theory saw the enforcement of moral boundaries as a
critical way by which group members regulate one another's self-interest
and build cooperation, moral judgments have most often been studied as
processes internal to individuals. Here we investigate how the
interpersonal expression of positive and negative moral judgments
encourages cooperation in groups and prosocial behavior between group
members. In a laboratory experiment, groups whose members could make
moral judgments achieved greater cooperation than groups with no
capacity to sanction, levels comparable to those of groups featuring
costly material sanctions. In addition, members of moral judgment groups
subsequently showed more interpersonal trust, trustworthiness, and
generosity than all other groups. These findings extend prior work on
peer enforcement, highlighting how the enforcement of moral boundaries
offers an efficient solution to cooperation problems and promotes
prosocial behavior between group members.}"
"{Sustainability has become a key issue in managing natural resources
together with growing concerns for capitalism, environmental and
resource problems. We hypothesize that the ongoing modernization of
competitive societies, which we refer to as ``capitalism,{''} affects
human nature for utilizing common pool resources, thus compromising
sustainability. To test this hypothesis, we design and implement a set
of dynamic common pool resource games and experiments in the following
two types of Nepalese areas: ( i) rural ( non-capitalistic) and ( ii)
urban ( capitalistic) areas. We find that a proportion of prosocial
individuals in urban areas is lower than that in rural areas, and urban
residents deplete resources more quickly than rural residents. The
composition of proself and prosocial individuals in a group and the
degree of capitalism are crucial in that an increase in prosocial
members in a group and the rural dummy positively affect resource
sustainability by 65\% and 63\%, respectively. Overall, this paper shows
that when societies move toward more capitalistic environments, the
sustainability of common pool resources tends to decrease with the
changes in individual preferences, social norms, customs and views to
others through human interactions. This result implies that individuals
may be losing their coordination abilities for social dilemmas of
resource sustainability in capitalistic societies.}"
"{It is well proven that communication enhances cooperation in public
goods and common-pool resource experiments. It is less well understood
why and how communication affects cooperative behavior and whether that
impact is mediated by the sharing of a common context and the
individuals' every day experiences. This paper aims to close this gap by
means of a systematic content analysis of communication transcripts from
field experiments. The paper analyzes communication statements shared by
participants in a series of common-pool resource experiments conducted
in rural Colombia. We first classified each statement under two
categories: topic and function. Then, we tested hypotheses about the
impact of those statements on cooperation depending on (1) their
reference to the ``field context{''} and other topic categories; and (2)
the ``informational{''}, ``disapproval{''}, or ``group solidarity{''}
function of the statements. According to our results, statements that
contain references to the context affect cooperation depending on the
function of those statements. When the statements fulfill an information
role, the effect is negative, but when statements have the function of
enhancing group solidarity, the effect is positive. The statements that
have the strongest positive impact on cooperation are those fulfilling a
disapproval function, particularly when the topic of the messages are
the payoffs obtained by the group. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}"
"{In an experiment we investigate preferences for allocation of a public
good among group members who contributed unequally in providing the
public good. Inducing the group goal of productivity resulted in
preferences for equitable allocations, whereas inducing the group goals
of harmony and social concern resulted in preferences for equal final
outcomes. The study makes a contribution by simultaneously treating
provision and allocation of a public good, thus viewing these as related
processes. Another contribution is that a new paradigm is introduced
that bears closer resemblance to real life public good dilemmas than
previous research paradigms do.}"
"{To expand upon perspectives on the commons dilemma, we developed an
online experiment grounded in David Seibold and colleagues'
structurational perspective on group decision-making. We created
manipulations based on three modalities of structure: dense versus
sparse networks (domination), collective versus individual identity
(signification), and social sanction versus non-social sanction
(legitimation). The results revealed that modalities of signification
positively influence contribution rates when participants were
communicated information meant to stimulate a collective identity. In
contrast to our hypotheses, individuals contributed more in sparse,
rather than dense network structures. For managers of public goods, our
results suggest that communication that emphasizes common identity may
be important for mobilizing collective action and that they should also
pay special attention to communication overload.}"
"{Purpose - Due to the non-rivalrous and non-excludable characteristics of
properties classified as being part of the cultural heritage of a city,
owners of these properties face a lower incentive to maintain them. Many
studies have advocated the participation of the local community in the
maintenance of such ``public{''} properties because community demands
and tastes are better reflected through direct participation than
through government intervention. One of the main factors that may
determine whether or not such participation would be forthcoming is
whether the community identifies with elements that the cultural
heritage building represents. The purpose of this paper is to examine
the cultural effects of the Chinese community with regard to the
preservation of the heritage buildings that reflect the community's
early presence in George Town, Penang.
Design/methodology/approach - An experimental method was used to invoke
feelings of social identity through historical and cultural photos about
these buildings associated with the community. The authors attempted to
create an emotional attachment to the cultural and historical values in
a laboratory.
Findings - The authors found that information increased the
participants' positive feelings toward their historical and cultural
backgrounds. This positive emotion might explain why the subjects
appeared more willing to contribute to the public pool to maintain these
buildings. The findings suggest that the incorporating cultural and
historical information about heritage buildings may encourage more
pro-social behaviors.
Social implications - Although community participation and discussions
can help to align the conservation objectives of diverse stakeholders,
the divergence between individual and collective interests may cause
individuals to shirk from their commitment, given the public nature of
the goods. Therefore, investigating whether a factor that aligns diverse
interests or the nature of the game can influence behavior is important
to the development of strategies used in the provision of public good.
Originality/value - Although the impact of social identity on social
dilemma has been widely studied, the empirical proof and its application
to preservation of cultural heritage has not been studied. As far as the
authors know, this is the first paper that experimentally proves the
importance of social identity and its role in provision of social goods.}"
"{Models of reciprocity imply that cheater detection is an important
prerequisite for successful social exchange. Considering the fundamental
role of memory in reciprocal exchange, these theories lead to the
prediction that memory for cheaters should be preferentially enhanced.
Here, we examine whether information of a partner's previous behaviour
in an interaction is automatically retrieved when encountering the face
of a partner who previously cheated or cooperated. In two studies,
participants played a sequential prisoner's dilemma game with cheaters
and cooperative partners. Alternating with the game blocks, participants
were asked to classify the smiling or angry facial expressions of
cooperators and cheaters. Both experiments revealed congruence effects,
reflecting faster identification of the smiles of cooperators
(Experiments 1 and 2) and faster identification of the angry facial
expressions of cheaters (Experiment 2). Our study provides evidence for
the automatic retrieval of the partner's behaviour in the game,
regardless of whether partners cheated or cooperated, and thus provides
further evidence against the cheater detection hypothesis.}"
"{Economics and business students regularly behave less prosocially than
others. Can ethics training reverse this tendency? Results from a
repeated public goods experiment reveal that it can. Students who attend
an interactive lecture on social dilemmas show significantly more
cooperation than others. However, the lecture does not appear to
increase the incidence of reciprocal behavior. As many current social
problems qualify as social dilemmas, this result stresses the importance
of ethics training for policy makers and curriculum designers alike in
overcoming the incentive structure of social dilemmas.}"
"{We extend the recent experimental literature on incomplete punishment
networks in linear public goods games. In these games, we use an
exogenous network to restrict both monitoring and the set of feasible
punishment flows. In addition to two baseline structures (the Complete
network and the Circle network), we examine a novel Asymmetric network
in which both punishment responsibility and exposure differ across
players. Average contributions are significantly lower in the Asymmetric
network, driven entirely by the under-monitored player who faces only
one potential punisher. We formulate and examine the hypothesis that
asymmetry among a player's potential punishment targets may lead to
discriminatory patterns of punishment. In particular, players might wish
to punish targets for whom they are solely responsible discriminately
more than targets for whom they share responsibility. The experimental
data do not support this hypothesis, although they do suggest a
compelling explanation as to why. Specifically, we find that the under
monitored player in the network retaliates against previous punishment
significantly more often than others in the group, which deters their
only potential punisher from issuing stronger sanctions. Thus, an
additional complication of asymmetry in the network is that it may lead
to more instances of anti-social retaliation, inhibiting the
effectiveness of the decentralized punishment institution. (C) 2016

"{We investigate experimentally if endogenous partnership formation
improves efficiency in social dilemmas. Subjects play multiple
two-player public-goods games, where they can break up with their
partner periodically. A stable-marriage mechanism based on rankings
provided by singles determines the new matches. We vary the information
subjects have on possible matches and whether staying in a partnership
leads to a cost or a bonus. We find that endogenous group formation can
increase efficiency. Both the provision of contribution history and
bonuses have positive effects. At least one of these factors is required
for efficiency improvements. The presence of both leads to the best
results.}"
"{Cooperation theories assume that interacting individuals can change
their strategies under different expected payoffs, depending on their
social status or social situations. When looking at sex differences in
cooperation, the existing studies have found that the genders cooperate
at similar frequencies. However, the majority of the data originate
within Western human societies. In this paper, we explore whether there
are gender differences in cooperation in China. An Iterated Prisoner's
Dilemma game with a punishment option was used to gather data about
Southwest Chinese subjects in a culture in which men have a hierarchical
advantage over women. Results indicate that men invested into partners
significantly more than women did (34\% male vs. 24\% female) while
women, in turn, were more likely to defect (65\% female vs. 50\% male).
In this region, women have customarily held less economic power and they
are used to obtain a payoff typically lower than men. We suggest that
the women's willingness to invest in cooperation has decreased
throughout evolutionary time, providing us with an illustration of a
culturally-driven shift towards a disparity in gender cooperation
interests.}"
"{The studies described in this article explore the influence of an
under-emphasized determinant of cooperative behavior in social dilemmas:
affected third parties. Two experiments examined the effect of
characteristics of third parties on individual cooperative behavior in
social dilemmas, and identified mechanisms associated with these
relationships. Study 1 demonstrated that third-party need affects
individual cooperative behavior, and tested prosocial motivation and
intra-group trust as mediators of this relationship. Study 2 provided
further elaboration by demonstrating that individual cooperative
behavior was reduced when a needy third party was low on reliability,
and by showing that prosocial motivation and intra-group trust mediated
this relationship. This research connects the literatures on individual
cooperation in social dilemmas and relational job design, and
demonstrates why third parties influence individuals' cooperative
behavior.}"
"{We investigate the effect of gender composition on the group dynamics of
microfinance clients in Tanzania using a laboratory experiment. We focus
on three dimensions: (i) the ability to collaborate on problem-solving,
(ii) joint decision-making in risk taking, and (iii) the willingness to
cooperate in a public-goods game. Our main finding is that female groups
are better at collaborating in problem-solving than male and mixed
groups, and are also more willing to take risks. However, in the
public-goods game we find no robust evidence of female groups
contributing more than male and mixed groups. Our findings suggest that
one reason why female loan groups often have higher repayment rates than
male and mixed groups may be that female groups are more able to
collaborate and find common solutions to common challenges. (C) 2016

"{We study the role of village-level religious fragmentation on intra- and
inter-group cooperation in India. We report on data on two-player
prisoners' dilemma and stag hunt experiments played by 516 Hindu and

the two players and the degree of village-level religious heterogeneity.
In religiously heterogeneous villages, cooperation rates in the
prisoners' dilemma, and to a lesser extent the stag hunt game, are
higher when subjects of either religion play with a fellow in-group
member than when they play with an out-group member or with someone
whose identity is unknown. Interestingly, cooperation rates among people
of the same religion are significantly lower in homogeneous villages

"{Direct reciprocity is a major mechanism for the evolution of
cooperation. Several classical studies have suggested that humans should
quickly learn to adopt reciprocal strategies to establish mutual
cooperation in repeated interactions. On the other hand, the recently
discovered theory of ZD strategies has found that subjects who use
extortionate strategies are able to exploit and subdue cooperators.
Although such extortioners have been predicted to succeed in any
population of adaptive opponents, theoretical follow-up studies
questioned whether extortion can evolve in reality. However, most of
these studies presumed that individuals have similar strategic
possibilities and comparable outside options, whereas asymmetries are
ubiquitous in real world applications. Here we show with a model and an
economic experiment that extortionate strategies readily emerge once
subjects differ in their strategic power. Our experiment combines a
repeated social dilemma with asymmetric partner choice. In our main
treatment there is one randomly chosen group member who is unilaterally
allowed to exchange one of the other group members after every ten
rounds of the social dilemma. We find that this asymmetric replacement
opportunity generally promotes cooperation, but often the resulting
payoff distribution reflects the underlying power structure. Almost half
of the subjects in a better strategic position turn into extortioners,
who quickly proceed to exploit their peers. By adapting their
cooperation probabilities consistent with ZD theory, extortioners force
their co-players to cooperate without being similarly cooperative
themselves. Comparison to non-extortionate players under the same
conditions indicates a substantial net gain to extortion. Our results
thus highlight how power asymmetries can endanger mutually beneficial
interactions, and transform them into exploitative relationships. In
particular, our results indicate that the extortionate strategies
predicted from ZD theory could play a more prominent role in our daily
interactions than previously thought.}"
"{We study whether and how payment procedure affects behavior in a
repeated public good game. To this end, we conducted five treatments,
varying the times of paying the initial endowment (week before, before,
or after the decisions) and the source of the initial endowment
(windfall vs. earned money in a real-effort task). We find little
evidence for effects of tangible endowment, windfall endowment, or
prepaid endowment. However, we observe that payment procedures do
influence decisions in a repeated public good game experiment.}"
"{We observe each subject in laboratory public good experiments and in one
of three treatments of a field experiment. These treatments differ with
respect to the presence or absence of a social dilemma. With the social
dilemma present in the field, subjects who contribute less in the
laboratory provide less effort. Selecting individuals according to
laboratory contribution increases productivity as much as selecting on
ability. This correlation disappears in the two treatments without a
social dilemma. We conclude that we can use laboratory experiments to
learn about behaviour in situations that share the game form but not
necessarily the frame. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Despite the repeatedly raised criticism that findings in economic games
are specific to situations involving trivial incentives, most studies
that have examined the stake-size effect have failed to find a strong
effect. Using three prisoner's dilemma experiments, involving 479
non-student residents of suburban Tokyo and 162 students, we show here
that stake size strongly affects a player's cooperation choices in
prisoner's dilemma games when stake size is manipulated within each
individual such that each player faces different stake sizes.
Participants cooperated at a higher rate when stakes were lower than
when they were higher, regardless of the absolute stake size. These
findings suggest that participants were `moral bargain hunters' who
purchased moral righteousness at a low price when they were provided
with a `price list' of prosocial behaviours. In addition, the moral
bargain hunters who cooperated at a lower stake but not at a higher
stake did not cooperate in a single-stake one-shot game.}"
"{In a networked society like ours, reputation is an indispensable tool to
guide decisions about social or economic interactions with individuals
otherwise unknown. Usually, information about prospective counterparts
is incomplete, often being limited to an average success rate.
Uncertainty on reputation is further increased by fraud, which is
increasingly becoming a cause of concern. To address these issues, we
have designed an experiment based on the Prisoner's Dilemma as a model
for social interactions. Participants could spend money to have their
observable cooperativeness increased. We find that the aggregate
cooperation level is practically unchanged, i.e., global behavior does
not seem to be affected by unreliable reputations. However, at the
individual level we find two distinct types of behavior, one of reliable
subjects and one of cheaters, where the latter artificially fake their
reputation in almost every interaction. Cheaters end up being better off
than honest individuals, who not only keep their true reputation but are
also more cooperative. In practice, this results in honest subjects
paying the costs of fraud as cheaters earn the same as in a truthful
environment. These findings point to the importance of ensuring the
truthfulness of reputation for a more equitable and fair society.}"
"{Previous experimental studies suggest that cooperation in one-shot
anonymous interactions is, on average, spontaneous, rather than
calculative. To explain this finding, it has been proposed that people
internalize cooperative heuristics in their everyday life and bring them
as intuitive strategies in new and atypical situations. Yet, these
studies have important limitations, as they promote intuitive responses
using weak time pressure or conceptual priming of intuition. Since these
manipulations do not deplete participants' ability to reason completely,
it remains unclear whether cooperative heuristics are really automatic
or they emerge after a small, but positive, amount of deliberation.
Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we report two experiments
demonstrating that spontaneous reactions in one-shot anonymous
interactions tend to be egoistic. In doing so, our findings shed further
light on the cognitive underpinnings of cooperation, as they suggest
that cooperation in one-shot interactions is not automatic, but appears
only at later stages of reasoning.}"
"{In a laboratory experiment we study how costly punishment behavior of
second and third parties in a social dilemma situation is affected by
monitoring costs. Subjects have to pay a fee over and above punishment
costs if they wish to condition punishments on previous play, which is
equivalent to a binary choice between the acquisition of perfect
information on the target subject's behavior and no information at all.
When monitoring is costly both second and third party punishment is
weaker and less discriminate and hence generates weaker incentives for
cooperation than when monitoring is free. There are subtle differences
between second and third parties: The presence of monitoring costs leads
subjects to withhold sanctioning more often as second parties than as
third parties, and to punish indiscriminately more often as third
parties than as second parties. The results contribute to the
understanding of peer-enforcement of cooperation in social dilemmas and
whether there is a common motivational structure underpinning second and
third party punishment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Play in standard laboratory Public Good games suggests that on average,
humans are quite prone to cooperate. Yet cooperation is often absent in
real world social dilemmas, including many environmental problems. We
propose that this discrepancy arises because in the Public Good game,
the worst freeriders can do is to not contribute to the public account,
while in many real world environmental situations freeriders can even
appropriate contributions made by others before the public good is
produced. We introduce the Claim Game that modifies the Public Good game
by allowing for appropriating the contributions of others before the
public good is produced. The impact of such possible takings on public
good production is dramatic. No public good is produced, not even in the
initial stages of interaction, We link our findings to the relevance of
common pool games for modeling environmental problems, and stress the
need to experimentally test environmental institutions within harsher
social dilemmas than the standard Public Good game. (C) 2015 Elsevier

"{The existing results from literature on preferences over sanctions in
social dilemmas are inconclusive. Our experimental setup allows us to
study both preferences over punishment and reward mechanisms and
preferences over their levels of effectiveness. We show that the
voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM) with reward is the most favored
and the most efficient institution, although the VCM with punishment
leads to higher contributions. Subjects prefer extreme values of the
sanctioning technologies, and contributions increase in the level of
effectiveness. There is no difference in the voting pattern between a
partner- and a stranger-matching treatment. (JEL: C72, C91, C92)}"
"{This paper bridges insights from theories of collective action, power,
and influence to address the conditions under which group leaders solve
collective action problems. We show how leaders' behaviors impact the
success of collective action groups as a whole via both power and
influence processes. In a laboratory experiment, groups first completed
a baseline measure of cooperation in a public good dilemma without
punishment. In a second phase, the capacity to punish was introduced.
One condition, the ``peer-sanctioning condition,{''} was equivalent to
the prevailing solution in the experimental literature on collective
action, where the ability to punish others is distributed equally among
all group members. In the other two conditions, only a single group
``leader{''} could punish; we varied whether the person assigned to lead
was other-regarding (prosocial) or self-regarding (proself). The results
support our prediction that prosocial leaders increase their
contributions to the group after ascending to leadership, while proself
leaders reduce their contributions. Further, as expected, rank-and-file
group members are influenced by leaders' contribution behaviors; as a
result, prosocial-led groups as a whole were substantially more
productive than proself-led groups. Indeed, as predicted, prosocial
leaders were even more effective in maintaining large group
contributions than the standard peer-sanctioning system. These findings
suggest that putting power and influence in the right hands solves
collective action problems and promotes collective welfare.}"
"{This study makes a significant contribution to investigations of
household behavior by testing for a willingness to cooperate and share
income by men and women who are either in couple with each other or
complete strangers. We present results from an economic experiment
conducted with 100 co-habiting heterosexual couples. We compare
defection behavior in the prisoner's dilemma within real couples to
pairs of strangers. One out of four participants chose not to cooperate
with their spouse. To understand why spouses might prefer defection, we
use a novel allocation task to elicit the individual's trade-off between
efficiency and equality within a couple. We further investigate the
impact of socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the
couples. We find in particular that lack of preferences for joint income
maximization, having children and being married lead to higher defection
rates in the social dilemma.}"
"{Previous research aimed at testing the situational strength hypothesis
suffers from serious limitations regarding the conceptualization of
strength. In order to overcome these limitations, the present study
attempts to test the situational strength hypothesis based on the
operationalization of strength as reinforcement contingencies. One
dispositional factor of proven effect on cooperative behavior, social
value orientation (SVO), was used as a predictor of behavior in four
social dilemmas with varying degree of situational strength. The
moderating role of incentive condition (hypothetical vs. real) on the
relationship between SVO and behavior was also tested. One hundred
undergraduates were presented with the four social dilemmas and the
Social Value Orientation Scale. One-half of the sample played the social
dilemmas using real incentives, whereas the other half used hypothetical
incentives. Results supported the situational strength hypothesis in
that no behavioral variability and no effect of SVO on behavior were
found in the strongest situation. However, situational strength did not
moderate the effect of SVO on behavior in situations where behavior
showed variability. No moderating effect was found for incentive
condition either. The implications of these results for personality
theory and assessment are discussed.}"
"{Contributions to public goods benefit all group members, yet research
shows that generous group members are sometimes punished. We argue that
when such antisocial punishment efforts are public, the consistency of
group member contributions will encourage individuals to punish
atypically generous group members. Similarly, when behavior of group
members is consistent, the publicness of punishment will increase
antisocial punishment. Both of these effects will be weaker for
individuals who are interested in getting to know the generous deviant.
We test our hypotheses in a public goods experiment and find support.
Our findings contribute to the norms literature, in particular, to
understanding of antisocial punishment.}"
"{The experimental evidence suggests that groups are inefficient at
providing threshold public goods. This inefficiency appears to reflect
an inability to coordinate over how to distribute the cost of providing
the good. So, why do groups not just split the cost equally? We offer an
answer to this question by demonstrating that in a standard threshold
public good game there is no collectively rational recommendation. We
also demonstrate that if full agreement is required in order to provide
the public good then there is a collectively rational recommendation,
namely, to split the cost equally. Requiring full agreement may,
therefore, increase efficiency in providing threshold public goods. We
test this hypothesis experimentally and find support for it.}"
"{This article presents experimental evidence on the effects of
non-binding agreements on co-operation in public goods games. In
particular, it compares first-best agreements that require full
co-operation by all players and second-best agreements that require only
a minimum contribution level rather than full co-operation. The results
show that when there is no punishment opportunity, second-best
agreements work better than first-best agreements because they are more
likely to be formed and kept. First-best agreements form at the
beginning of the game, but non-compliant behaviour by some players
causes co-operation to collapse. This result is reversed when there is a
punishment opportunity. In this case, first-best agreements work better
than second-best agreements as they allow groups to establish a common
behavioural standard, deter violations, and achieve very high levels of
co-operation.}"
"{When public goods are co-produced by citizens and public authorities,
problems of free riding and problems of provider accountability
frequently coincide. How are voluntary contributions to a public good
sustained when they are vulnerable to rent extraction by a third party?
In a laboratory experiment, I test whether contributions in a public
goods dilemma can be decentrally enforced through costly, mutual
sanctioning capacity, even if the contributions can be misappropriated
by a third party. I find that costly sanctioning capacity among the
beneficiaries of a public good can substantially reduce free riding,
without increasing the rate at which contributions are misappropriated
by the provider. However, this effect can be undermined if mutual
sanctioning capacity exists between the third-party provider and the
beneficiaries. Contrary to existing predictions, social sanctioning
relationships which both embed the provider and encompass the
beneficiaries of a public good are not associated with greater, but
partly with lower public goods provision than sanctioning relationships
which are only embedding or encompassing.}"
"{Globalization challenges the ability of contemporary public
administration to encourage citizen participation in collective action
through behaviors such as tax compliance and contributions to public
goods. The authors introduce a new individual-level approach to
globalization, arguing that people vary in the extent to which they are
globalized and that an individual's level of globalism (ILG) reflects
attitudes and dispositions that influence the way he or she resolves the
social dilemma of participation in collective action (i.e., the decision
to contribute versus follow a free-ride strategy). Using a four-country
sample, the article examines the relationship between ILG and collective
action participation decisions in three behavioral experiments. Findings
support the hypothesis that regardless of country-level globalization, a
more globalized individual complies less willingly with tax codes,
donates less to local nongovernmental organizations, and prefers to
adopt a free-ride strategy in a public goods game. The consequences for
public administration are discussed.}"
"{The rational design approach to studying international agreements holds
that policy-makers evaluate costs and benefits of cooperation when
designing treaties and subsequently deciding on participation. To
influence this cost-benefit calculus, treaty designers sometimes include
a fund from which financial assistance is provided to treaty members and
to which treaty members contribute. We argue that the inclusion of a
funding mechanism in a treaty can increase but also decrease the costs
(benefits) of membership and can thus influence state choices on
participation in both directions. Specifically, we argue that: (1)
overall, states are more likely to join international agreements that
include a fund; (2) the probability of joining is higher for agreements
including a fund if contributions to the fund are voluntary; and (3)
countries are more likely to join agreements including a fund that
disburses assistance only to a select group of treaty members. We test
these arguments using a new dataset with information on 154 countries'
ratification behavior toward 178 multilateral environmental agreements
(MEAs) from 1950 to 2011. Our findings are in line with these arguments.
The main policy implication is that MEA designers interested in
maximizing treaty participation should include a formal funding
mechanism and, in an effort to balance out positive and negative effects
this might have on participation, base this mechanism on voluntary
contributions and selective entitlements.}"
"{This paper analyzes the impact of inequality in the distribution of
endowments on cooperation. We conduct a lab experiment using a dynamic
Public Good Game to test this relation. We introduce the possibility of
choosing among three different redistribution rules: Equidistribution,
Proportional to contribution and Progressive to endowment. This novelty
in a dynamic environment allows us to analyze how the inequality within
groups changes according to individual choices and to investigate if
players show inequity averse preferences. Results show that inequality
has a negative impact on individual contribution. Players act in order
to reduce the initial exogenous inequality. Indeed, in the Treatment
with the highest level of inequality, agents vote for reducing the
endowment heterogeneity. Moreover, individual contribution is strongly
influenced by others' contributions.}"
"{We examine the effects of endogenizing contribution productivity in a
repeated public good game. In our experimental treatment, subjects
collectively decide (by voting) how much to invest in augmenting the
technology for producing the public good, and subsequently make
individual voluntary contributions to provision. In the control,
contribution productivity is exogenous. Contributions in the two
treatments are similar.}"
"{A frequently cited argument against the use of market-based instruments
to provide public goods is that they diminish our sense of
responsibility to be good citizens. We report on a laboratory experiment
exploring whether the choice of some to contribute money in lieu effort
affects the voluntary contributions of those who continue to provide
effort. Subjects complete lab tasks as a contribution to a public good -
carbon emission reductions. These effort contributions decrease as peers
accept an offer to contribute money instead of effort. However, the
aggregate result masks significant heterogeneity. Those who choose not
to buy out despite its expected profitability have no response to the
treatment, while those for whom it would not be profitable to buy out
register large reductions in effort contributions. The magnitude of
these responses increases in the share of the group accepting the
buyout, suggesting that is the act of peers buying out - rather than the
introduction of monetary incentives - that drives the effect. (C) 2017

"{We experimentally investigate whether groups of heterogeneous agents can
reach an agreement on how to share the costs of providing a public good.
Thereby, we explore the performance of different burden sharing rules
being implemented either endogenously or exogenously. In case of an
endogenously implemented burden sharing rule, subjects vote for
different burden sharing schemes either by unanimity or majority vote.
Despite the fact that preferences for the allocation schemes differ
among agents, most groups agree upon a common scheme, and consequently
avoid an uncoordinated action. Our results reveal both the opportunities
and risks of burden sharing negotiations. We find average efficiency
levels to increase in case an agreement is reached. If groups however
fail to agree upon a common rule, cooperation collapses and efficiency
levels decrease compared to a voluntary contribution mechanism being
exogenously imposed. Most importantly, agents who face a voting decision
on average receive higher payoffs than agents in an exogenously
implemented voluntary contribution mechanism and do not earn less than
participants in any externally determined burden sharing rule.}"
"{In a novel experimental design, we study public good games with dynamic
interdependencies, where each agent's wealth at the end of period t
serves as her endowment in t+1. In this setting, growth and inequality
arise endogenously allowing us to address new questions regarding their
interplay and effect on cooperation. We find that amounts contributed
are increasing over time even in the absence of punishment
possibilities. Variation in wealth is substantial with the richest
groups earning more than ten times what the poorest groups earn.
Introducing the possibility of punishment does not increase wealth and
in some cases even decreases it. In the presence of a punishment option,
inequality in early periods is strongly negatively correlated with group
income in later periods, highlighting negative interaction effects
between endogenous inequality and punishment. (C) 2017 The Authors.

"{Potential Pareto Public Goods create an aggregate benefit to society
while harming some members of the community. As the overall benefit
outweighs the harm incurred, provision may lead to Pareto improvement if
the gains from cooperation are used to compensate the harmed parties.
Such situations are ubiquitous, e.g., in not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY)
problems. We study experimentally voluntary contributions to Potential
Pareto Public Goods, in which provision is efficient but harms a
minority in the group. We test the effects of punishment and reward
institutions, with and without communication. We find that contributions
to Potential Pareto Public Goods are not viewed as unequivocally
socially desirable and do hot increase with communication or punishment.
With the reward institution, communication facilitates compensation,
undoing the harm imposed on the minority player by majority
contributions. Consequently, contributions are no longer viewed as
socially undesirable, and majority contributions increase. Taken
together, our results establish that perceptions and behavior in
voluntary contributions to Potential Pareto Public Goods are
dramatically different than with universal public goods that benefit all
members of the community. We suggest that the underlying mechanism is
team reasoning: individuals consider what is good for the group, and
play their part in achieving that goal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

"{We study using laboratory experiments the impact on cooperation of
allowing individuals to invest in group-specific, excludable public
goods. We find that allowing different social groups to voluntarily
contribute to such goods increases total contributions. However, a
significant proportion of that contribution goes toward the
group-specific club good rather than the public good, even when the
latter has higher financial returns to cooperation. We find significant
evidence of in-group biases, which are manifested by positive in-group
reciprocity. That is, club goods allow subjects to display their
preferences for interaction with their in-group members, as well as
positive in-group reciprocity.}"
"{By combining two different types of experiments in one experimental
session, this paper aims at understanding how different contexts may
influence participants' choices. This paper focuses on one hybrid
experimental session that mixed one voluntary contributions mechanism
(VCM), influencing the indemnity received by participants, and one
mechanism eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for milk bottles with
public and private attributes. The VCM shows relatively high levels of
contributions that are mainly influenced by the positive expectations of
participants about the average group contribution, rather than by the
variations in the design of this mechanism and the period of
experiments. The WTP for milk bottles are particularly sensitive to the
order of mechanisms and to the period of experiments. Conversely, the
WTP differences between milk bottles for a given round of information
are invariant across the order of mechanisms and the period of
experiments. For each bottle, the variations of WTP coming from the
messages about private and public attributes are also stable over the
order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. This confers validity
to experiments for measuring WTP for public and private attributes
related to food. In other words, these variations of WTP contribute to
welfare estimates and are useful to evaluate market regulations focusing
on public and/or private attributes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

"{Canal siltation is a pervasive problem in coastal Bangladesh causing
water-logging and losses in crop yield. Although timely maintenance of
canals through regular contributions from the community can solve this
problem, it often breaks down because of the free riding issue, a common
feature in the provision of public goods. Previous literature on
experimental games has shown how different communication strategies or
leadership can help to achieve coordination. We conducted experimental
games with the aims to: (i) determine the effectiveness of these
different strategies in the specific problem of maintenance of canal;
and (ii) compare the relative effectiveness of different communication
mechanisms or leadership. Playing these games was also a part of a
participatory action research approach with the idea that community
members would have a clearer understanding of the incentives and
constraints of contribution for canal maintenance. The basic insight
from our study is that any institution that enables more information
sharing about both the intended contribution and setting the group norm
translates into better coordination among the users to increase the
group income towards Pareto Optimum outcomes. The lessons from these
games could potentially open up a forum of discussion and help the
villagers in their future communications as a tool for understanding and
testing different alternatives for community management of natural
resources. The results are also of interest for development
practitioners supporting community organisations for sustaining local
public goods.}"
"{Economic research suggests that, in some circumstances, exogenously
restricting the information leaders can provide to followers can
overcome the free-riding problem and coordination failures, and improve
efficiency in collective actions. The reason is that a leader's
information advantage can deprive followers of the information necessary
for profitable defection. In this paper, we focus on situations where
the decision to restrict access to information is an endogenous choice
made by the leader. We experimentally investigate if leaders choose to
strategically withhold information when appropriate to improve outcomes.
To address this question, we adopt a single-shot collective action game
in which a leader-follower setting with information advantage for the
leader can potentially solve the free-riding problem and coordination
failures. Our results suggest that leaders, in many circumstances, fail
to utilize their information advantage to improve efficiency. This
implies that groups may benefit if a nontransparent information regime
is exogenously imposed on them.}"
"{We conduct a laboratory experiment to study how, after a history of
decay, cooperation in a repeated voluntary contribution game can be
revived in an enduring way. Simply starting the repeated game over-a
simple fresh start-leads to an initial increase of cooperation, but to a
subsequent new decay. Motivated by cooperation decay in organizations we
study the potential of three interventions of triggering higher and
sustained cooperation, which take place at the same time as a restart.
Surprisingly, we find that the detailed explanation of the causes of the
decay in cooperation of Fischbacher and Gachter (Am Econ Rev
100:541-556, 2010) combined with an advice on how to prevent decay do
not have an effect beyond that of just starting over. In contrast, a
one-way free form communication message sent by the leader to the
followers strongly revives cooperation. We find evidence that repeated
free form communication by the leader further strengthens the reviving
effect on cooperation. Combining the two previous interventions does not
outperform the pure effect of communication. Our content analysis
reveals that leader communication is more people oriented than the
expert advice.}"
"{In mixed-motive interactions, defection is the rational and common
response to the defection of others. In some cases, however, group
members not only cooperate in the face of defection but also compensate
for the shortfalls caused by others' defection. In one field and two lab
studies, we examined when group members were willing to compensate for
versus match defection using sequential dilemmas. We found that the
level of identification with the broader group increased willingness to
compensate for intragroup defection, even when it was personally costly.
Compensating for a defecting partner's actions, however, is not an act
of unconditional cooperation: It is accompanied by a lack of trust in
the errant group member and a desire to be perceived as more ethical.
Cooperation by others, on the other hand, is matched independent of
whether the cooperator was an in-group or out-group member. We find
similar patterns of compensation and matching when the personal cost
involved contributing money or effort. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

"{I study a multilateral bargaining game in which committee members invest
in a common project prior to redistributing the total value of
production. The game corresponds to a Baron and Ferejohn (1989)
legislative bargaining model preceded by a production stage that is
similar to a voluntary contribution mechanism. In this game,
contributions reach almost full efficiency in a random rematching
experimental design. Bargaining outcomes tend to follow an equity
standard of proportionality: higher contributors obtain higher shares.
Unlike other bargaining experiments with an exogenous fund, allocations
involving payments to all members are modal instead of minimum winning
coalitions, and proposer power is quite low.}"
"{We report the results of an experiment that investigates - free riding
in the accumulation of durable public goods. We consider economies with
reversibility, where contributions can be positive or negative; and
economies with irreversibility, where contributions are - nonnegative.
Aggregate outcomes support the qualitative predictions of the Markov
Perfect Equilibria (MPE) characterized in Battaglini, Nunnari, and
Palfrey (2014): steady state levels of public good are lower with
reversibility than irreversibility; accumulation is inefficiently slow;
and the public good is - under-provided in both regimes. On the other
hand, public good levels are higher than MPE, and some evidence of
history dependence is detected.}"
"{International and domestic efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
require a coordinated effort from heterogeneous actors. In this context,
using a public good game with a climate change framing, the experiment
reported here examines whether groups of heterogeneous individuals can
meet a collective emission-reduction target through individual
contributions. In terms of the framing, participants differ in terms of
their marginal costs of abatement. The experiment consists of two games:
a counterfactual baseline scenario examining the scope for voluntary
cooperation and a communication game examining the role of stakeholder
participation in facilitating cooperation. During the communication
game, subjects are able to communicate with one another in order to
coordinate contribution strategies. The results suggest that relying on
the voluntary cooperation of individuals will not be sufficient to meet
the mitigation target. Furthermore, while communication plays a role in
promoting cooperation, even when heterogeneity is present, the
non-binding nature of communication results in significant levels of
free-riding. In particular, with the introduction of communication, two
dominant contribution norms of free-riding and perfect-cooperation
emerge. This outcome emphasizes the importance of sanctioning
opportunities in ensuring compliance with mitigation obligations.}"
"{We study behavior in repeated interactions when agents have no
information about the structure of the underlying game and they cannot
observe other agents' actions or payoffs. Theory shows that even when
players have no such information, there are simple payoff based learning
rules that lead to Nash equilibrium in many types of games. A key
feature of these rules is that subjects search differently depending on
whether their payoffs increase, stay constant or decrease. This paper
analyzes learning behavior in a laboratory setting and finds strong
confirmation for these asymmetric search behaviors in the context of
voluntary contribution games. By varying the amount of information we
show that these behaviors are also present even when subjects have full
information about the game. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

"{We explore the effect of fixed versus dynamic group membership on public
good provision. In a novel experimental design, we modify the
traditional voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM) by periodically
replacing old members of a group with new members over time. Under this
dynamic, overlapping generations matching protocol we find that average
contributions experience significantly less decay over time relative to
a traditional VCM environment with fixed group membership and a common
termination date. These findings suggest that the traditional pattern of
contribution and decay seen in many public goods experiments may not
accurately reflect behavior in groups with changing membership, as is
the case in many real-world environments.}"
"{This experimental study examines behavior in a linear public goods game
with an appropriation frame where we vary the value of individual
benefits and the group losses from appropriation. Parallel to the
literature on public goods provision, individual appropriation decreases
with the marginal damage to the group that occurs through appropriation
and increases in the private benefit from appropriation. In addition, we
examine a novel set of decision situations where individual benefits and
group damages change proportionately, as to hold the marginal per capita
return constant. Individual responses to these proportionate changes are
heterogeneous but on average, appropriation levels do not change
significantly. These results are robust to two experimental designs, a
one-shot menu design where subjects make multiple choices and a
complementary set of sessions where participants make a single decision
in a one-shot game. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{In this paper we provide a direct test of the inequality aversion
hypothesis based on aggregate outcomes using the Patron Game, a version
of a Public Good Game that mandates that only one member of a group
contributes to the public good. We find evidence that inequality
aversion does not play any role, as the average contribution does not
increase when the distribution of endowments is manipulated to generate
a situation of favorable inequality for the patron, compared to the case
in which there is no inequality ex ante.}"
"{Emotions are commonly experienced and expressed in human societies;
however, their consequences on economic behaviour have received only
limited attention. This paper investigates the effects of induced
positive and negative emotions on cooperation and sanctioning behaviour
in a one-shot voluntary contributions mechanism game, where personal and
social interests are at odds. We concentrate on two specific emotions:
anger and happiness. Our findings provide clear evidence that measures
of social preferences are sensitive to subjects' current emotional
states. Specifically, angry subjects contribute, on average, less than
happy subjects and overall welfare as measured by average net earnings
is lower when subjects are in an angry mood. We also find that how
punishment is used is affected by moods: angry subjects punish harsher
than happy subjects, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that anger,
when induced, can have a negative impact on economic behaviour. (C) 2015

"{The expectation that non-cooperators will be punished can help to
sustain cooperation, but there are competing claims about whether
opportunities to engage in higher-order punishment (punishing punishment
or failure to punish) help or undermine cooperation in social dilemmas.
Varying treatments of a voluntary contribution experiment, we find that
availability of higher-order punishment opportunities increases
cooperation and efficiency when subjects have full information on the
pattern of punishing and its history, when any subject can punish any
other, and when the numbers of punishment and of contribution stages are
not too unequal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{We investigate the effect of priming on pro-social behaviour in a
setting where there is a clear financial incentive to free ride. By
activating the concept of cooperation among randomly selected
individuals, we explore whether it is possible to positively influence
people's voluntary contributions to the public good. Our findings
indicate that cooperative priming increases contributions in a one-shot
public goods game from approximately 25-36 \% compared with the
non-primed group. The results call for further explorations of the role
of priming in economic behaviours in general.}"
"{We study the link between individual attitudes toward uncertainty on the
one hand, and preferences over, as well as behavior within, various
public goods institutions on the other hand. We incentive-compatibly
elicit preferences over voluntary contribution mechanisms with and
without reward and punishment options and then randomly assign subjects
to play in one of the four institutions. We find that payoffs are
significantly greater when punishment is allowed but that only a small
minority of participants prefers such an environment. Somewhat
surprisingly, preferences over institutions are generally independent of
individual characteristics. Conversely, individual characteristics,
including institutional preferences, are significantly predictive of
behavior in the public goods game. For instance, risk-averse individuals
preemptively punish more often. This suggests that when studying
sanctions and rewards, it is important to consider individual attitudes
toward risk and uncertaintyalthough they may not affect the original
selection into institutions.}"
"{We propose an intergroup competition scheme (ICS) to theoretically solve
free riding in team production and provide experimental evidence from a
voluntary contribution mechanism public goods game. The ICS includes an
internal transfer payment from the lowest to highest contributing team
proportional to the difference in group contributions. The ICS requires
minimal information, makes the efficient contribution a dominant
strategy, and is budget balanced. These features make the ICS ideally
suited to solve the moral hazard problem in team production. Our
experiment demonstrates that the ICS raises contributions to almost
reach optimality with the appropriate parameters. We also show
experimentally that the success of the ICS can be primarily attributed
to the effect of higher returns and to the introduction of competition,
and it is not due to the introduction of potential losses or information
regarding other groups.}"
"{Our experiment studies the impact of two types of relational goods on
the voluntary contributions for the production of a public good, i.e.
acquaintance among the contributors and performance of a team work
before the experiment. Our results show that: (1) both team work and
previous acquaintance increase the average contribution to the public
good, and (2) there is a relevant gender effect with women contributing
more or less than men, depending on the treatment. Therefore, we
conclude that both relational goods are important to enhance
co-operation, that acquaintance and working together are rather
complements than substitutes, and that different relational goods
produce different effects on cooperation. Also, we find further evidence
for women's behaviour to be more context-specific than men's.}"
"{Many natural systems involve thresholds that, once triggered, imply
irreversible damages for the users. Although the existence of such
thresholds is undisputed, their location is highly uncertain. We explore
experimentally how threshold uncertainty affects collective action in a
series of threshold public goods games. Whereas the public good is
always provided when the exact value of the threshold is known,
threshold uncertainty is generally detrimental for the public good
provision as contributions become more erratic. The negative effect of
threshold uncertainty is particularly severe when it takes the form of
ambiguity, i.e. when players are not only unaware of the value of the
threshold, but also of its probability distribution. Early and credible
commitment helps groups to cope with uncertainty.}"

"{Common identity and peer punishment have been identified as crucial
means to reduce free riding and promote cooperation in teams. This paper
examines the relative importance of these two mechanisms under two
income distributions in team cooperation. In a repeated public good
experiment, we use different combinations of homogeneous/heterogeneous
endowments, strong/weak identity, and absence/presence of peer
punishment. We find that without punishment, a strong identity can raise
cooperation in homogenous and heterogeneous teams, but that the effect
depends on the strength of the identity. When punishment is introduced,
the impact of punishment depends on the strength of the
identity-building activity and the effectiveness of punishment.
Furthermore, we find no evidence of stronger cooperation or punishment
in teams with strong identity. These findings provide important
implications for management policy makers in organizations: ex ante
income heterogeneity should be implemented in teams with caution, and
the decision of whether identity or punishment is a more effective norm
enforcement mechanism in teams is rather sensitive to their interaction
and relative strengths. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Do individuals trained in law enforcement punish or reward differently
from typical student-subjects? We analyze norm enforcement behavior of
newly appointed police commissioners in both a game with positive
externalities (based on a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism) and a
similar game with negative externalities. Depending on the treatment, a
reward or sanction institution is either exogenously or endogenously
implemented. Police commissioners cooperate significantly more in both
games and bear a higher burden of the sanction costs compared to
non-police subjects. When the norm enforcement institution is
endogenous, subjects favor rewards over sanctions, but police subjects
are more likely to vote for sanctions. Police subjects also reward and
sanction more than the others when the institution results from a
majority vote. Our experiment suggests that lab evidence on social
dilemma games with positive or negative externalities and enforcement
institutions is rather robust. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

quality. Our experiment consists of a dictator game designed to address

"{Abundant evidence suggests that high levels of contributions to public
goods can be sustained through self-governed monitoring and sanctioning.
This experimental study investigates the effectiveness of decentralized
sanctioning institutions in alternative punishment networks. Our results
show that the structure of punishment network significantly affects
allocations to the public good. In addition, we observe that network
configurations are more important than punishment capacities for the
levels of public good provision, imposed sanctions and economic
efficiency. Lastly, we show that targeted revenge is a major driver of
anti-social punishment.}"
"{We investigate the endogenous formation of sanctioning institutions
supposed to improve efficiency in the voluntary provision of public
goods. Our paper parallels Markussen et al. (Rev Econ Stud 81:301-324,
2014) in that our experimental subjects vote over formal versus informal
sanctions, but it goes beyond that paper by endogenizing the formal
sanction scheme. We find that self-determined formal sanctions schemes
are popular and efficient when they carry no up-front cost, but as in
Markussen et al. informal sanctions are more popular and efficient than
formal sanctions when adopting the latter entails such a cost. Practice
improves the performance of sanction schemes: they become more targeted
and deterrent with learning. Voters' characteristics, including their
tendency to engage in perverse informal sanctioning, help to predict
individual voting.}"
"{Many social dilemmas exhibit nonlinearities and equilibrium outcomes in
the interior of the choice space. This paper reports a laboratory
experiment studying whether peer punishment promotes socially efficient
behavior in such environments, which have been ignored in most
experimental studies of peer punishment. It compares the effectiveness
of peer punishment in a linear public good game to the effectiveness of
this decentralized enforcement mechanism in two nonlinear social dilemma
games: a piecewise linear public good game and a common pool resource
game. While peer punishment improves cooperation in these new
environments, the impact of punishment is weaker and takes longer to be
effective. This appears to be due to the greater complexity of the
nonlinear settings, which makes socially optimal choices more difficult
to identify.}"
"{Punishment has been shown to be an effective reinforcement mechanism.
Intentional or not, punishment will likely generate spillover effects
that extend beyond one's immediate decision environment, and these
spillovers are not as well understood. We seek to understand these
secondary spillover effects in a controlled lab setting using a standard
social dilemma: the voluntary contributions mechanism. We find that
spillovers occur when others observe punishment outside their own social
dilemma. However, the direction of the spillover effect depends
crucially on personal punishment history and whether one is personally
exempt from punishment or not.}"

considerable evidence in real-world settings that challenges this
finding. To reconcile this difference, we propose a two-stage model that
links appropriation of the CPR and provision of public goods in an
attempt to explain the emergence of cooperation in the management of
CPRs under environmental uncertainty. Benchmark predictions are derived
from the model, and subsequently tested experimentally under different
marginal cost-benefit structures concerning the voluntary contribution
to the provision of the good. Our results suggest that the severity of
the appropriation problem may significantly be mitigated by the presence
of an option for voluntarily contributing a fraction of the income
surplus from the appropriation phase to the provision of the public
good. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}"
"{We conduct a controlled field experiment in 52 communities in rural
Bolivia to investigate the effect that local authorities have on
voluntary public good provision. In our study, community members pool
resources to provide environmental education material for local schools.
We find that voluntary contributions increase when democratically
elected local authorities lead by example. The results are driven by two
factors: (1) authorities, like other individuals, give more when they
are called upon to lead than when they give in private, and (2) high
leader contributions increase the likelihood that others follow. Both
effects are stronger when authorities, as compared to randomly selected
community members, lead by example. We explore two underlying sources of
leadership influence. First, we provide evidence that the effect of a
leader's contribution is not limited to signaling the value of the
public good. Second, we examine how leader characteristics affect the
likelihood that others follow. Specifically, our study shows that
authority influence is driven by a combination of formal leadership
status, observable characteristics, and the amount that authorities
contribute when they give publicly before others. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"{According to popular belief, frogs are boiled to death when the water is
heated gradually. In this paper, we investigate how humans respond to a
very slow versus a very steep increase of a subsidy on contributions to
a public good. In an experiment, we vary the mode of the increase
(gradual versus quick). When the subsidy is raised to an intermediate
level, we see a modest effect in either treatment. When the subsidy is
raised to a substantial level, there is a strong effect of a quick
increase and a modest effect of a gradual increase in the subsidy. (C)

"{In a laboratory experiment, the voluntary provision of public goods is
investigated when there is probabilistic uncertainty about the monetary
return from production of the public good. After group members make
their provision decisions, the return is drawn from an exogenously
determined probability distribution. In a linear decision setting,
voluntary provision of the public good is contrasted across three
treatments. In the ``uncertainA{''} treatment, the return is randomly
drawn from a discrete probability distribution. In the ``uncertainB{''}
treatment, the return is drawn from a discrete probability distribution
that is a mean-preserving spread of the distribution in the uncertainA
treatment, but has larger variance. In the ``certain{''} treatment, the
return is known with certainty and equal to the expected value of the
return in the uncertainA and uncertainB treatments. The data reveal that
average provision of the public good is lower in treatments with
uncertainty. However, the negative impact of uncertainty on provision
only occurs when subjects experience the certain treatment prior to
experiencing an uncertain treatment, suggesting an order effect to
uncertainty. Also, there is evidence that subjects in treatments with
higher uncertainty (variance of the public-good return) display a
version of the ``gambler''s fallacy.{''}}"
"{I show how improper conditioning of beliefs can reduce contribution in
public goods environments with interdependent values. I consider a
simple model of a binary, excludable public good. In equilibrium,
provision of the public good is good news about its value. Naive players
who condition expectations only on their private information contribute
too little, despite the absence of free-riding incentives. In a
laboratory experiment, contributions indeed fall short of the
equilibrium prediction. Using modified games with different
belief-conditioning effects, I verify that subjects fail to condition
beliefs properly. However, improper belief conditioning cannot fully
explain the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{We report the results of experiments designed to investigate the effects
of random public revelation of individual choices on voluntary
contributions to a public good. Varying the number of subjects whose
contributions are made public, we find that public revelation always

"{We experimentally investigate the effects of two different sources of
heterogeneity - capability and valuation - on the provision of public
goods when punishment is possible or not. We find that compared to
homogeneous groups, asymmetric valuations for the public good have
negative effects on cooperation and its enforcement through informal
sanctions. Asymmetric capabilities in providing the public good, in
contrast, have a positive and stabilizing effect on voluntary
contributions. The main reason for these results is the different
externalities contributions have on the other group members' payoffs
affecting individuals' willingness to cooperate. We thus provide
evidence that it is not the asymmetric nature of groups per se that
facilitates or impedes collective action, but that it is rather the
nature of asymmetry that determines the degree of cooperation and the
level of public good provision. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"{We investigate the nature of continuous time strategic interaction in
public-goods games. In one set of treatments, four subjects make
contribution decisions in continuous time during a 10-min interval while
in another they make them only at 10 discrete points of time during this
interval. The effect of continuous time is muted in public-goods games
compared to simpler social dilemmas and the data suggest that widespread
coordination problems are to blame. When we add a rich communication
protocol, these coordination problems largely disappear and the median
subject contributes completely to the public good with no sign of decay
over time. At the median, the same communication protocol is less than
half as effective in discrete time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"{Multiple group memberships are the rule rather than the exception.
Within a linear public good game, we experimentally investigate two
possible factors that impact the decision to cooperate in a smaller,
local or a larger, global group: diverging marginal per capita returns,
resulting in different social returns, and social feedback information.
If social returns are equal across groups, subjects prefer to contribute
to the local group that offers social information on individual
contributions. An increase of the social return in the global group
initially attracts more contributions, but this tendency quickly
unravels in favor of cooperation in the local group. Cooperation in the
global public good can only be sustained if contributions of global
group members can be observed. We thus identify social feedback
information as a key factor for institutional design to foster
cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{We conduct a randomized field experiment with a Yale service club and
find that the promise of public recognition increases giving. Some may
claim that they give when offered public recognition in order to
motivate others to give too, rather than for the more obvious expected
private gain from increasing one's social standing. To tease apart these
two theories, we also conduct a laboratory experiment with

a desire to improve social image than a purely altruistic desire to
motivate others' contributions. We discuss the external validity of our

"{We measure people's pro-social behavior, in terms of voluntary money and
labor contributions to an archetypical public good, a bridge, and in
terms of voluntary money contributions in a public good game, using the

contributions (one in terms of money and one in terms of labor), one is
from a natural field experiment, and one is from an artefactual field

positive and statistically significant correlation between voluntary

"{Budget constraints at the local government level towards the provision
of public goods have fuelled interest in the voluntary contribution and
provision point mechanisms. However, due to their public nature, these
mechanisms are not without problems. The literature shows the presence
of free riding and socially inefficient contribution levels. This paper
experimentally tests the effect of cultural and historical information
pertaining to heritage houses in Penang, Malaysia, on public
contributions for their conservation. This paper considers a standard
linear one-shot four-person public good game and the decision of the
subjects being to contribute either to a private or to a public account.
We devise 4 treatments: a Control treatment, a treatment where subjects
are provided with cultural and historical information pertaining to the
heritage houses, a treatment that includes a contribution threshold, and
finally a treatment that combines the use of cultural and historical
information with the contribution threshold. The main finding shows that
60-75 \% of the subjects contributed more than what they believed others
in the same group would contribute when they were provided with the
pertinent cultural and historical information. Most of the subjects
contributed less than their belief, while 75-77 \% cooperated
`selfishly' in treatments without the information. These findings are in
agreement with the literature, namely that contributions are higher in
treatments with a contribution threshold. Moreover, the combination of a
contribution threshold and cultural information could encourage more
pro-social behaviours.}"
"{We analyze how corruption affects incentives to invest or contribute to

measurements ({''}missing inputs{''}) to explain variation in investment
behavior of villagers. Investment behavior is gauged with two simple
artefactual field experiments. Our main results are that corruption (i)
undermines incentives for voluntary contributions to local public goods
and (ii) may reduce private investments of individuals subject to
rent-seeking by the chief in real life. We also provide weaker evidence
that the impact of corruption on investments and contributions to public
goods is heterogeneous: this impact may be gender-specific and appears
to vary with accessibility of communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

"{In many cases individuals benefit differently from the provision of a
public good. We study in a laboratory experiment how heterogeneity in
returns and uncertainty about the own return affects unconditional and
conditional contribution behavior in a linear public goods game. The
elicitation of conditional contributions in combination with a within
subject design allows us to investigate belief-independent and
type-specific reactions to heterogeneity. We find that, on average,
heterogeneity in returns decreases unconditional contributions but
affects contributions only weakly. Uncertainty in addition to
heterogeneity reduces conditional contributions slightly. Individual
reactions to heterogeneity differ systematically. Selfish subjects and
one third of conditional cooperators do not react to heterogeneity
whereas the reactions of the remaining conditional cooperators vary. A
substantial part of heterogeneity in reactions can be explained by
inequity aversion with respect to different reference groups.}"
"{In a door-to-door fundraising field experiment, we study the impact of
fundraising mechanisms on charitable giving. We approached about 4500
households, each participating in an all-pay auction, a lottery, a
non-anonymous voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM), or an anonymous
VCM. In contrast to the VCMs, households in the all-pay auction and the
lottery competed for a prize. Although the all-pay auction is the
superior fundraising mechanism both in theory and in the laboratory, it
did not raise the highest revenue per household in the field and even
raised significantly less than the anonymous VCM. Our experiment reveals
that this can be attributed to substantially lower participation in the
all-pay auction than in the other mechanisms while the average donation
for those who contribute is only slightly (and statistically
insignificantly) higher. We explore various explanations for this lower
participation and favor one that argues that competition in the all-pay
mechanism crowds out intrinsic motivations to contribute. (C) 2013

"{We experimentally study aid distribution and cooperation in a field lab
in rural Nicaragua. In the first stage of the experimental game,
participants contribute to a collective effort that determines the
amount of aid given to the group, which is distributed among the players
in a second stage. We find that in a treatment where a group
representative, selected as the highest contributor, distributes aid,
contributions are higher compared to a treatment where aid is equally
distributed. The higher amounts of aid attracted, however, benefit
representatives only. At the same time, representatives do care about
fairness. They give higher aid shares to players with low endowments and
lower shares to low contributors. Moreover, representatives with lower
relative wealth or who contribute relatively more, keep higher aid
shares. With our experimental game simulating community-based
development (CBD) schemes, we discuss the implications of our results
for elite capture in such schemes.}"
"{A common feature of many intra-household models is the assumption of
efficiency. This paper uses an experimental design to directly test
this. Data from 1,200 married couples in Ethiopia were collected using
treatments that vary initial endowments of spouses, final allocation
rules and information in a voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM).
Efficiency is decisively rejected in all treatments. Information
improves efficiency only in some treatments, suggesting that the role of
information is context dependent. Husbands expectations of their wives
contributions are higher than their wives actual contributions, and
wives expectations of their husbands contributions are lower than their
husbands actual contributions. These systematic errors in expected and
actual behaviour imply that the attainment of equilibrium as in a game
theoretic framework is unlikely. Statistical tests indicate that instead
of efficiency, other considerations are likely important. Overall, most
of the empirical results cast doubt on models of the household that
assume Pareto efficiency.}"
"{We study the interplay between leading-by-example and group identity in
a three-person sequential voluntary contributions game experiment. A
common identity between the leader and her two followers is beneficial

treatments we study the effects of heterogeneous identities. We find no
effect on cooperation when only one of the followers shares the leader's
identity, or when followers share a common identity that differs from
that of the leader. We conclude that group identity is an effective but
fragile instrument to promote cooperation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

"{Perverse punishment may hinder cooperation. Perverse punishment includes
retaliation punishment and non-retaliation punishment, hereafter other
perverse punishment. We design two treatments of contributing to a
public good: anonymous punishment (AP) and public punisher ID to the
punishee (PPID) treatments. Retaliation is possible in PPID, but not in
AP. PPID does generate more retaliation punishments. We also find that
contributions in PPID are relatively stable across different group
sizes, while voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM) and AP are more
sensitive to changes in group size. We explain the effectiveness of the
punishment scheme by the legitimacy of a punishment. In PPID, the
possibility of retaliation makes a subject deliberate more on the
legitimacy of a punishment when he/she is contemplating imposing one,
which leads to less perverse punishment and a higher level of
cooperation in our experiment. This effect is more prominent in larger
groups when targeting the punisher becomes harder without knowing the
punisher's ID in AP. In particular, while the effect of whether a
subject is punished on the increment of contribution is not
statistically significant, the number of punishers does increase the
amount of contribution significantly.}"
"{There is evidence in the literature that non-verbal physical features
are used as cues for a propensity to cooperate. However, further studies
of the human ability to visually detect cooperativeness are required. In
particular, the existence of static facial cues of altruism remains
questionable. Moreover, an investigation of both sex differences and
cross-cultural applicability with respect to altruism detection skills
is crucial in the context of the evolution of human cooperation. In this
study, we used both a public good game and a charitable contribution to
assess the cooperativeness of 156 men and 172 women in rural Senegal and
took facial photographs of these individuals. The second portion of the
study was conducted in France. In total, 194 men and 171 women were
asked to distinguish the most and least selfish individual from a series
of 80 pairs of Senegalese facial photographs, each pair consisting of
the highest and the lowest contributor from a group in the public good
game. Using mixed modeling techniques, we controlled for facial
masculinity, age and socioeconomic status. For male pairs, both male and
female French raters were able to identify more often than by chance
which individual made the smallest contribution to the public good in
each group; however, detection was not successful with female faces.
These results suggest that sex-specific traits are involved and that
only male facial traits indicating cooperative skills are, at least
inter-culturally, readable. The specific facial traits involved are
investigated. However, the charitable contribution was not correlated
with the contribution to the public good, and further work is necessary
to identify which specific altruistic traits are detectable and to
assess the generality of these results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

"{Sacrifice is widely believed to enhance cooperation in churches,
communes, gangs, clans, military units, and many other groups. We find
that sacrifice can also work in the lab, apart from special ideologies,
identities, or interactions. Our subjects play a modified VCM game-one
in which they can voluntarily join groups that provide reduced rates of
return on private investment. This leads to both endogenous sorting
(because free-riders tend to reject the reduced-rate option) and
substitution (because reduced private productivity favours increased
club involvement). Seemingly unproductive costs thus serve to screen out
free-riders, attract conditional cooperators, boost club production, and
increase member welfare. The sacrifice mechanism is simple and
particularly useful where monitoring difficulties impede punishment,
exclusion, fees, and other more standard solutions.}"
"{We conduct public goods experiments in which participant groups are
heterogeneous in regards to the source of their endowments. We find that
this dimension of heterogeneity significantly reduces contributions to

individual level, subjects tend to underadjust with respect to the Nash
prediction. We also observe an insignificant adjustment asymmetry
between the poor and the rich: Subjects who become poorer adjust their

"{A number of studies of the positively-framed voluntary contribution
mechanism (VCM) public goods game have examined the role of context on
participant behavior. Relatively little attention, however, has been
given to the effects of context in negatively-framed VCM games even

challenges, such as common pool resource use and pollution
externalities. This study uses a carefully-controlled laboratory
experiment to investigate the degree to which the context in which
decisions are made influences decision making in a negatively-framed VCM
laboratory experiment. The context treatments that we evaluate vary
communication, voting, and the status quo of the initial endowment.
Results indicate that providing groups the opportunity to communicate
and vote significantly reduces choices that impose external costs.
Importantly, the pro-social effects of communication and voting are
strongest when the status quo endowment is the private account, which
generates costs on other participants. This result suggests that the
effect of the status quo endowment is a function of whether the social
dilemma is framed positively or negatively when communication between
participants is allowed.}"
"{This paper examines the voluntary formation of centralized sanctioning

lead to the voluntary formation of centralized sanctioning institutions
in equilibrium. Our experimental results show that in practise human
readiness to cooperate among unrelated individuals may give rise to
socially wasteful sanctioning mechanisms. Our results indicate that
inefficient institutions emerge due to heterogeneous perceptions
pertaining to the sufficiently high level of forfeiture. Our results
suggest that opportunities to choose between different sanctioning
schemes and waive rights to sue may improve the match between

money to shift the threshold requirement of the donations for project
success downwards, the proportion of donors and the total amount of
donations strictly and continuously increase with the amount of seed
money. This result is partially compatible with the field experimental
evidence in List and Lucking-Reiley (2002).}"
"{We study a fundamental conflict in economic decision-making, the

vote on or exogenously encounter incentive settings while assigned
unequal endowments are either task-determined or random. We find that
earned endowments lead to less support for redistribution and less

"{This study reports data from a laboratory experiment that investigates
the incentive effect of three distinct social communication schemes on

treatments vary in terms of subjects' opportunities to anonymously
assign (1) only the approval ratings to other group members, (2) only
the disapproval ratings to other group members, and (3) either the
approval or the disapproval ratings to other group members (but not both
to the same group member), after they play a standard linear public good
game. Despite the Nash prediction of zero individual contribution in all
three treatments, the data show that the disapproval points generate
significantly higher contribution than the approval points. The
treatment in which subjects could communicate either the approval or the
disapproval points produces the highest level of contribution. We
discuss the implications that these findings may have for efficient
design of organizations. (JEL D03, H41, C72, C92)}"
"{Experimental studies of social dilemmas have shown that while the
existence of a sanctioning institution improves cooperation within
groups, it also has a detrimental impact on group earnings in the short
run. Could the introduction of pre-play threats to punish have enough of
a beneficial impact on cooperation, while not incurring the cost
associated with actual punishment, so that they increase overall
welfare? We report an experiment in which players can issue non-binding
threats to punish others based on their contribution levels to a public
good. After observing others' actual contributions, they choose their
actual punishment level. We find that threats increase the level of
contributions significantly. Efficiency is improved, but only in the
latter periods. However, the possibility of sanctioning differences
between threatened and actual punishment leads to lower threats,
cooperation, and welfare, restoring them to levels equal to or below the
levels attained in the absence of threats. (JEL C92, H41, D63)}"
"{We investigate the emergence and enforcement of contribution norms to
public goods in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups. With survey data
we demonstrate that uninvolved individuals hold well defined yet
conflicting normative views of fair contribution rules related to
efficiency, equality, and equity. In the experiment, in the absence of
punishment no positive contribution norm is observed and all groups
converge towards free-riding. With punishment, strong and stable
differences in contributions emerge across group types and individuals
in different roles. In some cases these differences result from the
emergence of an efficiency norm where all fully contribute. In the cases
where full efficiency is not attained, these differences result from the
enforcement of different relative contribution norms. Hence, our
experimental data show that, even in heterogeneous groups, individuals
can overcome the collective action problem inherent in public good games
by agreeing on and enforcing a contribution norm. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"{This paper uses laboratory experiments to evaluate the performance of a
deposit-refund mechanism used to enforce compliance with voluntary
public-good commitments made in the absence of strong regulatory
institutions. With this mechanism agents decide whether to join an
agreement and pay a deposit prior to making their contribution
decisions. If an agreement receives sufficient membership to form,
members then make their contribution decisions and compliant members are
refunded their deposits. If an agreement does not form, then deposits
are immediately refunded and a standard voluntary contribution game is
played. We find that the deposit-refund mechanism achieves nearly full
efficiency when agreements require full participation, but is far less
effective, and in some cases disruptive, when agreements require only
partial participation. As the mechanism does not require the existence
of strong sanctioning institutions, it is particularly suited for
enforcing compliance with international environmental agreements.}"
"{This paper reports experimental results that link other-regarding

However, the response to a tax-financed contribution is uniform. All
player types reduce their contribution by an amount equal to the tax, a

"{We report the results of a laboratory experiment on crowd-out in a
voluntary contribution mechanism public good game. In our setting, a
standard argument states that a tax should not be effective in raising
contributions, because agents respond by reducing voluntary
contributions by the amount of the tax. Our experimental design focuses
in on this intuition by abstracting away from several potential
confounds. We use a specification for the payoff function in which there
is a dominant strategy for own-earnings maximizing agents, located
interior to and in the upper half of the strategy space. The dominant
strategy ensures that changes in contributions are attributable to the
tax directly, rather than second-order effects due to responses to
out-of-equilibrium play by other agents. The dominant strategy is made
more transparent by the use of a novel graphical decision interface. We
find that individuals robustly choose at or above the own-earnings
dominant strategy level. Even with the controls of the design, crowd-out
is incomplete, but the degree of crowd-out is higher than in previous
studies. Analysis of individual-level decisions provides evidence of
different player types. Behavior of subjects not choosing the dominant
or Pareto-efficient contributions is well-organized by a model of
warm-glow giving with a logit decision error. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

"{We examine experimentally how and why voluntary contributions are
affected by sequentiality. Instead of deciding simultaneously in each
round, subjects are randomly ordered in a sequence which differs from
round to round. We compare sessions in which subjects observe the
contributions from earlier decisions in each round (sequential treatment
with information) to sessions in which subjects decide sequentially
within rounds, but cannot observe earlier contributions (sequential
treatment without information). We also investigate whether average
contributions are affected by the length of the sequence by varying
group size. Our results show that sequentiality alone has no effect on
contributions, but that the level of contributions increases when
subjects are informed about the contributions of lower-ranked subjects.
We provide evidence that the so-called leadership effect vanishes within
rounds, and that group size has no significant impact on the average
level of contributions in our sequential contribution games. (JEL C92,

equilibrium and the Lindahl equilibrium, respectively, were computed
from the individual private good valuations and compared with the
subjects' actual contributions. We found a significant positive
correlation between private good valuations in terms of
willingness-to-pay and public good valuations in terms of voluntary
contributions. Group contributions to public waiting time reduction
significantly exceeded the non-cooperative prediction and were close to
the socially optimal level. However, for a majority of subjects, the
Lindahl equilibrium was not able to predict the observed contributions.}"

find that, in the aggregate, contributions are lower when feedback on
earnings is provided compared to when feedback on contributions is
provided. We also find that there exist substantial but intuitively
appealing differences in the way individuals react to feedback.
Particularly, individuals with a high propensity to contribute tend to
imitate the highest contributor more often and are more inclined to
obtain feedback about individual contributions compared to individuals
with a lower propensity to contribute. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"{This article discusses voluntary contributions to health education in

suggests that donor paternalism, undermining the agency of beneficiaries
to exercise control over funds, is not always necessary to guarantee
investment in local public goods. We explore multiple interpretations,

"{Previous experimental and observational work suggests that people act
more generously when they are observed and observe others in social
settings. However, the explanation for this is unclear. An individual
may want to send a signal of her generosity to improve her own
reputation. Alternately ( or additionally) she may value the public good
or charity itself and, believing that contribution levels are strategic
complements, give more to influence others to give more. We perform the
first series of laboratory experiments that can separately estimate the
impact of these two social effects, and test whether realized influence
is consistent with the desire to influence, and whether either of these
are consistent with anticipated influence. Our experimental subjects
were given the opportunity to contribute from their endowment to Bread
for the World, a development NGO. Depending on treatment, ``leader{''}
subjects' donations were reported to other subjects either anonymously
or with their identities, and these were reported either before these
``follower{''} subjects made their donation decisions. We find that
``leaders{''} are influential only when their identities are revealed
along with their donations, and female leaders are more influential than
males. Identified leaders' predictions suggest that are aware of their
influence. They respond to this by giving more than either the control
group or the unidentified leaders. We find mixed evidence for
``reputation-seeking.{''}}"
"{We examine voluntary contributions in a two-stage public good experiment
with `carryover.' In two treatments, each subject's second-stage
endowment is determined by the return from the public good in the
first-stage. We manipulate payoffs across treatments such that, relative
to our no-carryover baseline, earnings from either Nash Equilibrium
(constant NE) play or Pareto Optimal (constant PO) play are held
constant. The remaining two treatments maintain a constant endowment in
each stage, but vary the marginal per capita return (MPCR high or MCPR
low) to contributions in the second-stage. Our results indicate that
carryover increases first-stage contributions. Our implementation of
carryover enables us to examine the effects of changing endowments and a
wide range of MPCR's. Consistent with the literature, we find that MPCR
and endowment effects are important determinants of subject
contributions to the group account. While stage 1 contributions tend to
increase in the presence of carryover, efficiency levels across both
stages fall relative to the baseline. Efficiency levels fall because the
maximum earnings possible increase with carryover (due to higher

"{We consider a voluntary contributions game, in which players may punish
others after contributions are made and observed. The productivity of
contributions, as captured in the marginal-per-capita return, differs
among individuals, so that there are two types: high and low
productivity. Every two or eight periods, depending on the treatment,
individuals vote on a punishment regime, in which certain individuals
are permitted, but not required, to have punishment directed toward
them. The punishment system can condition on type and contribution
history. The results indicate that the most effective regime, in terms
of contributions and earnings, is one that allows punishment of low
contributors only, regardless of productivity. Nevertheless, only a
minority of sessions converge to this system, indicating a tendency for
the voting process to lead to suboptimal institutional choice.}"
"{In this paper, we examine voluntary contributions to a public good,
embedding Varian's (1994) voluntary contribution game in extended games
that allow players to choose the timing of their contributions. We show
that predicted outcomes are sensitive to the structure of the extended
game, and also to the extent to which players care about payoff
inequalities. We then report a laboratory experiment based on these
extended games. We find that behavior is similar in the two extended
games: subjects avoid the detrimental move order of Varian's model,
where a person with a high value of the public good commits to a low
contribution, and instead players tend to delay contributions. These
results suggest that commitment opportunities may be less damaging to
public good provision than previously thought.}"
"{We use a sequential voluntary contribution game to compare the relative
impact of a first-mover's non-binding announcement versus binding
commitment on cooperation. We find that a non-binding announcement and a
binding commitment increase individual contributions to a similar
extent. Since announced contributions systematically exceed commitments,
in sessions with a non-binding announcement, second-movers tend to
contribute more to the group activity than in sessions with a binding
commitment. Yet, second-movers appear to be more motivated towards
achieving a social optimum when the first-mover uses commitment. We also
find that a non-binding announcement has a higher impact on individual
propensity to cooperate than the ex post contribution of the
first-mover. However, the failure to make announced contributions
decreases cooperation even though the first-mover is reassigned in every
period.}"
"{The burgeoning literature on the use of sanctions to support the
provision of public goods has largely neglected the use of formal or
centralized sanctions. We let subjects playing a linear public goods
game vote on the parameters of a formal sanction scheme capable of
either resolving or exacerbating the free-rider problem, depending on
parameter settings. Most groups quickly learned to choose parameters
inducing efficient outcomes. We find that cooperative orientation,
political attitude, gender and intelligence have a small but sometimes
significant influence on voting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"{Voluntary contribution mechanism to public goods is one of the
traditional types of economic experiments. The article summarizes the
results of series of experiments that have been conducted with several
groups of Czech university students. Using the threshold mechanism the
impact of several factors (experience, communication and the form of
experiment) on voluntary contribution to public goods is tested. The
results confirm, to a great extent, findings published by foreign
studies. The results show that Czech students also do not behave
consistently with the traditional economic public goods model, i.e. they
cooperate voluntarily in situations that favour free riding. Threshold

can be regarded as one of the most successful modifications of the
voluntary contribution mechanism to public good. Experiments involving
Czech students indicate that such technique can be successful even in

"{This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation of
dynamic games in net works. In each period, the subjects simultaneously
choose whether or not to make, irreversible contribution to the
provision of an indivisible public good. Subjects observe the past
actions of other subjects if and only if they are connected by the
network. NE works may be incomplete so subjects are asymmetrically
informed about the actions other subjects in the same network, which is
typically an obstacle to the attainment of efficient outcome. For all
networks, the game has a large set of (possibly inefficient) equilibrium
outcomes. Nonetheless, the network architecture makes certain strategies
salie and this in turn facilitates coordination on efficient outcomes.
In particular, asymmetric in the network architecture encourage two
salient behaviors, strategic delay and strategic commitment. By
contrast, we find that symmetries in the network architecture can lead
mis-coordination and inefficient outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

"{Alchian and Demsetz's influential explanation of the classical business
firm (The American Economic Review, 1972, 62, 777-795) argues that there
is need for a concentrated residual claim in the hands of a central
agent, to motivate the monitoring of workers. We model monitoring as a
way to transform team production from a collective action dilemma with
strong free riding incentives to a productivity-enhancing opportunity
with strong private marginal incentives to contribute effort. In an
experiment, we have subjects experience team production without
monitoring, team production with a central monitor, and team production
with peer monitoring. Then subjects vote on whether to employ the
central monitor, who gets to keep a fixed share of the team output, or
to rely on peer monitoring, which entails a coordination or free riding
problem. Our subjects usually prefer peer monitoring but they switch to
the specialist when unable to successfully self-monitor. We provide
evidence for situations in which team members resist the appointing of a
central monitor and succeed in overcoming coordination and free riding
problems as well as for a situation in which an Alchian-Demsetz-like
firm grows in the laboratory.}"
"{This paper shows that the presence of different types of players - those
who only care about their own material payoffs and those who reciprocate
others' contributions - can explain the robust features of observed
contribution patterns in public good contribution games, even without
the presence of asymmetric information. We show what conditions on
reciprocity are sufficient for a unique perfect equilibrium, in which
contributions are decreasing. Under these conditions, selfish players
have enough future benefits to induce subsequent contributions by
reciprocal players, and this incentive diminishes as the end of the game
approaches. The model explains the puzzling restart effect and is
consistent with various other empirical findings. We also report the
results of a series of experiments, using a probabilistic continuation
design in which after each set of 10-period games, the group is
restarted with low probability. We find specific support for the theory
in our data, including that selfish players (identified exogenously)
stop contributing earlier than reciprocal players, as directly implied
by the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{This paper examines the role of status acquisition as a motive for
giving in voluntary contributions to public goods. In particular, every
donor's status is given by the difference between his contribution and
that of the other donor. Specifically, I show that contributors give
more than in standard models where status is not considered, their
donation is increasing in the value they assign to status and, under
certain conditions, in the value that their opponents assign to status
(reflecting donors' competition to gain social status). Furthermore, I
consider contributors' equilibrium strategies both in simultaneous and
sequential contribution mechanisms. Then, I compare total contributions
in both of these mechanisms. I find that the simultaneous contribution
order generates higher total contributions than the sequential mechanism
only when donors are sufficiently homogeneous in the value they assign
to status. Otherwise, the sequential mechanism generates the highest
contributions.}"
"{The collective action problem around water use and management involves
solving both the problems of provision and appropriation. Cooperation in
the provision can be affected by the rival nature of appropriation and
the asymmetries in access. We report the results of two field
experiments conducted in Colombia and Kenya. The irrigation game was
used to explore the provision and appropriation decisions under
asymmetric or sequential appropriation, complemented by a voluntary
contribution mechanism experiment which looks at provision decisions
under symmetric appropriation. The overall results were consistent with
the patterns of previous studies: the zero contribution hypotheses is
rejected whereas the most effective institution to increase cooperation
was face-to-face communication, although we find that communication
works much more effectively in Colombia than in Kenya. We also find that
the asymmetric appropriation did reduce cooperation, though the
magnitude of the social loss and the effectiveness of alternative
institutional options varied across sites.}"
"{The public phase of a capital campaign is typically launched with the
announcement of a large seed donation. Andreoni (1998) argues that such
a fundraising strategy may be particularly effective when funds are
being raised for projects that have fixed production costs. The reason
is that when there are fixed costs of production simultaneous giving may
result in both positive and zero provision equilibria. Thus absent
announcements donors may get stuck in an equilibrium that fails to
provide a desirable public project Andreoni (1998) demonstrates that
such inferior outcomes can be eliminated when the fundraiser initially
secures a sufficiently large seed donation. We investigate this model
experimentally to determine whether announcements of seed money
eliminate the inefficiencies that may result under fixed costs and
simultaneous provision. To assess the strength of the theory we examine
the effect of announcements in both the presence and absence of fixed
costs. Our findings are supportive of the theory for sufficiently high
fixed costs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Andreoni (1995) showed that pure framing effects may influence
contribution in Voluntary Contribution Mechanisms (VCM) by comparing a
standard public goods game, called the positive frame condition (giving
to the public good), with a negative frame condition (taking from the
public good) where the subjects' choice to purchase a private good makes
the other subjects worse off. This paper aims at testing the robustness
of such framing effects in the context of Provision Point Mechanisms
(PPM). Our approach is original in that it combines both framing and
provision point dimensions by comparing maintaining (taking from the
public good) and creating (giving to the public good) contexts using
Provision Point experiments. Consistent with previous findings, we find
that individuals tend to be less cooperative in the maintaining frame
than in the creating frame. Our results also show that the framing
effects are stronger under a PPM than under a VCM and increase with the
provision point level. These results may have important consequences for
the management of environmental resources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

"{We introduce two variants of the one-shot joy-of-destruction minigame
(mini-JOD). Two players are endowed with the same amount of money. They
simultaneously decide whether or not to reduce the other player's payoff
at an own cost. In one treatment there was a probability that nature
would destroy the opponent's money anyway. We test whether this feature
reduces the moral costs of nastiness, and find that destruction rates
rise significantly, despite the absence of strategic reasons. (JEL C72,

as a competitive environment in which payoffs result from individuals'
relative performances. Our results indicate that trust and the

"{We examine theoretically and experimentally how competitive
contribution-based group formation affects incentives to free-ride. We
introduce a new formal model of social production, called a
``Group-based Meritocracy Mechanism{''} (GBM), which extends the
single-group-level analysis of a Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM)
to multiple groups. In a GBM individuals are ranked according to their
group contributions. Based on this ranking, participants are then
partitioned into equal-sized groups. Members of each group share their
collective output equally amongst themselves according to a VCM payoff
function. The GBM has two pure-strategy Nash equilibria. One is
non-contribution by all; this equilibrium thus coincides with the VCM's
equilibrium. The second equilibrium is close to Pareto optimal. It is
asymmetric and quite complex from the viewpoint of experimental
subjects, yet subjects tacitly coordinate this equilibrium reliably and
precisely. Extensions of the basic GBM model to incorporate various
features of naturally occurring group formation are suggested in the
conclusion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Environmental policy design has much to gain from a better understanding
of existing voluntary behaviour and motivations. In laboratory
experiments, participants often exhibit social preferences such as
altruism, spite, reciprocity and notions of fairness. In contrast,
traditional neoclassical theory assumes that people act rationally in a
way that maximises their self-interest. In environmental markets, social
preferences and self-interest interact. We apply experimental economics
to test the hypothesis that social preferences are not maintained in the
presence of a competitive market institution. In the initial public
goods game, many participants were prepared to make costly voluntary
contributions. However the introduction of the market institution
triggered a `market instinct' in experimental participants. They
abandoned the social preferences they were previously expressing and
became self-interested profit maximisers. This self-interested behaviour
persisted even after the market institution was discontinued. These
findings are important to understanding the role and impact of markets
for environmental policy.}"
"{We analyse an experimental public goods game in which group members can
endogenously determine whether they want to supplement a standard
voluntary contribution mechanism with the possibility of rewarding or
punishing other group members. We find a significantly positive effect
of endogenous institutional choice on the level of cooperation in
comparison to the same exogenously implemented institutions. This
suggests that participation rights enhance cooperation in groups. With
endogenous choice, groups typically vote for the reward option, although
punishment is even more effective in sustaining high levels of
cooperation. Our results are evaluated against the predictions of social
preference models.}"
"{This article investigates fund-raising mechanisms based on a prize as a
way to overcome free riding in the private provision of public goods. We
focus on an environment characterised by income heterogeneity and
incomplete information about income levels. Our analysis compares
experimentally the performance of a lottery, an all-pay auction and a
benchmark voluntary contribution mechanism. We find that prize-based
mechanisms perform better than voluntary contribution in terms of public
good provision. Contrary to the theoretical predictions, contributions
are significantly higher in the lottery than in the all-pay auction,
both overall and by individual income types.}"
"{Whether motivated by reciprocity or conformity, imitation is common in
public good contexts. We consider the incentive for an agent to
contribute to a public good if he expects imitation from others. Using a
sequential public good game with exogenous ordering, we show that agents
early enough in the sequence who believe imitation to be sufficiently
likely would want to contribute. By contributing, they expect total
contributions to increase significantly. We also show that preferences
determine how early an agent need be, that the observed share of
imitators in experiments is sufficiently high to warrant contribution
and that an increase in group size reduces the incentive to contribute.}"
"{Fundraisers often start their campaigns by soliciting the wealthier,
more recognized, and respected individuals in a community. We examine
whether the success of this solicitation ordering in part can be
attributed to the fact that it enables individuals to select
organizations that have a high-status donor base. Assuming that
individuals prefer to associate with individuals of higher social
ranking we use a simple linear model to show that both aggregate
donations and earnings are larger when high-status donors are solicited
first. We investigate the predicted comparative statics using the
experimental laboratory. Inducing a status differential we reverse the
contribution ordering between participants of high and low status.
Consistent with current fundraising practice, we find that low-status
followers are likely to mimic donations by high-status leaders and this
encourages high-status leaders to give. Donations are therefore larger
when individuals of high status give before rather than after those of
low status.}"
"{In large-scale fundraising campaigns based on direct mailings, typically
less than 5\% of individuals donate to the charitable cause. We present
evidence from two field experiments designed to measure the existence of
transaction costs that inhibit charitable giving in such fundraising
campaigns, and shed light on the nature of such transaction costs. The
experiments are designed in conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera
House. The first mail-out experiment was implemented over two stages
using a within-subject design. We develop a theoretical framework that
makes precise the identifying assumptions under which we can exploit
this two-stage design to measure the following structural parameters
among potential donors: (i) the share of donors who would make a
strictly positive donation in the complete absence of transaction costs
and (ii) the probability that a potential donor has sufficiently low
transactions costs to make a strictly positive donation. Our results
imply response rates to mail-out solicitations would almost double in
the complete absence of transaction costs. The second field experiment
provides more evidence on the nature of transaction costs. We
distinguish between ex ante transaction costs, which prevent the choice
problem from being considered and ex post transaction costs, which
prevent choices being implemented. We find that the likelihood of a
donation being made increases by 26\% in response to even a small
reduction in ex post transaction costs.}"

"{We use a public-good experiment to analyze behavior in a decentralized
asymmetric punishment institution, The institution is asymmetric in the
sense that players differ in the effectiveness of their punishment. At
the aggregate level, we observe remarkable similarities between outcomes
in asymmetric and symmetric punishment institutions. Controlling for the
average punishment effectiveness of the institutions, we find that
asymmetric punishment institutions are as effective in fostering
cooperation and are as efficient as symmetric institutions. At the
individual level, we find that players with higher punishment
effectiveness contribute similar amounts to the public account but have
higher earnings and punish more than their weak counterparts.}"

clearly negative impact on the disposition towards others and on the
experienced well-being of those on the long side. Since subjective
well-being improves only for those on the short side rivalry contributes
to larger inequalities in experienced well-being. All in all rivalry
does not show up as a positive force in our environment. (C) 2009

incentive problems and sustaining coordination in work teams.
Explanations of the motivation to punish generally rely either on small
group size or on a Folk theorem that requires coordinated punishment

player. We provide a model of team production in which the punishment of
shirkers depends on strong reciprocity: the willingness of some team
members to contribute altruistically to a joint project and also to bear
costs in order to discipline fellow members who do not contribute. This
alternative does not require small group size, complex coordinated
punishing activities, or implausible informational assumptions. An

votes and periods of learning we found a distinct reluctance to allow
any punishment at the beginning, with a gradual but clear evolution
toward allowing punishment of low contributors. And groups allowing

"{This paper considers how six alternative rebate rules affect voluntary
contributions in a threshold public-good experiment. The rules differ by
(1) whether an individual can receive a proportional rebate of excess
contributions, a winner-takes-all of any excess contributions, or a full
rebate of one's contribution in the event the public good is provided
and excess contributions exist, and (2) whether the probability of
receiving a rebate is proportional to an individual's contribution
relative to total contributions or is a simple uniform probability
distribution set by the number of contributors. The paper adds to the
existing experimental economics literature on threshold public goods by
investigating both aggregate and individual demand revelation under the
winner-take-all and random full-rebate rules. Half of the rules
(proportional rebate, winner-take-all with uniform probability among all
group members, and random full-rebate with uniform probability) provide
total contributions that nearly equal total benefits, while the rest
(winner-take-all with proportional probability, winner-take-all with
uniform probability among contributors only, and random full-rebate with
proportional probability) exceed benefits by over 30\%. Only the
proportional rebate rule is found to achieve both aggregate and
individual demand revelation. Our experimental results have implications
for both fundraisers and valuation practitioners. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"{Understanding the proximate and ultimate sources of human cooperation is
a fundamental issue in all behavioural sciences. In this paper, we
review the experimental evidence on how people solve cooperation
problems. Existing studies show without doubt that direct and indirect
reciprocity are important determinants of successful cooperation. We
also discuss the insights from a large literature on the role of peer
punishment in sustaining cooperation. The experiments demonstrate that
many people are `strong reciprocators' who are willing to cooperate and
punish others even if there are no gains from future cooperation or any
other reputational gains. We document this in new one-shot experiments,
which we conducted in four cities in Russia and Switzerland. Our
cross-cultural approach allows us furthermore to investigate how the
cultural background influences strong reciprocity. Our results show that
culture has a strong influence on positive and in especially strong
negative reciprocity. In particular, we find large cross-cultural
differences in `antisocial punishment' of pro-social cooperators.
Further cross-cultural research and experiments involving different
socio-demographic groups document that the antisocial punishment is much
more widespread than previously assumed. Understanding antisocial
punishment is an important task for future research because antisocial
punishment is a strong inhibitor of cooperation.}"
"{This paper provides a comparative-statics analysis of punishment in
public-good experiments. We vary the effectiveness of punishment, that
is, the factor by which punishment reduces the punished player's income.
The data show that contributions increase monotonically in punishment
effectiveness. High effectiveness leads to near complete cooperation and
welfare improvements. Below a certain threshold, however, punishment
cannot prevent the decay of cooperation. In these cases, punishment
opportunities reduce welfare. The results suggest that the
experimenter's choice of the punishment effectiveness is of great
importance for the experimental outcome.}"
"{Contributions to public goods can be motivated by intrinsic factors such
as warm glow altruism and fairness, as well as extrinsic incentives Such
as sanctions and payments. However, psychological Studies suggest that
formal extrinsic incentives may crowd out intrinsic motivations. In an
experimental study of individual contributions to a public good we find
that suasion crowded in Voluntary contributions. while an extrinsic
incentive in the form of a regulation led to crowding out. This has
implications for the design of public policy where ranges of motivations

"{Although it is widely recognized that sanction increases cooperation in
a public good game, comparatively little attention has been paid to a
scenario in which agents have heterogeneous productivities (i.e.
asymmetric impact on the group account). This paper examines the extent
to which sanction works in this scenario by varying marginal per capita
return (MPCR) among group members. Experimental results indicate that in
the absence of sanctions, productivity heterogeneity hampers
cooperation. Allowing punishment in these groups significantly enhances
average contributions of group members, but does not increase welfare.
In groups in which cooperation is highly successful, high-productivity
agents actively punish low-productivity agents in initial periods.
However, conditional on individual contributions, high-productivity
agents receive more punishment, and behave more responsively by raising
their contributions in the next period. The results mirror the reality
in which elites in a society are under higher pressure, since their
choices are likely to have a deeper impact on a society.}"
"{We investigated the importance of the social context for people's
voluntary contributions to a national park in Costa Rica, using a
natural field experiment. Some subjects make actual contributions while
others state their hypothetical contribution. Both the degree of
anonymity and information provided about the contributions of others
influence subject contributions in the hypothesized direction. We found
a substantial hypothetical bias with regard to the amount contributed.
However, the influence of the social contexts is about the same when the
subjects make actual monetary contributions as when they state their
hypothetical contributions. Our results have important implications for
validity testing of stated preference methods: a comparison between
hypothetical and actual behavior should be done for a given social
context.}"

"{The tontine, which is an interesting mixture of group annuity, group
life insurance, and lottery, has a peculiar place in economic history.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it played a major role in
raising funds to finance public goods in Europe, but today it is rarely
encountered outside of a dusty footnote in actuarial course notes or as
a means to thicken the plot of a murder mystery. This study provides a
formal model of individual contribution decisions under a modem variant
of the historical tontine mechanism that is easily implemented by
private charities. Our model incorporates desirable properties of the
historical tontine to develop a mechanism to fund the private provision
of a public good. The tontine-like mechanism we derive is predicted to
outperform not only the voluntary contribution mechanism but also
another widely used mechanism: charitable lotteries. Our experimental
test of the instrument provides some evidence of the beneficial effects
associated with implementing tontine-like schemes. We find that the
mechanism has particular power in cases where agents are risk-averse or
in situations where substantial asymmetries characterize individual

cooperation, but if voters can punish violators, contributions increase
significantly. While costly punishment increases contributions at the
price of lower efficiency, overall efficiency for a voting-with
punishment rule still exceeds the level observed for a
voting-without-punishment rule.}"
"{Rarely, if ever. do parties contemplating a joint project commit

equilibrium of this game is improved when a prior stage of communication
is allowed. Interestingly, this improvement can be achieved in ``simple
equilibria{''} where a player simply announces whether (not how much)

With symmetric priors, the simple equilibrium that maximizes either
utilitarian ex ante welfare or the probability of completion has a

differences in group outcomes can be predicted by knowing the types of

"{The goal of this research is to understand how generalized exchange
systems emerge when information, as the object of exchange, produces a
collective good. When individuals contribute information for a
collective benefit, it can create a group-generalized exchange system
that involves a social dilemma. I argue that two properties of
information, replication and high jointness of supply, are crucial for
understanding the nature of the social dilemma in these exchange
systems. Combined with low-cost contributions, these special features of
information can allow social psychological selective incentives to
significantly encourage cooperation. Experiments were conducted to
examine the independent effects of two social psychological selective
incentives (social approval and observational cooperation) on sharing
behavior in a generalized information exchange system. The results
indicate that observing high levels of cooperative behavior is
beneficial in the short run, but ultimately it only leads to moderately
higher levels of cooperation than when individuals cannot observe
cooperative behavior. On the other hand, when individuals receive either
high or low levels of social approval, it has a very positive,
significant impact on cooperative behavior This research has
implications for real-world generalized information exchange systems
such as those found on the Internet. In addition, the theory and results
in this study can also be extended to public goods that share the
features of low-costs contributions, replication, and high jointness of
supply.}"
"{In public goods experiments, stochastic choice, censoring and
motivational heterogeneity give scope for disagreement over the extent
of unselfishness, and whether it is reciprocal or altruistic. We show
that these problems can be addressed econometrically, by estimating a
finite mixture model to isolate types, incorporating double censoring
and a tremble term. Most subjects act selfishly, but a substantial
proportion are reciprocal with altruism playing only a marginal role.
Isolating reciprocators enables a test of Sugden's model of voluntary
contributions. We estimate that reciprocators display a self-serving
bias relative to the model.}"

Empirical results are in line with our theory: in gross terms, the
lotteries raised more money than the voluntary contributions treatments.
Interestingly, in terms of both maximizing current contributions and
inducing participation, we find that a one-standard deviation increase
in female solicitor physical attractiveness is similar to that of the

"{Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether the mandatory fees
imposed by the beef checkoff violates the First Amendment. As a
precaution, many states began forming voluntary beef checkoffs, where
funds would be raised through voluntary contributions. This study
conducted a survey of Oklahoma cattle producers to determine what type
of voluntary checkoff design would receive the greatest support. The
most popular checkoff placed a large emphasis on advertising and a
slightly lower checkoff fee. The survey also tested the ability of a
provision point mechanism to limit free-riding. The mechanism was not as
effective as in other studies which used laboratory experiments.}"
"{Economic behavior often takes place in small groups of people
interacting with each other (like work teams and boards of directors,
but also social networks and neighborhoods). Characteristic of such
interaction is the development of (affective) interpersonal
relationships, or social ties. The embeddedness of economic behavior in
networks of social ties seems to have a profound impact on the outcome
of economic processes. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the
development of social ties structures through economic interaction in a
public good environment. It turns out that complicated dynamics arise
from individual differences in social value orientation and affective
response patterns. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{We study a linear public goods game using an inter-generational
approach. Subjects in one generation leave advice for the succeeding
generation via free-form messages. Such advice can be private knowledge
(advice left by one player in generation t is given only to his or her
immediate successor in generation t + 1), public knowledge (advice left
by players of generation t is made available to all members of
generation t + 1), and common knowledge (where the advice is not only
public but is also read aloud by the experimenter). Common knowledge of
advice generates a process of social learning that leads to high
contributions and less free-riding. This behaviour is sustained by
advice that is generally exhortative, suggesting high contributions,
which in turn creates optimistic beliefs among subjects about others'
contributions. We suggest that socially connected communities may
achieve high contributions to a public good even in the absence of
punishment for norm violators.}"

"{Little progress has been made toward understanding the relative
performance of the two mechanisms most widely used for fundraising: the
Voluntary Contribution (VCM) and Provision Point (PPM) mechanisms. This
paper provides direct comparisons of the relative performance of
variants of the VCM and PPM as they are most commonly implemented in the
field. The research makes use of 1296 individual observations from 721
subjects, including 40 observations from a field experiment. A
meta-analysis of the determinants of contribution levels and bootstrap
estimates of the relative efficiency of the two mechanisms provide novel
analyses of public goods experimental data. Overall, the PPM is found to
increase total contributions, to be more responsive to changes in
induced value, and to be generally more efficient than the VCM. For
public goods with a benefit-cost ratio in the interval {[}1, 1.4),
however, the VCM captures a greater portion of available benefits than

"{Unlike other species, humans cooperate in large, distantly related
groups, a fact that has long presented a puzzle to biologists. The
pathway by which adaptations for large-scale cooperation among nonkin
evolved in humans remains a subject of vigorous debate. Results from
theoretical analyses and agent-based simulations suggest that
evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but can
instead generate a polymorphic population that consists of individuals
who vary in their degree of cooperativeness. These results resonate with
the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of individual
differences in understanding and modeling behavior and dynamics in
experimental games and decision problems. Here, we report the results of
laboratory experiments that complement both theory and simulation
results. We find that our subjects fall into three types, an
individual's type is stable, and a group's cooperative outcomes can be
remarkably well predicted if one knows its type composition. Reciprocal
types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their
beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63\%) of
players; cooperators and free-riders are also present in our subject
population. Despite substantial behavioral differences, earnings among
types are statistically identical. Our results support the view that our
human subject population is in a stable, polymorphic equilibrium of
types.}"
"{We explore by purely experimental means a heterogeneous agents scenario
in experimental public goods games, assuming the existence of at least
three types of player: free riders, cooperators, and reciprocators. We
identify the various types by means of four classification methods, and
then play the public goods game with homogeneous groups. We observe that
(1) the average contribution level is enhanced in this setting; (2) the
decay phenomenon is replicated in groups of `pure' free riders, whereas
in groups of cooperative and reciprocating players the contribution is
high and fairly stable throughout the game.}"

"{A burgeoning literature in experimental studies of the Voluntary
Contribution Mechanism focuses on the ability of institutions that allow
the monitoring, sanctioning, and/or rewarding of others to facilitate
cooperation. In this paper rewards and sanctions are examined in a
one-shot VCM setting that so far has been unexplored in the literature.
The study finds that while some subjects are willing to reward and
sanction others at a personal cost, the opportunity to reward or
sanction is ineffective in facilitating cooperation relative to previous
experiments in which a repeated game environment is employed. The study
also compares behavior in an environment in which the imposition of
rewards and sanctions is certain to an environment in which imposition
is uncertain. The expected value of the reward or sanction is kept
constant across environments to focus simply on the effect of
uncertainty about imposition. Uncertainty does not change behavior in a
significant way, either in the level of cooperation or the willingness
of individuals to impose rewards or sanctions.}"
"{Using the real-time protocol of play-a relatively new experimental
mechanism in which the order of play and timing of decisions are
determined endogenously-we investigate voluntary contributions to the
provision of pure public goods. We consider the case where the good is
binary, players are asymmetric, communication is prohibited, and
all-or-none contributions to the public good can be withdrawn at any
time during the round of play. Our results: (1) support an equilibrium
in which contributors maximize the sum of their own payoffs; (2) show
considerably higher levels of contribution than under the more commonly
used simultaneous protocol of play; and (3) exhibit no decrease in level
of contribution across multiple iterations of the stage game. On
comparing our results to those of Goren et al. (2003), we conclude that
modifying the mechanism so that contributions once made cannot be
revoked yields significantly higher levels of contribution over the
course of the game. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}"

"{This study investigated the effect of group size uncertainty in a
single-stage step-level common pool resource dilemma under a sequential

uncertain group size condition, participants were told that their group

the certain group size condition, the group size was always five. In the
SEQ protocol, decisions were made in a pre-specified order such that
each player knew his or her position in the sequence, as well as the
combined requests of all the preceding players in the sequence. In the
SPS protocol, participants could choose when to make their decisions. In
both protocols, we replicated the position effects-individual requests
are inversely related to the players' positions in the sequence with the
first mover requesting most, and the last mover requesting the least. We
also found that the position effect was stronger in SEQ than in SPS, and
when group size was certain than when it was not. Relative to group size
certainty, group size uncertainty decreased total requests and increased

"{Are decisions in economics experiments distorted because the money
subjects risk comes from the experimenter rather than their own pockets?
There is some evidence that people receiving small, one time ``windfall

doing so, exhibit greater risk-seeking behaviour. This has been found in
individual decision making experiments when anticipated wealth effects
have been controlled, and labelled the ``house money effect.{''} In
public good experiments, house money effects could be driving the high
levels of voluntary contributions commonly observed. This possibility is
tested by comparing VCM contribution rates when subjects supply their
own endowments with those when endowments are provided, while holding
constant the distribution of promised earnings. No evidence of house
money effects is found, suggesting that use of ``free{''} initial money
endowments does not distort subsequent contributions in VCM

a cross-cultural experiment conducted in the United States and Japan.
Our environment differs from the standard voluntary contribution
mechanism because subjects first decide whether or not to participate in
providing this non-excludable public good. This participation decision
is conveyed to the other subject prior to the subjects' contribution
decisions. We find that only the American data are consistent with the
evolutionary-stable-strategy Nash equilibrium predictions, and that
behavior is significantly different across countries. Japanese subjects
are more likely to act spitefully in the early periods of the
experiment, even though our design changes subject pairings each period
so that no two subjects ever interact twice. Surprisingly, this spiteful
behavior eventually leads to more efficient public good contributions
for Japanese subjects than for American subjects.}"

"{Generic advertising promotes the general qualities of a product category

such campaigns organized through voluntary contributions by firms are
found in the Life Insurance, ( `'It's 1998. You're Dead. What Do You Do
Now? `') and Steel industries (''The New Steel. Feel the strength.'').
Free-riding is commonly observed in such campaigns when they use the
Simple Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM)- here the budget is
obtained by simply adding up the voluntary contributions of firms. We
propose a new mechanism called the Provision Point VCM that can help
alleviate this free-riding problem. Here, a target budget called the
provision point is announced with the condition that the campaign will
be mounted if and only if the contributions equal or exceed this point,
First, analytically we briefly describe the results for the Simple VCM.
Here, free-riding will always result in equilibrium and the advertising
budget never maximizes industry welfare. Then, we show that if the
provision point is set equal to the Pareto Optimum, the industry welfare
maximizing advertising budget is always a feasible equilibrium outcome
and is a unique outcome in some cases. In fact, we show that no other
Provision Point VCM can lead to welfare maximization.
Then, we present results from experiments using MBA students that test
these findings. Consistent with our analytical results, we show that
when the provision point is set equal to the Pareto Optimum, it
outperforms the Simple VCM in terms of overall contributions and
free-riding behavior.}"

concept, in the context of a threshold public good, the Step Return
(SR). After providing a recta-analysis of the effect of SR in previous

scope remain relatively rare in contingent valuation studies involving
nonuse values, especially when combined with other tests of validity and
reliability using the same sampling frame and survey instrument. Thus,
corollary tests of sensitivity in valuation responses to information

"Recently, the personality factor of Honesty–Humility has attracted substantial attention. In particular, it has not only been shown to predict several criteria, but also to entail a specific pattern of interaction with situational factors. Herein, we extend previous research on both findings in linking Honesty–Humility to the quintessential social dilemma, the prisoner’s dilemma. In three investigations, we found support that those high in Honesty–Humility were more likely to cooperate—so long as this was sensible in any way. Those low in Honesty–Humility, by contrast, tended to defect—especially when this behavior was very tempting but not risky. Thus, Honesty–Humility shows promise as a crucial basic personality variable predicting social dilemma decision making, especially in interaction with situational factors.

"Different disciplines have analyzed binary choices to model collective behavior in human systems. Several situations in which social dilemmas arise can be modeled as N-person prisoner’s dilemma games including homeland security, public goods, international political economy among others. The purpose of this study is to develop an analytical solution to the N-person prisoner’s dilemma game when boundedly rational agents interact in a population. Previous studies in the literature consider the case in which cooperators and defectors have the same learning factors. We obtain an analytical equation to find equilibria in the N-person prisoner’s dilemma game in the general case when agents have different learning factors. We also introduce a more realistic approach where probability values are bounded between zero and one and therefore eliminates the possibility of infeasible probability values. Since no analytic solution can be derived in this case, agent based simulation is used to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the resulted dynamical system.

"This paper illustrates how the payoff matrices of the single group Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) and the Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) differentially reinforce cooperation when participants care about relative performance. Examples of particular payoff patterns and thought experiments using a computational simulation demonstrate that withholding cooperation is not always the dominant strategy in the IPD. In the intergroup structure, three conditions differentially reinforce cooperation. When competing groups have equal numbers of cooperators, withholding cooperation is always the dominant strategy just as in the single group structure. In contrast, when one group has more cooperators than the other group, cooperation by its members can dominate withholding cooperation by members of the other group. Thus, the relative advantage of one group over another increases the payoff for cooperation in some configurations of the IPD over the payoff in the PD. Relative payoff is thus an untheorized variable motivating cooperation in the IPD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The goal of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of psychological factors on a decision-making game, and to determine the implications of these effects in regards to public policy and law. Prisoner's Dilemmas are situations where people must make decisions on present and long-term consequences. Game theorists utilize games, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, to model matters of public policy and law, and mathematically solve those games to determine how a decision should be made. However, laboratory experiments have shown that players often play these games based on non-rational models of logic. The author conducted an extensive review of the literature and chose four psychological paradigms relevant for laboratory-conducted Prisoner's Dilemma games: nonconscious goal activation, relative risk aversion, task appraisals, and Machiavellianism. All four paradigms are directly related to decision-making when emotion, uncertainty, personality, or cognitive capabilities are factors. 97 participants completed a nonconscious goal activation task, and then played a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game. Players also completed a relative risk aversion choice task, a Machiavellianism scale, task appraisal questions, and demographic questions. The researcher coded the players' action sets (game choices) into nine separate domains for analysis. The nonconscious goal activation task had a significant effect on the length of games, number of cooperative choices, strategies played, new game attempts, and total points earned. Machiavellianism was a significant predictor of length of games, number of cooperative choices, initial and actual strategy choices, propensities to reset the game, and earned points. Risk aversion was a significant predictor of strategy adherence. Lastly, task appraisals were significant predictors of three domains, all related to the propensity of the player to reset a game after ending it. All four psychological paradigms were found to be relevant to decision-making in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game. Findings from this study have established the framework for further research into the effects of goals, personalities, risk propensities, and cognitive task appraisal for consideration when utilizing Prisoner's Dilemma games to develop and analyze psychological aspects of public policy and law. Implications of the experiment and suggestions for further research conclude the dissertation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We propose a model to measure risk in a prisoner’s dilemma based on Coombs’ (1973) re‐parameterization of the game as an individual risk decision‐making task that chooses between a gamble of cooperation and another gamble of defection. Specifically, we propose an index, r, to represent the risk associated with cooperation relative to defection. In conjunction with Rapoport’s (1967) index of cooperation (K), our formulation of risk allows us to construct games that vary in risk (as indexed by r) while controlling for cooperativeness (as indexed by K). Following utility analysis that models risk seeking as a convex utility function and risk averse as a concave function, we predict that riskseeking people cooperate more in games that the cooperation choice is more risky, whereas risk‐averse people cooperate more in games that the cooperation choice is less risky. In the three studies that we varied game parameters, used different measures of risk orientation and prosocial orientation and used different experimental procedures, we found robust results supporting our predictions. Theoretical analysis of our formulation further suggests that risk and cooperativeness of a prisoner’s dilemma game is not entirely independent. Games that have a higher cooperativeness index are necessarily more risky. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The present research validated the construct and criterion validities of the Cooperative and Competitive Personality Scale (CCPS) in a social dilemma context. The results from three studies supported the notion that cooperativeness and competitiveness are two independent dimensions, challenging the traditional view that they are two ends of a single continuum. First, confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a two-factor structure fit the data significantly better than a one-factor structure. Moreover, cooperativeness and competitiveness were either not significantly correlated (Studies 1 and 3) or only moderately positively correlated (Study 2). Second, cooperativeness and competitiveness were differentially associated with Schwartz's Personal Values. These results further supported the idea that cooperativeness and competitiveness are two distinct constructs. Specifically, the individuals who were highly cooperative emphasized self-transcendent values (i.e., universalism and benevolence) more, whereas the individuals who were highly competitive emphasized self-enhancement values (i.e., power and achievement) more. Finally, the CCPS, which adheres to the trait perspective of personality, was found to be a useful supplement to more prevalent social motive measures (i.e., social value orientation) in predicting cooperative behaviors. Specifically, in Study 2, when social value orientation was controlled for, the CCPS significantly predicted cooperative behaviors in a public goods dilemma (individuals who score higher on cooperativeness scale contributed more to the public goods). In Study 3, when social value orientation was controlled for, the CCPS significantly predicted cooperative behaviors in commons dilemmas (individuals who score higher on cooperativeness scale requested fewer resources from the common resource pool). The practical implications of the CCPS in conflict resolution, as well as in recruitment and selection settings, are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Empathy-induced cooperation, forgiveness, and 'returning good for evil' in the Prisoner’s Dilemma were investigated among Chinese participants. In Study 1, empathy for the partner promoted cooperation in a one-trial Prisoner’s Dilemma and fostered forgiveness after the partner’s defection. In Study 2, when the partner had defected beforehand in a sequential one-trial Prisoner’s Dilemma, empathy manipulation showed no effect on 'returning good for evil,' but empathy fostered forgiveness. Expert-rating empathy from the note communication predicted 'returning good for evil.' Males showed more 'returning good for evil' than females. Gender difference related to the effect of empathy on 'returning good for evil' called for further investigation. The implication to the public personnel management in Chinese organizations was discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Recent work has revealed a new class of 'zero-determinant' (ZD) strategies for iterated, two-player games. ZD strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a linear relationship between her score and her opponent’s score, and thus to achieve an unusual degree of control over both players’ long-term payoffs. Although originally conceived in the context of classical two-player game theory, ZD strategies also have consequences in evolving populations of players. Here, we explore the evolutionary prospects for ZD strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD). Several recent studies have focused on the evolution of 'extortion strategies,' a subset of ZD strategies, and have found them to be unsuccessful in populations. Nevertheless, we identify a different subset of ZD strategies, called 'generous ZD strategies,' that forgive defecting opponents but nonetheless dominate in evolving populations. For all but the smallest population sizes, generous ZD strategies are not only robust to being replaced by other strategies but can selectively replace any noncooperative ZD strategy. Generous strategies can be generalized beyond the space of ZD strategies, and they remain robust to invasion. When evolution occurs on the full set of all IPD strategies, selection disproportionately favors these generous strategies. In some regimes, generous strategies outperform even the most successful of the well-known IPD strategies, including win-stay-lose-shift. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Cooperation in prisoner’s dilemma games can usually be sustained only if the game has an infinite horizon. We analyze to what extent the theoretically crucial distinction of finite versus infinite-horizon games is reflected in the outcomes of a prisoner’s dilemma experiment. We compare three different experimental termination rules in four treatments: a known finite end, an unknown end, and two variants with a random termination rule (with a high and with a low continuation probability, where cooperation can occur in a subgame-perfect equilibrium only with the high probability). We find that the termination rules do not significantly affect average cooperation rates. Specifically, employing a random termination rule does not cause significantly more cooperation compared to a known finite horizon, and the continuation probability does not significantly affect average cooperation rates either. However, the termination rules may influence cooperation over time and end-game behavior. Further, the (expected) length of the game significantly increases cooperation rates. The results suggest that subjects may need at least some learning opportunities (like repetitions of the supergame) before significant backward induction arguments in finitely repeated game have force.

"We suggest an alternating proposals protocol with a confirmation stage as a way of solving a Prisoner’s Dilemma game. We interpret players’ proposals and (no) confirmation of outcomes of the game as a tacit communication device. The protocol leads to unprecedented high levels of cooperation in the laboratory. Assigning the power of confirmation to one of the two players alone, rather than alternating the role of a leader significantly increases the probability of cooperation in the first bargaining period. We interpret pre-agreement strategies as tacit messages on players’ willingness to cooperate and as signals pursuing individualistic objectives like publicizing one’s bargaining abilities or eliciting those of the opponent.

"Based on initial research findings by Williams and Bargh (2008) and Kang, Williams, Clark, Gray and Bargh (2011) on the interaction between interpersonal and physical warmth, theoretical models such as cognitive scaffolding and the importance of evaluations of interpersonal warmth in trust-based decisions, this experiment investigated the effect of temperature priming on 30 pairs of British university students with hot and cold objects on frequency of cooperation in a game of iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Participants were found to cooperate significantly more frequently when primed with hot objects than with cold objects, supporting the assertion that physical warmth sensation positively affects interpersonal trust evaluation. No support was found for the prediction that male-male pairs would cooperate less than female-female pairs. The implications of these findings to evolutionary and developmental theories of interpersonal warmth are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Why so many people make the theoretically irrational decision to cooperate in a one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma game remains a puzzle in game theory. Recent developments in evolutionary psychology suggest that the anomaly may be attributable to evolutionary constraints on the human brain and their interaction with general intelligence. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test three hypotheses: (a) projection of a video image of another experimental subject increases cooperation because the human brain implicitly assumes that their choice is not anonymous; (b) more intelligent individuals are more likely to defect, because they are more likely to comprehend the evolutionarily novel features of the experiment that make defection rational; and (c) the effect of the video projection on cooperation is greater among less intelligent individuals. The experiment clearly supports two of the three hypotheses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Cooperation is an important area of investigation for behavior analysis. The Prisoner’s Dilemma game (PDG) provides a useful scenario for studying cooperation in a behavior analytic paradigm. The PDG can be coupled with the concept of the metacontingency to investigate how various contingency arrangements support and promote cooperation in a group. Players in this experiment participated in a PDG and, in some conditions, were given the ability to fine other players but could not talk. The goal of this experiment was to investigate how players’ ability to fine one another affected the players’ patterns of cooperation, and whether fining itself was affected by the addition of a shared group consequence. The data show that participants cooperated in some conditions, but the fines did not seem to affect players’ rates of cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A growing body of research shows that paranoia is common in the general population. We report three studies that examined the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) as a paradigm for evaluation of non-clinical paranoia. The PDG captures three key qualities that are at the heart of paranoia—it is interpersonal, it concerns threat, and it concerns the perception of others' intentions towards the self. Study 1 (n = 175) found that state paranoia was positively associated with selection of the competitive PDG choice. Study 2 (n = 111) found that this association was significant only when participants believed they were playing the PDG against another person, and not when playing against a computer. This finding underscores the interpersonal nature of paranoia and the concomitant necessity of studying paranoia in interpersonal context. In Study 3 (n = 152), we assessed both trait and state paranoia, and differentiated between distrust- and greed-based competition. Both trait and state paranoia were positively associated with distrust-based competition (but not with greed-based competition). Crucially, we found that the association between trait paranoia and distrust-based competition was fully mediated by state paranoia. The PDG is a promising paradigm for the study of non-clinical paranoia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In spite of having deficits in various areas of social cognition, especially in mindreading, Machiavellian individuals are typically very successful in different tasks, including solving social dilemmas. We assume that a profound examination of neural structures associated with decision-making processes is needed to learn more about Machiavellians’ abilities in exploiting other people. More specifically, we predicted that high-Mach people would show elevated activity in the brain areas involved in reward-seeking, anticipation of risky situations, and inference making. To test this hypothesis, we used an fMRI technique to examine individuals as they played the Trust Game. In accordance with our predictions, we found consistent activation in high-Machs’ thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex (player 1), and dorsal anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus (player 2). We suggest that Machiavellians conduct specific neural operations in social dilemma situations that make them successful in exploiting others. Machiavellians may have cognitive heuristics that enable them to make predictions about the future reward in a basically risky and unpredictable situation.

"We examined how group performance (success or failure) and intragroup interactions (minimal or favorable) affected responses to a social dilemma. We predicted that group failure would result in less overall cooperation, but that favorable intragroup interactions would buffer this adverse consequence. We further predicted that this buffering effect would be mediated by group identity, which would, in turn, operate through two processes, normative expectations and goal transformation. We experimentally manipulated the extent to which groups (N = 80 four-person groups) experienced minimal or favorable intragroup interactions and succeeded or failed on an intellective task before facing, as isolated individuals, a social dilemma. Our main hypotheses were supported, and structural equation modeling and analyses of moderated mediation were largely consistent with our theoretical model. The results support a social identity approach to social dilemmas and shed light on the processes involved in intragroup cooperation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Prior research has yielded mixed findings regarding the relation of ostracism to prosocial behavior, with studies indicating ostracism leads people to become less prosocial, more prosocial, or that prosocial behavior is unaffected by workplace ostracism. By conceptualizing prosocial behavior at work as a social dilemma, we hypothesized that whether or not individuals reduce prosocial behaviors following ostracism can be understood by how individuals manage the conflict between the immediate temptation to treat others poorly and the long-term benefits of not giving into such temptations. Across three studies—a scenario (Study 1), experimental (Study 2), and field study on employed adults (Study 3)—we find support for the hypothesis that individuals who are less (versus more) oriented towards future outcomes engage in less prosocial behaviors with others who have ostracized them during prior interactions. We discuss both the practical and theoretical implications of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"According to sexual selection theory and costly signaling theory, men benefit from signaling costly mate qualities to attractive women. To date, several studies have investigated whether men use conspicuous altruism to attract women, but the findings are mixed. This study investigated whether men being observed by an attractive woman engage in competitive economic altruism in three social dilemma games—the Dictator Game, Trust Game (2nd mover), and Public Goods Game—in comparison to men being observed by a non-attractive woman. Results showed that altruistic contributions in the games were not significantly larger in the attractive observer group than in the non-attractive observer group. Exploratory analyses did reveal, however, that amongst participants with an attractive observer only, dispositional generosity had a strongly positive effect on altruism while dispositional dominance had a negative effect on altruism. Moderating effects of key individual differences suggest that the mixed findings within the empirical literature may be attributed to the existence of multiple male courtship signaling strategies. As such, the findings suggest a promising way for future studies to identify different signaling strategies, but until the findings can be replicated with specific hypothesis-driven studies they should be considered with caution.

"Individuals with Asperger’s Disorder (ASP) have difficulties in social reciprocity and in providing appropriate cooperative behavior. The Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) is a well-known model in game theory that illustrates the paradoxical disposition of interaction between two individuals with opposing interests, and may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ASP in early childhood. In this study, we investigated the cognitive characteristics of ASP by using a modified PD game. The subjects were 29 individuals with ASP and 28 age- and IQ-matched controls. In the PD game, each of two players has two cards: card 1 represents cooperation and card 2 betrayal. The score each player obtains is decided according to a 2 x 2 payoff matrix and depends on the combination of their selections. The P-score ('P' for punishment) is defined as the score that is given when they both select betrayal. Comparing the two groups, the mean P-score at the end of the game and the mean total score were significantly higher in the ASP group, while the rate of selection of cooperative choice in both groups did not differ significantly. The classification of the shape of the graph according to fluctuation of the P-score revealed that in the ASP group only 2 cases (6.9%) showed continuous decrease of P-score compared to 8 control cases (28.6%) demonstrating similar results. However, the reasons were thought to be different: ASP subjects presumably selected card 2 because of a preference for the number itself, whereas control subjects preferentially chose this card to enhance their chance of winning the competition. It is often difficult to diagnose ASP in the young especially when they lack the distinctive clinical features of ASD in early childhood. Given the limited number of objective tools to evaluate the cognitive characteristics of ASP subjects, the PD game might be a useful diagnostic support tool for ASP.

"It is not fully understood why we cooperate with strangers on a daily basis. In an increasingly global world, where interaction networks and relationships between individuals are becoming more complex, different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the foundations of human cooperation on a large scale and to account for the true motivations that are behind this phenomenon. In this context, population structure has been suggested to foster cooperation in social dilemmas, but theoretical studies of this mechanism have yielded contradictory results so far; additionally, the issue lacks a proper experimental test in large systems. We have performed the largest experiments to date with humans playing a spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma on a lattice and a scale-free network (1,229 subjects). We observed that the level of cooperation reached in both networks is the same, comparable with the level of cooperation of smaller networks or unstructured populations. We have also found that subjects respond to the cooperation that they observe in a reciprocal manner, being more likely to cooperate if, in the previous round, many of their neighbors and themselves did so, which implies that humans do not consider neighbors’ payoffs when making their decisions in this dilemma but only their actions. Our results, which are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions based on this behavioral rule, suggest that population structure has little relevance as a cooperation promoter or inhibitor among humans.

"One hundred and sixteen students from an Italian university took part in a two-person social dilemma game with a European bogus partner. The main aim of the research was to test the effect that an individual’s level of European social identification has on his/her cooperative behavior with a partner from another European nation. An additional aim was to explore the different effects of the cognitive and affective dimensions of European social identity. Our research also meant to test the role of trust, which for our purposes is defined here as participants’ positive expectation about the cooperative behavior of their European partner. Our results showed that the cognitive dimension of European social identity has a significant direct effect on cooperation, while the affective dimension has an indirect effect mediated by trust. We concluded by discussing the results in relation to different theoretical models, and explored several practical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Dating violence that occurs in young college-aged couples is unique when compared to other types of violence. Aggression occurring in these couples is often bidirectional, highly impacted by situational stressors, and perpetrated by both males and females at relatively equal rates. Most importantly, dating aggression occurs within a developmental context when individuals are attempting to balance autonomy and intimacy within their relationships. However, little is known about conflict management within dating couples or if conflict management processes differ substantially for aggressive and nonaggressive dating couples. Although there has been extensive research in marital processes in conflict, only recently have researchers argued the need for conflict management of young, dating couples to be studied in a dynamic way (Capaldi, Kim, & Shortt, 2007). For this study, a computer administered version of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game was used as a tool for elicitation and observation of conflict behavior of young, dating couples. Specific in-game responding including negative escalation (termed defection spirals), cooperation, and repair were examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition to the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, participants completed questionnaires regarding personal history, current mood, and information on their dating relationship. A cross-sectional sample of college couples (N = 40 couples) was used and group membership (either aggressive or non-aggressive) was determined by endorsement of items on the Revised Conflict Tactic Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman, 1996). Findings suggest aggressive and non-aggressive couples’ perceptions and approach to the Prisoner’s Dilemma game differed significantly. Primary hypotheses regarding differences between groups on the use of defection, cooperation, and repair over time (Group x Time interactions) were not supported by the data. However, aggressive and non-aggressive couples differed significantly on their use of defection and cooperation responses. For example, aggressive couples used more defection responses throughout the Prisoner’s Dilemma game while non-aggressive couples used more cooperative responses. Descriptive analysis of game patterns by group indicated differing patterns for aggressive and non-aggressive couples. In addition, exploratory hypotheses examining the relationship between the Prisoner’s Dilemma game and aggressiveness towards one’s partner were significant, thus, adding to the literature in this area. Implications of these findings and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Recent research has shown that variation in the gene encoding for the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) contributes to individual differences in social-cognitive and emotional functioning in both clinical and non-clinical populations. OXTR has been associated with prosocial behavior, positive and negative emotionality, empathy, maternal sensitivity, and stress reactivity. To date, no study has investigated OXTR in the context of behavioral and emotional reactions to betrayals in trust. The present study examined how variation in 10 SNPs on OXTR may contribute to individual differences in behavior, emotional reactions, and perceptions following a betrayal in trust in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. Following correction for multiple testing, one SNP (rs237887) and two haplotypes (A-rs237887, C-rs2268490; G-rs237887, C-rs2268490) were significantly associated with positive emotional reactions to betrayal. In addition, one haplotype (C-rs9840864, T-rs2268490) was significantly associated with negative emotional reactions to betrayal.

"Recent decades have seen increased interest on the role of emotional expression in human-computer interaction. However, despite a growing number of empirical findings reported in the literature, the results are still inconclusive about the mechanism for the social effects of emotion. This dissertation studies how emotion displays in computers impact people's decision-making and proposes a mechanism for such effects based on appraisal theories of emotion. In appraisal theories, emotion displays arise from cognitive appraisal of events with respect to one's goals (e.g., is this event congruent with my goals? Who is responsible for this event?). According to the pattern of appraisals that occurs, different emotions are experienced and displayed. Since displays reflect the agent's intentions through the appraisal process, we argue people infer, from emotion displays, how computer agents are appraising the ongoing interaction and, from this information, make inferences about the agents' intentions. We refer to this theory as reverse appraisal. To support it, several empirical studies are presented where participants engage in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with virtual agents that, though following the same strategy to choose their actions, display emotions in the face that are consistent with either cooperative or competitive goals. The results confirm that emotion displays impact people's decision making and people cooperate more with cooperative agents. Consistent with reverse appraisal's prediction that what is critical for the effects is not the emotion but the underlying appraisals, the results also show that the same display (e.g., a smile) can lead to opposite effects on cooperation depending on the context in which it is shown. A final study shows that people can successfully retrieve, from emotion displays, information about how agents are appraising the ongoing interaction; moreover, these perceptions of appraisal are shown to mediate the effect of emotion displays on perceptions of the agents' likelihood of cooperation. Having established the theoretical foundations of reverse appraisal, the dissertation presents several computational models of decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma. These models were developed by applying statistical and machine learning techniques on the data collected in the studies. Experimental results show that, as expected, computer models can better replicate human behavior in the original studies if they take into consideration the counterpart's appraisals and emotion displays. In addition, the dissertation also contributes a platform for creating realistic embodied agents that can display emotion. This platform was used in all studies to implement the experimental manipulations and can be used as a research tool to study human-agent and human-human interaction. Finally, the dissertation discusses the implications of reverse appraisal and the reported social effects of emotion for human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, decision and emotion theory.

"In two experiments with the PDG we manipulated the Campbell (1958), or Wertheimer (1923), indices of entitativity (common fate, proximity, and similarity) to examine when a set of individuals interacts with another set of individuals in the competitive manner that is characteristic of group-on-group interactions. Experiment 1 found that interactions between two 3-person sets were more competitive when participants within each set shared (vs. did not share) common fate. In Experiment 2, the Wertheimer–Campbell indices were manipulated for one 3-person set only (targets). Participants in the other 3-person set were sequestered in separate rooms (observers). Observers as well as targets were more competitive when targets shared (vs. did not share) common fate. Path analyses in both experiments supported the idea that common fate increases competition via increased own-set entitativity and subsequent greed, and via increased other-set entitativity and subsequent fear. We found no consistent evidence for the possible roles of proximity and similarity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Iterated games are a fundamental component of economic and evolutionary game theory. They describe situations where two players interact repeatedly and have the ability to use conditional strategies that depend on the outcome of previous interactions, thus allowing for reciprocation. Recently, a new class of strategies has been proposed, so-called 'zero-determinant' strategies. These strategies enforce a fixed linear relationship between one’s own payoff and that of the other player. A subset of those strategies allows 'extortioners' to ensure that any increase in one player’s own payoff exceeds that of the other player by a fixed percentage. Here, we analyze the evolutionary performance of this new class of strategies. We show that in reasonably large populations, they can act as catalysts for the evolution of cooperation, similar to tit-for-tat, but that they are not the stable outcome of natural selection. In very small populations, however, extortioners hold their ground. Extortion strategies do particularly well in coevolutionary arms races between two distinct populations. Significantly, they benefit the population that evolves at the slower rate, an example of the so-called 'Red King' effect. This may affect the evolution of interactions between host species and their endosymbionts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The purpose of this chapter is not to comprehensively review the social dilemma literature, an unfeasible task given the vastness of the field.

This sampling of cutting edge work is admittedly selective and idiosyncratic. Moreover, we will not really know for decades which of the frontiers now being explored will actually yield the most useful scientific knowledge. So perhaps it is more accurate to say that the chapter will focus on four broad topics that strike this observer as exciting—1) fuzzy social dilemmas, 2) sanctioning systems, 3) selective play environments and partner choice, and 4) subtle determinants of dilemma perception and behavior. Some other cutting-edge topics that could have as easily been featured in the chapter (and probably would have been, with a different author) will be noted at the end of the chapter.

"Applying regulatory focus theory to the context of social dilemma situations, the present research demonstrates that individual differences in vigilant, prevention-focused self-regulation predict the tendency to invest private resources to punish uncooperative interaction partners (costly punishment), a behaviour that typically has strong positive effects on the collective level of cooperation. Analyses further support the distinctiveness of the vigilance system proposed in regulatory focus theory (prevention focus) in comparison with general defensive inhibitory tendencies (measured with Carver and White’s Behavioral Inhibition System scale). Results document that individual differences in prevention-focused self-regulation but not differences in general defensive inhibitory tendencies are positively related to costly punishment. In sum, the findings indicate that vigilant, prevention-focused self-regulation plays a crucial role in the context of sanctions that enforce cooperation.

"The present research shows that, like financial sanctions, social punishment (the mere expression of disapproval with another person's conduct) induces compliance with norms for cooperation in a social dilemma. More importantly, after removing the sanctioning opportunity levels of cooperation decrease more under former financial than under former social sanctioning systems. Hence social sanctions are more effective than financial sanctions at inducing 'sticky' norms that guide behavior even in the absence of punishment cues. Public policy implications are discussed.

"When group interests clash with individual ones, maintaining cooperation poses a problem. However, cooperation can be facilitated by introducing reputational incentives. Through indirect reciprocity, people who cooperate in a social dilemma are more likely to receive cooperative acts from others. Another mechanism that enhances group cooperation is reputation-based partner choice, or competitive altruism. According to this framework, cooperators benefit via increased access to cooperative partners. Our study compared the effectiveness of indirect reciprocity and competitive altruism in re-establishing cooperation after the typical decline found during repeated public goods games. Twenty groups of four participants first played a series of public goods games, which confirmed the expected decline. Subsequently, public goods games were alternated with either indirect reciprocity games (in which participants had an opportunity to give to another individual from whom they would never receive a direct return) or competitive altruism games (in which they could choose partners for directly reciprocal interactions). We found that public goods game contributions increased when interspersed with competitive altruism games; they were also higher than in public goods games interspersed with indirect reciprocity games. Investing in reputation by increasing contributions to public goods was a profitable strategy in that it increased returns in subsequent competitive altruism and indirect reciprocity games. There was also some evidence that these returns were greater under competitive altruism than indirect reciprocity. Our findings indicate that strategic reputation building through competitive altruism provides an effective alternative to indirect reciprocity as a means for restoring cooperation in social dilemmas.

The authors investigated whether imagining a group discussion may represent an effective means of increasing cooperative behavior in the absence of the opportunity for direct negotiation among decision makers. Five experiments, utilizing a range of task variants, tested this hypothesis. Participants engaged in a guided simulation of the progressive steps required to reach a cooperative consensus within a group discussion of a social dilemma. Results support the conclusion that imagined group discussion enables conscious processes that parallel those underlying the direct group discussion and is a strategy that can effectively elicit cooperative behavior. The applied potential of imagined group discussion techniques to encourage more socially responsible behavior is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Three computer-controlled experiments were conducted to study interactions between individuals and non-cooperative groups in prototypical social-dilemma games. The asymmetric competition between an individual and a group was compared with symmetric control conditions where both competitors were either individuals or groups. All games were played repeatedly with the same players interacting for 120 rounds. The results show that the outcome of the conflict depends both on the type of competing players and on the structure of the competition. Generally, individuals do better than non-cooperative groups, regardless of the type of conflict, and more often than not it is better to have a non-cooperative group rather than an individual as an opponent. The relative advantage is a result of individuals generally cooperating better with other individuals (as compared to cooperation between two groups), and that in mixed competitions the individual takes advantage of the group’s difficulties in mobilizing collective-action, and dominates it.

"As the world's resources face increasing pressure from a growing population, it is critical that psychologists understand the motivational processes that lead to cooperation or defection in the context of social dilemmas. Research has uncovered several key strategies for encouraging maintenance of these resources, however, one area that remains understudied is the effect various emotions may have on cooperation. Furthermore, it is important to consider the specific type of desired behavior: reduction of consumption of a shared resource, or increased contribution to a shared resource. The current study takes a step in this direction, examining the effects of two self-conscious emotions, guilt and pride, on behavior in two different kinds of social dilemmas. Guilt, a prosocial emotion that has been described as a 'behavioral interrupt mechanism,' is predicted to increase cooperation in both a social trap game and a public goods dilemma game. However, its effects should be strongest in the social trap game, in which the desired behavior is reduced consumption. Pride, an emotion that is conceptually related to the constructs of status and power, is predicted to motivate action in both domains, by increasing both consumption in the social trap game and contribution in the public goods dilemma game. Results partially support these predictions: Whereas guilt and pride both had the predicted effects on consumption in the social trap game, neither had a significant effect on contribution in the public goods dilemma game. Individual differences are examined, as are the results of a Game Feedback Sheet, which yielded insight as to how participants understood the rules of the games, and why they chose the strategies they did. Results support the idea that emotions represent a potentially fruitful avenue of research in social dilemma cooperation, and possible future directions for this research are discussed.

"In public goods games, group members share the benefits created through individual investments. If benefits are shared equally, individual contributions readily become altruistic, and hence, a social dilemma arises in which group interests and individual interests oppose each other. However, contributions to public goods can be self‐serving if each investor gains a disproportionate benefit from its own contribution. This scenario may hold for our study system, the interactions of shoaling‐unrelated scalefin anthias Pseudanthias squamipinnis and the ectoparasitic blenny Plagiotremus tapeinosoma. The blenny bites off pieces of skin, mucus and scales from anthias that in return may chase the blenny. Chasing the blenny represents a public good as it makes the parasite change victim species for its next attack. Laboratory experiments using artificial Plexiglas hosts suggest that one reason why individuals contribute to the public good is that the blenny may specialise on non‐punishing ‘free‐riders’. Here, we investigated how far a spatial structure within the shoal and limited space use by the blenny may contribute to punishment being self‐serving. Field observation reveals that anthias indeed live in spatially structured groups and that blennies have preferred areas for attacks. Thus, some anthias individuals are consistently more exposed to blennies than others and hence may gain disproportional benefits from their punishment. In conclusion, spatial structure may contribute to the maintenance of punishment in blenny–anthias interactions even when groups are large.

"The current study examined the influence of giving competitive, cooperative, and individualistic goals on goal involvement. After being given cooperative, competitive, or individualistic goals, college students (N = 198; 65 male, 133 female) played a social dilemma task and completed questions assessing task, ego, and cooperative goal involvement. Experimental grouping significantly predicted goal involvement, with cooperative group participants defining success by working with partners more often and outperforming others less often than competitive group participants did. As social ways of defining success generally predict beneficial motivation-related outcomes (e.g., Hodge, Allen, & Smellie, 2008; Stuntz & Weiss, 2009), promoting cooperative goals appears beneficial.

"Contributions in the public goods game—a classical social dilemma situation—have been shown to depend strongly on the presence versus absence of punishment or sanctions for free riders. Also, there appear to be noteworthy individual differences in the degree to which decision makers cooperate. Herein, we aimed to bring these two lines of research together. Firstly, we predicted that both presence of punishment and high dispositional Honesty–Humility (as conceptualized in the Honesty–Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to experience model of personality) should yield higher contributions. Secondly, and more importantly, we expected an interaction, such that only those low in Honesty–Humility would condition their behaviour on the presence versus absence of punishment, thus employing cooperation strategically. In line with the hypothesis, the results of two experiments (one of which comprised a longitudinal design) corroborated that the degree to which decision makers shift towards higher contributions when punishment is introduced depends on their dispositional level of Honesty–Humility.

"An experimental study investigated the role of sanctioning systems in shaping individual contributions in step-level public good dilemmas. It was predicted and found that procedural justice of the sanctioning system (i.e., accurate vs. inaccurate evaluations of contributions) influenced contributions. Specifically, when group members identified strongly with the group, procedural justice exerted influence only when the group failed in establishing the public good. In contrast, when group members did not identify strongly with the group, procedural justice of the sanction only exerted influence if the group succeeded. These findings suggest that integrating the social dilemma and procedural justice literature may be beneficial for understanding the conditions that determine the effectiveness of sanctioning systems.

"Chronemic research explores the involvement of time-related messages in communication, and has shown that time is an important component of the message in both traditional and online communication. Social information processing (SIP) theory posits that online communicators exchange social information through chronemic cues. This study points to a gap in SIP theory research, and proceeds to close the gap by demonstrating that changes in socially important attributes are reflected in measurable chronemic changes. A two-person social dilemma online game is used to demonstrate that changes in a simple chronemic variable, interpost pause, reflect differences in the players’ personality (level of extraversion), as well as differences in trust within the dyad. These findings support SIP theory by showing how online chronemics provide cues to important personal and situational information. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We investigate behaviors in organizational and financial economics by utilizing and developing the latest techniques from game theory, experimental economics, computational testbed, and decision-making under risk and uncertainty. In the first chapter, we use game theory and experimental economics approaches to analyze the relationships between corporate culture and the persistent performance differences among seemingly similar enterprises. First, we show that competition leads to higher minimum effort levels in the minimum effort coordination game. Furthermore, we show that organizations with better coordination also lead to higher rates of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game. This supports the theory that the high-efficiency culture developed in coordination games act as a focal point for the outcome of subsequent prisoner's dilemma game. In turn, we argue that these endogenous features of culture developed from coordination and cooperation can help explain the persistent performance differences. In the second chapter, using a computational testbed, we theoretically predict and experimentally show that in the minimum effort coordination game, as the cost of effort increases: (1) the game converges to lower effort levels, (2) convergence speed increases, and (3) average payoff is not monotonically decreasing. In fact, the average profit is an U-shaped curve as a function of cost. Therefore, contrary to the intuition, one can obtain a higher average profit by increasing the cost of effort. In the last chapter, we investigate a well-known paradox in finance. The equity market home bias occurs when the investors over-invest in their home country assets. The equity market home bias is a paradox because the investors are not hedging their risk optimally. Even with unrealistic levels of risk aversion, the equity market home bias cannot be explained using the standard mean-variance model. We propose ambiguity aversion to be the behavioral explanation. We design six experiments using real-world assets and derivatives to show the relationship between ambiguity aversion and home bias. We tested for ambiguity aversion by showing that the investor's subjective probability is sub-additive. The result from the experiment provides support for the assertion that ambiguity aversion is related to the equity market home bias paradox.

"Mimicking real world situations, the Chicken Game allows scientists to examine human decision-making when the outcome is not entirely within one person’s control. In this social dilemma task, two players independently choose either to safely cooperate with, or riskily aggress against, the other player, and the unique combination of their choices specifies the outcome for each. Coupling the Chicken Game with psychophysiological measures, we confirmed our two hypotheses: that an individual perceives an outcome as most negative when she chooses to cooperate and the other player violates that trust and aggresses, and that motivational salience of an outcome is greater when an individual chooses to aggress and when she gains money. Collectively, the data demonstrate the utility of pairing true social dilemma tasks like the Chicken Game with psychophysiological measures to better understand decision-making.

"Advice is increasingly sought and shared online, but advisory professionals debate the utility of such methods. Variations in recipients' perceptions of elements of traditional face-to-face (FTF) advice and Internet-mediated (IM) advice may influence its utilization. The present research investigated whether communication format (FTF vs. IM) and an advisor's level of expertise influence perceptions and utilization of advice. Participants played 30 rounds of a prisoner's dilemma game after receiving advice about the best strategy. There was a significant tendency for advice to be followed, but the advice format and advisor expertise had no significant influence on advice utilization and only minor influences on self-reported perceptions of the advice and the advisor. This has worrying implications, and could indicate a lack of critical awareness of advisors' expertise when deciding whether to follow advice or not. Implications for the professional advice field and further research possibilities are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Playing With Conflict is a weekend course for graduate students in Portland State University’s Conflict Resolution program and undergraduates in all majors. Students participate in simulations, games, and experiential exercises to learn and practice conflict resolution skills. Graduate students create a guided role-play of a conflict. In addition to an oral debriefing, students wrote a debriefing report following the Description, Interpretation, Evaluation (DIE) model of debriefing. The written debriefing report gave all students an opportunity to reflect, analyze, and evaluate their experience in depth. The use of two facilitators allows one to facilitate while the other observes and rests, makes 2 points of view available for the debriefing, and offers a model for resolving minor disagreements between them. Trust among students increased across the weekend as evidenced by an increase in cooperative choices and estimates of the likelihood that others would cooperate in the TAKE-A-CHANCE game, a version of PRISONER’S DILEMMA. Most reported having fun while they learned about themselves, interpersonal conflict, and some large-scale social conflicts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Trust is theorized to be essential for close relationship functioning, and close friendships hold special promise for improving intergroup relations. This dissertation examines how trust (not mere liking) is attained, maintained, and regained between Black and White individuals as a function of closeness (inclusion of other in the self) in friendship contexts. Trust placed in outgroup (vs. same-race) friends is hypothesized to be shallower, asymmetric, and more vulnerable to disruption. In Study 1, a dyadic investigation over time, White and Black students who described interracial (vs. same-race) friendships initially reported less trust, closeness, stimulating companionship, reliable alliance, self-disclosure, perceived other disclosure, perceived help/support, and perceived understanding, followed by less perceived other disclosure and less contact a year later. Participants' initial trust and closeness (not liking) mediated these effects. Initial trust predicted fewer subsequent friend betrayals and greater closeness to an outgroup friend's racial group one year later. In Studies 2a and 2b, White and Black participants imagined a White or Black friend engaging in relational behaviors over time, sometimes including a betrayal. Black participants reported less cultural trust (not liking) after imagining a betrayal by a White (vs. Black) friend. No cultural trust gap emerged for White participants, or for Black participants who were high in subjective closeness or not betrayed. In Study 3, White and Black strangers completed either control or friendship-inducing closeness tasks in dyads before a prisoner's dilemma game that sometimes simulated a partner defection. After partner defections, Black participants reported lower trust (not liking) for White than Black partners, an effect partially mediated by negative other-directed affect, in the control condition. Black participants in the closeness condition and no-betrayal condition trusted White and Black partners equally, as did White participants. These studies (a) suggest that Black individuals trust ingroup more than outgroup individuals, particularly after betrayals, except when subjective closeness is high, and (b) underscore the centrality of trust (not liking) and closeness for successful interracial friendships.

"Everybody has heard of neighbours who have been fighting over some minor topic for years. The fight goes back and forth, giving the neighbours a hard time. These kind of reciprocal punishments are known as vendettas and they are a cross-cultural phenomenon. In evolutionary biology, punishment is seen as a mechanism for maintaining cooperative behaviour. However, this notion of punishment excludes vendettas. Vendettas pose a special kind of evolutionary problem: they incur high costs on individuals, i.e. costs of punishing and costs of being punished, without any benefits. Theoretically speaking, punishment should be rare in dyadic relationships and vendettas would not evolve under natural selection. In contrast, punishment is assumed to be more efficient in group environments which then can pave the way for vendettas. Accordingly, we found that under the experimental conditions of a prisoner’s dilemma game, human participants punished only rarely and vendettas are scarce. In contrast, we found that participants retaliated frequently in the group environment of a public goods game. They even engaged in cost-intense vendettas (i.e. continuous retaliation), especially when the first punishment was unjustified or ambiguous. Here, punishment was mainly targeted at defectors in the beginning, but provocations led to mushrooming of counter-punishments. Despite the counter-punishing behaviour, participants were able to enhance cooperation levels in the public goods game. Few participants even seemed to anticipate the outbreak of costly vendettas and delayed their punishment to the last possible moment. Overall, our results highlight the importance of different social environments while studying punishment as a cooperation-enhancing mechanism.

"Participants engaged in the Prisoner’s dilemma game with a partner through a computer terminal. We define two types of partner: a perceived partner and an actual partner, and manipulated the two factors independently. A perceived partner means a partner with whom participants imagined themselves to be interacting; instruction given by an experimenter controls the image of the perceived partner. An actual partner can change its behavior. In one scenario participants actually interacted with a human partner, in another scenario their partner was either a mostly cooperating computer agent or a mostly defecting computer agent. Three experiments were performed. The result suggested that the participants’ selection behavior was largely influenced by the instruction given about the partner by the experimenter and not influenced by the partner’s actual behavior. The analysis of the participants’ impressions of the partner showed that the effect of instruction about the partner disappeared. Individual likeability for a partner was very influenced by the partner’s behavior; as the participants incurred more defect actions from the partner, individual likeability for the partner decreased. On the other hand, social likeability for a partner was not so influenced by the partner’s behavior, but rather related to the participants’ own behavior. The participants who made more defect actions rated their partner’s social likeability lower. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"An altruistic rationalization explanation of the interindividual–intergroup discontinuity effect proposes that intergroup interactions are more competitive than interactions between individuals because group membership creates an opportunity to rationalize selfishly motivated competitiveness as being enacted for the ingroup’s sake. To test this explanation, we compared participants whose decisions did not influence the earnings of other participants, and who therefore had no opportunity for altruistic rationalization of competitiveness, with participants whose decisions did influence the earnings of other participants, and who therefore did have an opportunity for altruistic rationalization. Competition in a prisoner’s dilemma game was greater when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present, but this effect was significant only for participants who were low in dispositional proneness to guilt, a trait that motivates prosocial behavior. In other words, we found that dispositionally selfish individuals were most likely to become more competitive when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present. These findings provide evidence for an additional mechanism driving the discontinuity effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We introduce a novel mechanism to eliminate endgame effects in repeated prisoner’s dilemma experiments.

"Previous neuroimaging studies of scenarios such as the prisoner's dilemma and ultimatum game show how brain systems which evolved to process rewarding and aversive stimuli are activated differentially during adherence to and breaches of norms. One theory of how shared social norms evolve is that they arise from mutually rewarding conventions which, through repeated execution, acquire a normative value that sustains social cohesion even when individual self-interest is not served. The authors report an fMRI study of a 2-player coordination game in which players must coordinate on an arbitrary convention (a left or right button press) to obtain monetary rewards. Once this convention has been established, one of the participants is incentivized to deviate from the equilibrium with the offer of extra reward. During the period prior to decisions to violate the convention, activity was observed in regions associated with reward processing, such as the midbrain, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex. Activations in advance of decisions to continue coordinating included the amygdala and anterior insula–inferior frontal gyrus. The data are discussed in the light of theories which propose the existence of multiple interacting value-based decision-making systems in the human brain.

"Increased cooperation in groups that are allowed to communicate (engage in 'cheap talk') has been attributed to reputation-building and to cultural norms or culturally normal behavior. We tested these two theories by exposing groups of undergraduates to a public-goods social dilemma. Five groups were permitted to communicate via anonymous written messages that were read aloud. The groups with messaging contributed substantially more to the common good than the groups without messaging. Because the messages were anonymous, their efficacy cannot be explained by effects on reputation. Instead, the results point to the participants’ histories of giving and receiving exhortations to cooperate—i.e., to culturally normal behavior (cultural norms).

"An experiment examined whether and how the relationship between individual differences in social attachment and cooperation is modulated by brain oxytocin, a neuropeptide implicated both in parent—child bonding, and in social approach. Healthy males completed a validated attachment style measure, received intranasal oxytocin or placebo, and privately chose between cooperation and non-cooperation in an incentivized social dilemma with an anonymous stranger. Attachment anxiety-the tendency to fear rejection by others-had few effects and was not modulated by oxytocin. However, oxytocin interacted with attachment avoidance-the tendency to fear dependency and closeness in interpersonal relations. Especially among participants high rather than low in attachment avoidance, oxytocin reduced betrayal aversion, and increased trust and cooperation compared to placebo. Effects of attachment avoidance and oxytocin on cooperation were mediated by betrayal aversion, and not by affiliation tendencies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Collective action, or the large-scale cooperation in the pursuit of public goods, has been suggested to have evolved through cultural group selection. Previous research suggests that the costly punishment of group members who do not contribute to public goods plays an important role in the resolution of collective action dilemmas. If large-scale cooperation sustained by the punishment of defectors has evolved through the mechanism of cultural group selection, two implications regarding costly punishment follow: (1) that people are more willing to punish defecting group members in a situation of intergroup competition than in a single-group social dilemma game and (2) that levels of 'perverse' punishment of cooperators are not affected by intergroup competition. We find confirmation for these hypotheses. However, we find that the effect of intergroup competition on the punishment of defectors is fully explained by the stronger conditionality of punishment on expected punishment levels in the competition condition.

"In a best-shot public good, where the provision level is determined by the highest contribution instead of the sum of all contributions, there is potential for waste and underprovision due to coordination failure. These failures are exacerbated when agents are identical because there is no focal point to guide coordination. In most real-world best-shot public-good situations, however, heterogeneity exists in the ability to contribute and the benefits received from the good. With such differences, shared expectations might emerge to improve coordination and increase efficiency. Using laboratory experiments, we find significant behavioral responses to heterogeneity that improve efficiency, but not always from increased coordination.

"Although scholars have suggested that emotions are important for social dilemmas, extant research has neither documented, nor directly studied the influence of anger, disgust, or sadness on choices that involve social dilemmas. What is more, research that looks at social dilemmas typically examines public good dilemmas (e.g., giving resources to a group) and resource dilemmas (e.g., taking resources from a group) separately. Rarely are both dilemmas examined simultaneously, a potential oversight considering research on decision-making implicates give-and-take differences. In this paper, we propose that an important part of cooperating in different social dilemmas involves emotionally guided goals, termed emotivations. For example, emotivations include: in anger, wanting to antagonize others; in disgust, wanting to expel objects and avoid taking anything new; and in sadness, wanting to change one’s situation. We suggest that the amount of shared group resources that people give and take is associated with each of these particular emotivations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We study an evolutionary model of a public good game with rewards played on a network. Giving rewards to contributors transforms the game but gives rise to a second-order dilemma. By allowing for coevolution of strategies and network structure, the evolutionary dynamics operate on both structure and strategy. Players learn with whom to interact and how to act and can overcome the second-order dilemma. More specifically, the network represents social distance which changes as players interact. Through the change in social distance, players learn with whom to interact, which we model using reinforcement dynamics. We find that, for certain parameter constellations, a social institution, prescribing prosocial behavior and thus solving the second-order dilemma, can emerge from a population of selfish players. Due to the dynamic structure of the network, the institution has an endogenous punishment mechanism ensuring that defectors will be excluded from the benefits of the institution and the public good will be supplied efficiently.

"Grounded and embodied cognitions have gained increasing interest in explaining the effects of the physical environments on social cognition and behavior. However, the very nature of the processes underlying embodiment is largely unknown. The current research aims at contributing to this issue by (1) differentiating between the embodiment of contents and procedures, (2) unfolding the processes underlying mechanism of an embodied procedure, and (3) showing its boundary conditions. Seven experiments investigated these refinements using the examples of darkness, self-construal, and cooperation in social dilemmas. The results provided consistent evidence that darkness triggers interdependent self-construal, which in turn promotes cooperation. Moreover, the individual's internal context and external context moderated the darkness-cooperation effect. These results contribute to the understanding of embodied and situated social cognition and behavior and provide a consistent explanation for the mixed findings of lighting on cooperation in particular and prosocial behavior in general.

"Cooperative behavior is the subject of intense study in a wide range of scientific fields, yet its evolutionary origins remain largely unexplained. A leading explanation of cooperation is the mechanism of altruistic punishment, where individuals pay to punish others but receive no material benefit in return. Experiments have shown such punishment can induce cooperative outcomes in social dilemmas, though sometimes at the cost of reduced social welfare. However, experiments typically examine the effects of punishing low contributors without allowing others in the environment to respond. Thus, the full ramifications of punishment may not be well understood. Here, I use evolutionary simulations of agents playing a continuous prisoners dilemma to study behavior subsequent to an act of punishment, and how that subsequent behavior affects the efficiency of payoffs. Different network configurations are used to better understand the relative effects of social structure and individual strategies. Results show that when agents can either retaliate against their punisher, or punish those who ignore cheaters, the cooperative effects of punishment are reduced or eliminated. The magnitude of this effect is dependent on the density of the network in which the population is embedded. Overall, results suggest that a better understanding of the aftereffects of punishment is needed to assess the relationship between punishment and cooperative outcomes.

"The emergence of the positive psychology movement has inspired research on positive emotions over the years; yet, several constructs have received limited attention. One of such is gratitude. Research has demonstrated that gratitude leads to prosocial behaviors, such as the engagement in effortful assistance to others, or involving in gift-exchanges in dyadic relationships. However, few studies have directly examined the effects of gratitude on cooperation, particularly, in a social dilemma context. Therefore, the current research aims at investigating the impact of gratitude on cooperative behaviors in a public good game. Traditional methodology in emotion research induces emotions exogenously, i.e. with the use of recall procedures, imagination of scenarios or video clips. Here, a new methodology is introduced where the emotion of gratitude is induced endogenously, within a public good game. Using this new induction procedure, it was found that endogenous gratitude motivated cooperative behaviors. In addition, it was also of interest to investigate the potential influences of contextual factors on the gratitude-cooperation linkage. Studies were systematically conducted to examine three contextual variables, namely; human contact through handshaking, threat of exclusion, and perspective-taking through empathy induction. Results across the four studies suggest that the emotion of gratitude acts as a motivator for cooperative behaviors in the presence of an exclusion option and empathy induction.

"The evolution of cooperation has been the focus of intense research in the social sciences, natural sciences (especially biology), and even computer science. It has long been recognized that the possibility of future consequences is crucial to the emergence of rational cooperation. It was thought that random matching was isomorphic to one-shot play, but Kandori (1992) showed that a reputation labeling mechanism can be used to support cooperation in the random matching Prisoner Dilemma. We designed an experiment to test this result. We found that while the level of cooperation steadily declined without a reputation mechanism, with our color-coded reputation mechanism the level of cooperation steadily increased with experience. An econometric mixture model consisting of four reputation-conditioned strategies as well as a Level-0 type was fitted to the data. We cannot reject the hypothesis that the majority of subjects used one of these strategies and learned with experience. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Many theories of trust emphasize that trust is most relevant to behavior in situations involving a conflict of interests. However, it is not clear how trust relates to behavior across situations that differ in the degree of conflicting interest: Does trust matter more when the conflict of interest is small or large? According to an interdependence perspective, trust becomes an especially important determinant of behavior in situations involving larger, compared to smaller, degrees of conflicting interests. To examine this perspective, we conducted a meta-analysis involving 212 effect sizes on the relation between trust (both state and dispositional trust in others) and cooperation in social dilemmas—situations that involve varying degrees of conflict between self-interest and collective interest. Results revealed that the positive relation between trust and cooperation is stronger when there is a larger, compared to smaller, degree of conflict. We also examined several other possible moderators of the relation between trust and cooperation. The relation between trust and cooperation was stronger during individual, compared to intergroup, interactions but did not vary as a function of the situation being either a one-shot or repeated interaction. We also find differences across countries in the extent that people condition their own cooperation based on their trust in others. We discuss how the results support an emerging consensus about trust being limited to situations of conflict and address some theoretical and societal implications for our understanding of how and why trust is so important to social interactions and relationships.

"Previous work has demonstrated that Social Value Orientation (SVO) is related to cooperative behavior in social dilemmas. However, little is known concerning the underlying processes. In two eye-tracking studies investigating decisions in money allocation tasks (Experiment 1) and Public Good Dilemmas (Experiment 2), we show that differences in SVO are accompanied by consistent differences in information search. Decision time, number of fixations, the proportion of inspected information, the degree of attention towards the others’ payoffs, and the number of transitions from and towards others’ payoffs gradually increase with absolute SVO deviation from a pure selfish orientation. Overall these effects seem to be similar for individuals caring positively (i.e., cooperative) or negatively (i.e., competitive) about others. The fact that changes are gradual instead of abrupt indicates that differences in SVO seem to be related to gradual changes in weights given to outcomes for self and others.

"The present paper focuses on third-parties’ decisions to punish and reward in social dilemmas, and on the moderating role of environmental uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about the size of the common resource). We argue and demonstrate that in social dilemmas third-parties use the equality rule as a strict benchmark to determine punishments (Study 1) as well as rewards (Study 2), but only under environmental certainty. Under environmental uncertainty, third-parties do not apply such a strict benchmark to distinguish cooperators from defectors. Instead, they appear to use the following rule: the more an individual group member has cooperated the less he/she should be punished (Study 1) and the more he/she should be rewarded (Study 2). As such, these findings are the first to demonstrate that third-party sanctioning decisions are moderated by environmental uncertainty. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In an otherwise neutrally described Prisoners’ dilemma experiment, we document that behavior is more likely to be cooperative when the game is called the Community Game than when it is called the Stock Market Game. However, the difference vanishes when only one of the subjects is in control of her action. The social framing effect also vanishes when the game is played sequentially. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the Community label triggers a desire to cooperate, but consistent with the hypothesis that social frames are coordination devices. More generally, our evidence indicates that social frames enter people’s beliefs rather than their preferences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Comments on an article by Joachim I. Krueger, Theresa E. DiDonato & David Freestone (see record [rid]2012-07662-001[/rid]). The social projection theory presented by the authors has a sound computational structure, its underlying reasoning process seems to be unnecessary and result in conflicting choices. In fact, it is the shift from conditioning behavior on the probability of cooperation to conditioning behavior on the probability of similarity that provides a new normative theory and a descriptive model of behavior. Mixing the probability of similarity with the probability of cooperation in the same model seems to annul the progress provided by the former. Of course, one cannot exclude the possibility that under some constraints some individuals will reason sequentially about the single-step PD game, with the player making the first move and the opponent either reciprocating or deviating. One also cannot deny the existence of individuals who are completely ignorant regarding their opponents and therefore make use of their own disposition as a proxy for their opponent's choice. To construct an opponent whose similarity level can be portrayed by a precise probability while excluding any form of reciprocity, participants were placed in front of a mirror that reflected their own image. The present manuscript examined social projection theory by comparing its underlying cognitive process and computational structure with Subjective Expected Relative Similarity.

"How can changes in degrees of group affiliation or identity change one’s decision to cooperate or defect in a dilemma? According to the logic of appropriateness, decision changes result from changes in answer to the question, 'what does a person like me do in a situation like this?' In two studies, transient group affiliation is systematically manipulated to test its influence on the appropriateness question both in the present and future. Novel methodologies (videotaping group interactions to obtain observed levels of group affiliation, implicit measures of social concept activation and aspect listing protocols) were used to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the influence of group affiliation. Increases in group affiliation are accompanied by increases in the accessibility of social constructs, higher levels of cooperation, personal satisfaction and trust in one’s group. Similar patterns are observed for decisions in the present and future. There is an order effect observed with decisions to cooperate in the future carrying over to subsequent decisions to cooperate in the present, but a decision to initially cooperate in the present does not translate as strongly to a decision to cooperate in the future. This is in part because a more analytical approach is used for decisions pertaining to the future, while decisions in the present tend to be more affect-based.

"In today’s increasingly interconnected world, deciding with whom and at what level to cooperate becomes a matter of increasing importance as societies become more globalized and large-scale cooperation becomes a viable means of addressing global issues. This tension can play out via competition between local (e.g. within a group) and global (e.g., between groups) interests. Despite research highlighting factors influencing cooperation in such multi-layered situations, their biological basis is not well understood. In a double-blind placebo controlled study, we investigated the influence of intranasally administered oxytocin and arginine vasopressin on cooperative behavior at local and global levels. We find that oxytocin causes an increase in both the willingness to cooperate and the expectation that others will cooperate at both levels. In contrast, participants receiving vasopressin did not differ from those receiving placebo in their cooperative behavior. Our results highlight the selective role of oxytocin in intergroup cooperative behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The present paper explores the effect of the salience of collective consequences of opportunistic behavior in commons and anticommons dilemmas. Making this type of externalities salient was expected to increase the awareness of the conflict between collective and personal interests, especially in the anticommons dilemma. The results of a vignette study (Study 1, N = 100) and a laboratory experiment (Study 2, N = 55) confirmed our hypotheses, revealing more opportunistic behavior in the anticommons than in the commons dilemma when externalities were not made salient, while no significant dilemma effect was obtained when the externalities were made salient. Moreover, the results of Study 2 demonstrated that the dilemma effect on cooperation was mediated by externalities awareness. The positive effects of increments in externalities awareness on cooperation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Bridging the literatures on social dilemmas, intergroup conflict, and social hierarchy, the authors systematically varied the intergroup context in which social dilemmas were embedded to investigate how costly contributions to public goods influence status conferral. They predicted that contribution behavior would have opposite effects on 2 forms of status—prestige and dominance—depending on its consequences for the self, in-group and out-group members. When the only way to benefit in-group members was by harming out-group members (Study 1), contributions increased prestige and decreased dominance, compared with free-riding. Adding the option of benefitting in-group members without harming out-group members (Study 2) decreased the prestige and increased the dominance of those who chose to benefit in-group members via intergroup competition. Finally, sharing resources with both in-group and out-group members decreased perceptions of both prestige and dominance, compared with sharing them with in-group members only (Study 3). Prestige and dominance differentially mediated the effects of contribution behavior on leader election, exclusion from the group, and choices of a group representative for an intergroup competition. Taken together, these findings show that the well-established relationship between contribution and status is moderated by both the intergroup context and the conceptualization of status.

"There are robust findings in the interteam literature that suggest interteam relationships are more competitive than interpersonal relationships (i.e., group discontinuity effect). Previous studies suggest that allowing intra-team communication increases the team discontinuity effect because having communication among team members strengthens in-group favoritism norms. Drawing on the Information Sampling Theory (Stasser, 1989) and Social Decision Making Theory (Kerr, 2001), I argue that communication among team members sways groups to compete more because members are more likely to focus on sharing more popular opinions to compete than opinions to cooperate. Accordingly, I propose that having team discussion interventions that facilitates a discussion of cooperative opinions will increase team decisions to cooperate. Specifically, I hypothesized that making teams discuss pros and cons of both cooperative and competitive decisions will make teams become more cooperative. In addition, I proposed that having cooperative individuals to speak first during team discussion will increase team decisions to cooperate. Participants played a Prisoner's Dilemma Game for six trials as an individual or a three-person team. In individual conditions, individuals played PDGs individually. In the control team condition, teams played the PDGs and each trial allowed for two minutes of team discussion. In the balanced team condition, teams played PDGs and team members discussed using a decision guideline. In the cooperative primacy condition, the most cooperative team members were given opportunity to speak first during team discussion for two minutes for each trial. Teams competed more than individuals thereby replicating the group discontinuity effect. Consistent with our prediction, teams with balanced team discussion made more cooperative choices than teams in the control condition. Teams with cooperative primacy made the most cooperative choices in the first two trials but their cooperation rates decreased over time. These results suggest that having team discussion interventions can potentially allow teams to make more cooperative choices and decrease the discontinuity effect. Implications and limitations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The purpose of this dissertation is to develop and validate the constructs of self- and other-interest as self-construals, as well as tool for measuring them: the Self- and Other-Interest Inventory (SOII). Four sets of studies are presented to accomplish this task. In Studies 1a-c, three student samples are used to develop and validate the student SOII using existing measures within the psychological literature, in a traditional scale validation collection of studies. In Study 2, the SOII is assessed for its ability to detect situational influence via a priming task in which participants receive either primes of individualistic or collectivistic values as an instantiation of the accessibility of self-construals of self- and other-interest. In Studies 3a-c, the SOII is assessed for its ability to predict behavior: participants' donation behavior is shown to depend on whether self-interest or other-interest self-construal is accessible; perseverance in a mental rotation task is predicted by self-interest self-construal when incentivized by benefits to the self and other-interest self-construal when incentivized by benefits to the other; and cooperative behavior in a prisoner's dilemma depends on both self- and other-interest self-construals when both are made accessible. Finally, in Studies 4a & b, the adult version of the SOII is validated and used to show that participants' age predicts differences in the relationships between self-construals, and the relationship between age and positive relationship between self- and other-interest predicts the development of generativity (as opposed to stagnation), the primary developmental task of midlife.

"The authors propose a new structural solution to the knowledge-sharing dilemma. They show that simple auction mechanisms, which impose a rigid set of rules designed to standardize interactions and communication among participants, can prevent some of the detrimental effects associated with conflict of interest in freely interacting groups. The authors report results of two experiments that show that transparent conflicts of interest lead to a breakdown of information sharing, learning, and knowledge transfer in freely interacting groups, but not in simple markets and auctions. In these settings, participants were able to identify the best candidate in a voting game and to learn the solution to an intellective reasoning task, allowing participants to successfully transfer their insights to a series of new intellective tasks (tackled up to four weeks later), despite the conflicts of interests among traders. The authors explain their findings within the theoretical framework of collective induction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Recent studies have found that activating religious cognition by priming techniques can enhance prosocial behavior, arguably because religious concepts carry prosocial associations. But many of these studies have primed multiple concepts simultaneously related to the sacred. We argue here that religion and God are distinct concepts that activate distinct associations. In particular, we examine the effect of God and religion on prosociality toward the ingroup and outgroup. In three studies, we found that religion primes enhanced prosociality toward ingroup members, consistent with ingroup affiliation, whereas, God primes enhanced prosociality toward outgroup member, consistent with concerns of moral impression management. Implications for theory and methodology in religious cognition are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Although cooperation represents a core facet of human social behavior there exists considerable variability across people in terms of the tendency to cooperate. One factor that may contribute to individual differences in cooperation is a key gene within the oxytocin (OT) system, the OT reception gene (OXTR). In this article, we aim to bridge the gap between the OXTR gene and cooperation by using an endophenotype approach. We present evidence that the association between the OXTR gene and cooperation may in part be due to how the OXTR gene affects brain systems involved in emotion recognition, empathy/theory of mind, social communication and social reward seeking. There is evidence that the OXTR gene is associated with the functional anatomy of the amygdala, visual cortex (VC), anterior cingulate and superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, it is currently unknown how the OXTR gene may be linked to the functional anatomy of other relevant brain regions that include the fusiform gyrus (FG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We conclude by highlighting potential future research directions that may elucidate the path between OXTR and complex behaviors such as cooperation.

"In the current research we tested a comprehensive model of spirituality, religiosity, compassion, and altruism, investigating the independent effects of spirituality and religiosity on compassion and altruism. We hypothesized that, even though spirituality and religiosity are closely related, spirituality and religiosity would have different and unique associations with compassion and altruism. In Study 1 and 2 we documented that more spiritual individuals experience and show greater compassion. The link between religiosity and compassion was no longer significant after controlling for the impact of spirituality. Compassion has the capacity to motivate people to transcend selfish motives and act altruistically toward strangers. Therefore, we reasoned that spirituality (but not religiosity) would predict altruistic behavior and that compassion would help explain this link. Indeed, in Studies 3, 4, and 5 we found that more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically in economic choice and decision-making tasks, and that the tendency of spiritual individuals to feel greater compassion mediated the spirituality-to-altruism relationship. In contrast, more religious participants did not consistently feel more compassion nor behave more altruistically. Moreover, in Studies 3 and 4 we found that the broader traits of Agreeableness, Openness, and Extraversion did not help explain why more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically. Our findings argue that spirituality—above and beyond religiosity—is uniquely associated with greater compassion and enhanced altruism toward strangers.

"Examined interindividual–intergroup discontinuity in the context of 3 different generalizations of the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG). Exp 1 (involving 125 undergraduates) used a multi-prisoner's dilemma (MPD) game to compare interaction between 3 individuals with interaction between 3 groups. Results revealed just as much discontinuity between three players (MPD) as between 2 players (PDG). Exp 2 (involving 266 undergraduates) used the approach of n-person games to examine 2 further generalizations from the PDG. One generalization involved the intergroup public goods game, and the other the intergroup prisoner's dilemma game. With both games, it was found that groups were more competitive than individuals.

"The 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game can differ with respect to positive and negative outcomes, whether games are played simultaneously or sequentially, and whether one or the other person is allowed to play the sequential game first. The observed strategies of 52 participants playing these games in a computer experiment were explained by the values of the payoffs, the expectations regarding the other person's moves, and by personal information. It appears that a subjective expected utility model can be used to test different psychological models of choice. A model assuming segregated evaluation of the payoffs in the sequential games gave a better explanation of the choices than a model assuming integration of payoffs.

"Used a prisoner's dilemma (PD) game to examine how decision tasks in advertising-budget setting are affected by information about the competitive situation and by characteristics of the decision maker. 57 business students were responsible for setting the advertising budgets for 4 product brands with either short- or long-term profit objectives. Ss were generally competitive, choosing a dominant high advertising budget a majority of the time, and expected their opponents to be competitive as well, but less so. Ss' strategy choices were also affected by what their opponent did last time, whether the competitive relationship was expected to continue, relative market shares, and whether profit objectives were short- or long-term. Individual characteristics affected decision making, with empathy, integrity, risk attitude, age, and gender contributing to strategy choice. Ss often did not adhere to the normative recommendations of the basic PD game. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Attempts to improve potential for comparing findings by proposing variables that specify incentive features of collective action designs. For many designs as seemingly disparate as those in prisoner's dilemma, commons dilemma, and public goods provision games, these specifications should enable different designs to be represented as values along common incentive parameters. With this procedure, the influence of incentives can be assessed and controlled across disparate experimental designs as well as the cumulative influence of other variables (for example, group size and identity, framing, and socioeconomic characteristics of Ss) that provoke collective action behavior.

"Outlines a model of how freedom to choose between playing and not playing particular Prisoner's Dilemma games can increase social welfare and provide relative gains to intending cooperators. When cooperators are relatively more willing to play, they will interact more frequently with each other and their payoff per encounter will be potentially higher than that of intending defectors. Because the cooperate–cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optional entry will increase social welfare. Laboratory data from 6 adults illustrate that social welfare and the relative welfare of intending cooperators are higher when Ss are free to choose between entering and not entering particular Prisoner's Dilemma relationships and that this difference is due to intending cooperators' greater willingness to enter such relationships, rather than to any capacity to recognize and avoid intending defectors.

Results show strong effects for culture with higher cooperation among South Vietnamese than among Americans. Using the same Ss from Study 1, Study 2 investigated the resiliency of this difference using a 2 person prisoner's dilemma game. Results from Study 2 supported those from Study 1 with Vietnamese showing a less severe decline in cooperation over time than Americans.

Repeated interaction, resulting in the possibility of conditional cooperation and the possibility of learning in intergroup conflict, was studied in the context of 2 team games: the intergroup public goods (IPG) game and the intergroup prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game.

"Used a prisoner's dilemma paradigm to study trust and trusting behavior in 2 experiments with 18 6-person groups. Females as a category were more trusted to cooperate, by both male and female judges, than were males. Yet neither male nor female judges used gender to predict cooperation from particular individuals (trust) or as a criterion for choosing to play (trusting behavior) when they had the option of not playing. Further, females and males did not differ in their cooperation rates. It is speculated that (1) Ss' generalized expectations are a response to gender-based role differences outside the laboratory, (2) Ss' failure to make individual-by-individual discriminations by gender is a response to the fact that the experimental context made such natural-world roles irrelevant, and (3) findings about the irrelevance of gender per se in trusting relationships will be true for other social categories per se.

"The well-known Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to model situations of social conflict between 2 or more actors. The essence of the dilemmas is that each actor has individual incentives to act according to narrow self-interests referred to as defection, yet all actors are better off and receive higher payoffs for mutual cooperation. Many attempts have been made to study ways by which cooperation can be enhanced. This article focuses on a specific device, namely hostage posting or pledging of a bond. In the 1st part, a game-theoretic model is sketched that specifies the conditions under which hostage posting will effectively promote cooperative behavior. In the 2nd part, the authors describe several experiments that were designed to test the descriptive power of the theory, and at the same time they provide further insight into the processes underlying social conflicts. Implications regarding social conflicts and possible applications to other domains are briefly discussed in the end. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Students with high reciprocation wariness, a general fear of exploitation in interpersonal relationships, showed (1) a markedly reduced positive response to cooperative communication in a Prisoner's Dilemma bargaining task, (2) a greater negative response to uncooperative communication, and (3) an increased positive response to the prospect of long-term interaction. Friends and roommates of high-wary students evaluated them as unsympathetic, inconsiderate, and manipulative. Students who were supervised by high-wary dormitory resident assistants evaluated them as unapproachable, hesitant to develop close relationships, and unresponsive to student needs. Wariness was found to be unrelated to social goal orientation and Machiavellianism. Reciprocation wariness appears to inhibit the establishment and strengthening of interpersonal relationships.

"Explored nonconsequential behavior in several reasoning and decision-making tasks. The authors posit that when thinking under uncertainty, people often do not consider appropriately each of the relevant branches of a decision tree, as required by consequentialism. As a result they sometimes violate L. J. Savage's (1954) sure-thing principle. In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, for example, many Ss compete when they know that the opponent has competed and when they know that the opponent has cooperated, but cooperate when they do not know the opponent's response. Newcomb's Problem and R. Nozick (1969) and P. C. Wason's (1966) selection task are also interpreted as manifestations of nonconsequential decision making and reasoning.

Dyads including at least 1 constituent representative bargained more cooperatively and achieved better outcomes than did nonrepresentative dyads.

"The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) is a central paradigm in the study of animal cooperation. According to the IPD framework, repeated play (repetition) and reciprocity combine to maintain a cooperative equilibrium. However, experimental studies with animals suggest that cooperative behavior in IPDs is unstable, and some have suggested that strong preferences for immediate benefits (that is, temporal discounting) might explain the fragility of cooperative equilbria. The authors studied the effects of discounting and strategic reciprocity on cooperation in 16 captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata). The results demonstrate an interaction between discounting and reciprocity. Blue jays show high stable levels of cooperation in treatments with reduced discounting when their opponent reciprocates, but their levels of cooperation decline in all other treatment combinations. This suggests that stable cooperation requires both reduced discounting and reciprocity, and it offers and explanation of earlier failures to find cooperation in controlled payoff games.

"In the two-person prisoner's dilemma game, there is considerable evidence that the tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy is most effective in inducing the other person to cooperate. One of the important features of the TFT strategy is that it cooperates on the first trial. We varied the initial choices of a simulated other, and tested the effects of initial choices (cooperation or defection), and persistence of initial choices: unilateral cooperation (or defection) on the first trial, first two trials, or first four trials. Results showed that a cooperative strategy--one that starts with cooperative choices--induced greater cooperation than a strategy that started with defections. The results of this study clearly show that a cooperative strategy--one that initiates unilateral cooperation at the outset and then adopts a TFT strategy--is very effective in inducing subsequent cooperation from the other party, the effectiveness of a cooperative strategy varies directly with the cooperative orientation of the other party (a cooperative strategy is more effective against a cooperative than a competitive person), and initial cooperation is more effective if it is repeated more than once.

"Six male pigeons played a repeated prisoner's dilemma game against a computer that reflected their choices: If a pigeon cooperated on trial n, the computer cooperated on trial n + 1; if the pigeon defected on trial n, the computer defected on trial n + 1. Cooperation thus maximized reinforcement in the long term, but defection was worth more on the current trial. Under these circumstances, pigeons normally defect. However, when a signal correlated with the pigeon's previous choice immediately followed each current trial choice, some pigeons learned to cooperate. Furthermore, cooperation was higher when trials were close together in time than when they were separated by long intertrial intervals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Examined the mutability of naturally occurring mutual cooperation and mutual defection. 45 pairs of Ss (male veterans aged 26-58 yrs) participated in an extended iterated prisoner's dilemma (median duration 1,807 trials) using a monetary payoff matrix. When stable cooperation or defection emerged, false feedback was provided indicating to each S that his partner was choosing contrary to previously stable play. This was followed by recovery trials in which false feedback indicated to each S that his partner had resumed making the previously stable choice. While stable cooperation occurred more frequently than stable defection, it was considerably more vulnerable to the false feedback manipulation. This was true both in terms of the extent to which choice changed in response to false feedback and in terms of the extent to which the disruption persisted. While the effect of 4 false feedback cooperations was undone by a single recovery false feedback defection, the effect of even a single false feedback defection was still apparent after 7 false feedback recovery cooperations.

Ss were told to play with others currently on the computer system and that the outcome would be determined by their choice and a new S's choice in each game. Ss were randomly shown other player's chosen strategy with the payoff matrix before their own decision making. The DE was evaluated against the comparable ETD principle by manipulating the dimensional differences: reversing or modifying payoffs in one's own or other players' dimensions in different versions of PD games. The results show that the ETD approach takes into account the relative payoffs for each player in the decision-making situation, yet allows for the individual's limited cognitive capacity to process all relevant information, thus it provides an alternative and seemingly better account of the DE observed for decision-making on the PD.

"Examined the role of trait anger (TA) and anger expression style on competitive/aggressive decision making and responding. In a 100-trial iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), with instructions to simulate wartime interactions, competition/aggression was defined as 'attacking the opponent', and 'waiting for troop reinforcements' was the noncompetitive alternative response. Prior to play, 92 university students completed the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. Ss were then paired to play the IPD against partners of similar or dissimilar TA levels. At postplay, the State Anger scale was readministered. Results showed significant preplay to postplay increases in state anger, with greater increases shown by high TA players. Ss in the high TA group made more competitive/attack responses, and they were more likely to do so when paired with a high TA partner. As a result of the high level of competitive/aggressive play, both groups ended with a negative troop count. TA as a general personality temperament was predictive of state anger, competitive/attack responses, and the number of trials before a retaliation was made. It is concluded that TA, especially TA/ temperament, and anger control difficulties may be toxic personality factors in decision making and competitive behavior.

"Extended research findings of C. Batson and T. Moran (see record [rid]1999-01521-005[/rid]) involving empathy-induced altruism (EIA) as a powerful motive of defection in a prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) and investigated the validity of the empathy–altruism hypothesis which, in contrast, predicts less defection among participants induced to feel empathy (self-interest counsels defection). Specifically, the authors examined EIA in a PDG in which participants knew their opponent (OP) had already defected. Ss were 60 female college students who were assigned to 3 conditions (20 Ss each): no communication, (NC); low-empathy (LE); and high-empathy (HE). In the NC condition, Ss were told that they would never meet, see, or know the name of their OPs. In the LE and HE conditions, Ss were told that they would not meet their OPs.

HE Ss were asked to try to imagine how the OP was feeling. After reading the note, LE and HE Ss completed an impression and feeling measure. The results support Batson's and Moran's findings. Among NC Ss, very few did not defect in return. Among LE and HE Ss, almost half did not defect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Each of four pigeons was exposed to a single random-ratio schedule of reinforcement in which the probability of reinforcement for a peck on either of two keys was 1/25. Reinforcer amounts were determined by an iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) matrix in which the 'other player' (a computer) played tit-for-tat. One key served as the cooperation (C) key; the other served as the defection (D) key. If a peck was scheduled to be reinforced and the D-key was pecked, the immediate reinforcer of that peck was always higher than it would have been had the C-key been pecked. However, if the C-key was pecked and the following peck was scheduled to be reinforced, reinforcement amount for pecks on either key were higher than they would have been if the previous peck had been on the D-key. Although immediate reinforcement was always higher for D-pecks, the overall reinforcement rate increased linearly with the proportion of C-pecks. C-pecks thus constituted a form of self-control. All the pigeons initially defected with this procedure. However, when feedback signals were introduced that indicated which key had last been pecked, cooperation (relative rate of C-pecks)--hence, self-control--increased for all the pigeons.

"Although it is clear that nonconscious primes can affect behavioral decisions, the extent to which the prime-to-behavior link is mediated by intervening interpretative processes is still unknown. The present research examined the mediational role of 'situational construals' by assessing the effects of cooperative versus competitive primes on participants' construals of, and responses to, the prisoner's dilemma. As predicted, this priming manipulation influenced participants' construals of the game (assessed by the participants' ratings of the appropriateness of different 'names for the game' and their estimates of how random others would play), and their own expressed willingness to cooperate versus defect. Most crucially, a mediational analysis and a manipulation of the order in which these dependent variables were measured established that the prime-to-behavior link can be strengthened by an intervening task calling for explicit construal of the situation. The interplay of situational construal and implicit primes in producing deliberative behavior is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Two experiments using the 'Prisoner's Dilemma with Variable Dependence' with a total of 70 subjects are reported. The cooperation rate was extremely high (95.1%) while the game was being repeated, but only half of the subjects cooperated in the final game. This suggests that cooperation in ongoing relations is supported by the 'shadow of the future' (Axelrod, 1984). Nonetheless, most subjects trusted a partner who had behaved cooperatively toward them in the repeated games (i.e., under an incentive structure that encouraged such behavior), even in the final game, in which such an incentive basis was absent. This result indicates that the subjects failed to distinguish the two bases of expecting benign behavior from interaction partners--trust based on the inferred personal traits of the partner and assurance of cooperation based on the nature of the incentive structure.

"The choice to 'cooperate' (maximize reward for the group) or 'defect' (maximize reward for the individual) is often attributed to altruistic or selfish motives. Alternatively, behavior during a dilemma may be understood as a function of reinforcement and punishment. 26 Ss played a prisoner's-dilemma-type game with a computer that employed either a teaching strategy (a probalistic version of tit-for-tat), in which the computer reinforced or punished Ss' cooperation or defection, or a learning strategy (a probalistic version of Pavlov), in which the computer's responses were reinforced and punished by Ss' cooperation and defection. Ss learned to cooperate against both computer strategies. In a second experiment which varied the context of the game, they learned to cooperate only against one or other strategy. 44 Ss participated. Ss did not learn to cooperate against tit-for-tat when they believed that they were playing against another person; Ss did not learn to cooperate against Pavlov when the computer's cooperation probability was signaled by a spinner. The results are consistent with the notion that people are biased not only to cooperate or defect on individual social choices, but also to employ one or other strategy of interaction in a pattern across social choices.

"Tit-For-Tat (TFT) has proven to be a strategy effective in promoting cooperation from the other player in 2-player prisoner's dilemma games (PDG). Following the reasoning that differences between social dilemmas involving more than two players and PDG are only differences of degree, some researchers have attempted to apply TFT in multi-player social dilemmas. The manner in which these experimenters have applied the reciprocity of TFT has been to have a number of 'dummy players' (DP's) in the social dilemma applying a straightforward TFT strategy against one real player. Results of these studies suggest that TFT can effectively increase cooperation in one player when more than half of the DP's are applying a TFT strategy against him/her. The present studies propose a different and more realistic manner of applying a reciprocal strategy in social dilemmas. In a 5-person prisoner's dilemma game (NPG), each person played against 4 DP's in which the distribution of DP choices reciprocated the player's choices. Simply put, the number of DP's cooperating on a given trial was a reflection of the player's choices on previous trials; many cooperations led many DP's to cooperate and many defections led many DP's to defect. Comparison of data from this modified TFT condition versus that from a condition in which the distribution of DP's choices was randomly determined on each trial (RAN) suggests that this reciprocal strategy did promote cooperation in many players. About half of the players exclusively cooperated in this condition, while almost all players in the RAN condition exclusively defected. A second exposure to the TFT condition improved level of cooperation further, though there still remained some players that did not cooperate. A follow-up experiment suggests that this improvement in level of cooperation during a second exposure to TFT is a result of the combined effects of the stop in play and the resetting of the DP distribution. Data from the RAN condition, where players had no effect on the future choices of DP's, suggest that players were themselves applying some version of reciprocity. Players were more likely to cooperate following a trial in which many DP's cooperated, and this declined within a session as the player learned the ineffectiveness of such a strategy. A weakness of TFT as a strategy is discussed as a possible explanation for the number of players who continued to exclusively defect in the TFT condition.

"Many researchers have argued that defection is the rational strategy in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) because it maximizes individual gain regardless of what one's opponent does. Conversely, cooperation enhances group gains, but only if adopted by all. The payoff structure of the PD ensures that for any probability of opponent cooperation, defection will remain the dominating strategy. Classic game theory implicitly assumes that the perceived probability of an opponent's cooperation is independent of the player's own intended choice. In contrast, the present research suggests that individuals may sequentially evaluate the possible outcomes for each choice. When predicting opponent behavior, individuals may anchor predictions about their opponent on their own behavior. Cooperation would then be the optimal strategy in the PD, since payoffs to the individual and group are higher for mutual cooperation than for mutual defection. In Studies 1-3, individual differences in projection were used to predict PD behavior, but were not good predictors. In Study 4, participants were explicitly provided with reciprocity information. In this study, cooperation increased monotonically with the probability of matching response from an opponent. In Study 5, participants were provided with information about the probability of opponent cooperation, information independent of participant choice. Here, cooperation was uniformly low. In Study 6, individuals played the PD against an ingroup or outgroup member. Although projection varied with group status, cooperation did not, thereby eliminating projection as a possible mediator of the relationship between group status and cooperation. Overall, explicit manipulations of probability values consistent with projection (i.e., information about opponent reciprocation of one's response) were more effective in eliciting cooperation than more implicit manipulations. In Studies 2-6, increases in the difference in payoff between mutual cooperation and mutual defection were also shown to increase cooperation.

"Investigated the conflictive decision making of communication by using the Prisoner's dilemma game based on PIM (problem interaction model). 36 college students participated. Initially they were divided into 9 cooperative groups and finally into 9 traitor groups. The experimental design consisted of 2 factors analysis of variables which was given by the multiplication of before the game/after the game and traitor groups/cooperative groups. The problem level that exists as independent variables comprised of traitor groups and cooperative groups given by the results of prisoner's dilemma game. Interaction level that exists as dependent variables is given by the meaning of 'movement of head asking for reaction' and 'nodding'. On the other hand, disqualification is represented by a smile on the face. Results indicate the number of 'nodding' is similar in the traitor groups and cooperative groups before the game. However, the number of 'nodding' in the traitor groups is decreased compared to the cooperative groups after the game. This study suggests that the conflictive decision making situation can be represented well by PIM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Results from previous studies have led many researchers to conclude that sex has no effect on cooperation in social dilemmas. This article reconciles strong theoretical expectations of sex differences in cooperation with the dearth of empirical evidence for such differences. I show that several theories of sex- or gender-related behavior suggest we should expect males and females to respond more strongly to greed and fear, respectively, in social dilemmas. I argue that previous research has failed to find differences because researchers have consistently used the Prisoners Dilemma game (or its public goods variants) to investigate whether sex affects cooperation. Because Prisoner's Dilemma contains both fear and greed, the theories outlined in this article predict no sex differences in cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma. A series of hypotheses about the conditions under which sex affects cooperation are proposed and tested against the results of two new studies. Results from both studies support two of the three hypotheses. I conclude by discussing some implications of the findings for collective action and inequality and by suggesting directions for future research.

"Two pigeons played Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) against a simulated opponent pre-programmed to play 'Tit-For-Tat' (TFT) and 'Random' (RND) strategies. Each pigeon received differential amounts of access to food following choices of either 'cooperate' or 'defect' on a trial. After 1000 trials against TFT and 500 trials against RND, results indicated that choice allocation was optimal when the birds played against RND but was sub-optimal when the birds played against TFT. In order to determine why the pigeons responded suboptimally against TFT, a trial-by-trial analysis of the data was conducted. The analysis revealed that once a pigeon had received the 'Sucker's' payoff, it was more likely to defect and receive the 'Temptation' payoff than to cooperate and receive the 'Reward' payoff. Local reinforcement contingencies appear to determine suboptimal responding against TFT in the iterated Pigeon's Dilemma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The authors' goal is to see if people with different propensities to cooperate exhibit differing degrees of trust and reciprocity.

However when it comes to reciprocal behavior, cooperating subjects do not behave differently than subjects who choose to defect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Electronic communication allows interactions to take place over great distances. The authors build an agent-based model to explore whether networks that do not rely on geographic proximity can support cooperation as well as local interactions can. Adaptive agents play a four-move Prisoner's Dilemma game, where an agent's strategy specifies the probability of cooperating on the first move, and the probability of cooperating contingent on the partner's previous choice. After playing with four others, an agent adjusts its strategy so that more successful strategies are better represented in the succeeding round. The surprising result is that if the pattern of interactions is selected at random, but is persistent over time, cooperation emerges just as strongly as it does when interactions are geographically local. This has implications for both research on social dynamics, and for the prospects for building social capital in the modem age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Maintains that research examining the relationship between the allocentrism-ideocentrism cultural variable and cooperation in social dilemmas is inconsistent. This relationship is considered in the context of social values within the prisoner's dilemma (PDG) in 2 studies.

In Study 1 (n = 93, aged 18–25 yrs) the hypothesis was supported. Study 2, including 30 British (mean age 20.4 yrs) and 30 Malaysian (mean age 20.9 yrs) respondents, replicated and extended these results to rankings of PDG outcomes.

Inconsistent with the discontinuity hypothesis, but consistent with goal-expectation theory, results indicated that repeated communications increased cooperation to an equal extent for individuals and groups; and that groups had stronger cooperative expectations of, and attributed less competitiveness to their opponent, than individuals. Findings suggest an individual-group continuity effect, rather than a discontinuity effect, within the context of repeated PDG interactions and communications between individuals and groups.

"Analyzed via formalized models the role of social structure in maintaining cooperation within a population of adaptive agents for whom cooperative behavior may be costly in the short run. The example used is of a collection of agents playing pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma. Sustained cooperative behavior in such circumstances is termed a 'cooperative regime', a coherent, self-sustaining entity that is something more than the sum of the pairwise interactions among its members. It is shown that social structure, by channeling which agents interact with which others, can sustain cooperative regimes against forces that frequently dissolve them. The process is shown in detail how structured interaction in a population creates a 'shadow of the adaptive future', allowing even a small set of cooperative strategies to grow into a cooperative regime. Implications are discussed for concrete issues, such as maintenance of trust in the Internet. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Results show that 65 Ss were classified as cooperators and 82 Ss were competitors. TFT was more effective than was permissive or punitive TFT in inducing cooperation from competitors. Moreover, TFT's potency in inducing cooperation from competitors was quite strong, as it was able to induce almost the same level of cooperation from competitors as from cooperators. The 3 reciprocal strategies were similar in their effectiveness for inducing cooperation from cooperators. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Three experiments examined the role of intragroup social influence in intergroup competition. In the context of a mutual fate control situation, participants in Exp 1 demonstrated more intergroup competition in the presence than in the absence of social support for shared self-interest. Exp 2 revealed that, in the context of a Prisoner's Dilemma Game, this social support effect was stronger when noncorrespondence of outcomes between the interacting groups was low than when it was high. Results from Exp 3 were consistent with the possibility that the effect of social support is attenuated when noncorrespondence of outcomes is high because under these circumstances intergroup competition is prescribed by a norm of group interest.

"In contrast to typically developing children, most children with autism rarely exhibit cooperative social behavior. However, it is not yet clear whether this deficit reflects a delay in overall development or specific social-cognitive deficits and personality characteristics that hinder their acquisition of this behavior. Therefore, the present study examined the social-cognitive skills, personality characteristics, and behavioral development of children with autism who had IQ's within the average range. These children were compared to children diagnosed with other social deficits (specifically children diagnosed with ADHD/ODD) and typically developing peers. Participants were ten high functioning children with autism (IQ > 85), 19 children with ADHD/ODD, and 10 typically developing children. All were boys. Participants were administered the Social Orientation Choice Card, tests of social perspective taking (understanding others' emotions), a Prisoner's Dilemma task, and the Vocabulary and Block Design subtests of the WISC-III or WPPSI-R. Parents completed the Behavioral Development Questionnaire. The high functioning children with autism outperformed the children with ADHD/ODD and did not differ significantly from the typically developing children on the following variables: cooperative behavior, level of emotional understanding on the theory of mind task, and aloof behavior. However, there was evidence for an autism-specific deficit in the ability to recognize emotional facial expressions. Further, the children with autism were rated as exhibiting more active but odd behavior and less typically developing behavior than their typically developing peers. Thus, the results indicate that high functioning children with autism can develop advanced theory of mind abilities and engage in cooperative social interactions. However, they continue to show some social-cognitive and behavioral deficits, although those deficits may not be as severe as in children with ADHD/ODD. Future research should further assess whether specific skills and attitudes affect the ability of children with autism to interact with peers and whether treatment can address the deficits identified.

"Anger is a frequent emotion, which is sometimes intense, persistent and enduring. It is associated with a variety of negative outcomes such as coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, occupational and family maladjustment, erratic driving, etc., and can be a precursor to aggression. Thus, it is important to investigate those variables that mediate its expression. In this study, anger expression was examined in four social context conditions: social-encouragement (to outwardly express anger), social-discouragement (to hold anger in), social-neutral (no prompt for anger expression), and solitary (no observer). Gender differences in anger expression were also examined. Sixty men and sixty women engaged in a Prisoner's Dilemma based anger induction procedure labeled as WAR. Angry feelings were assessed at pre-test and post-test by the Spielberger State Anger Scale (1999). The frequency of competitive responses was assessed as part of the WAR task and provided a behavioral measure of anger expression. In addition, while playing WAR, the participants typed responses to their opponents and these were coded as indicators of verbal anger expression. Results showed that the sample as a whole significantly increased in state anger from pre-test to post-test. Subjects in social-encouragement and solitary social context groups significantly increased in state anger scores from pre-test to post-test. Both men and women made significant increases in State Anger from pre-test to post-test. Social Context groups did not differ in State Anger at post-test, nor did men and women. A main effect of social context on angry typed responses was found. The order (highest to lowest) of social context groups according to their mean angry-typed responses scores was encouragement, solitary, neutral, and discouragement, respectively. A main effect of gender on frequency of competitive responses was also found. Men scored significantly higher than women in their behavioral anger expression. These results support the important role of the social environment as a final determinant of anger expression. When angry, subjects were guided by the presence and behavior of the observer (confederate) when engaging in verbal modes of responding. Confirming traditional gender specific modes of expressing anger, men more frequently expressed their anger with outward 'attacks.' (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This project investigates the role that temporal structure plays in a number of well-studied psychological tasks, with particular attention to recency effects. Recency effects are defined as increased memory for recent information, as well as preferential reliance on such information in determining responses. Such behavior is often interpreted as suboptimal, indicating limitations of human cognitive architecture. However, recent research suggests that recency effects reflect an adaptation to the temporal structure of our cognitive environment, and furthermore one which is adjustable (J. R. Anderson & Schooler, 2000; R. B. Anderson et al., 1997). I elaborate on this perspective through studies of verbal working memory, category learning, and game theory. First, a computational model of working memory, based on recurrent neural networks, is presented which exhibits transient storage of information, with a characteristic decay time that adapts to the task environment. This model is extended to a model of verbal serial recall that can explain all of the most robust phenomena associated with the task. Next, data are presented from an empirical investigation of repeated cued classification, in which the serial correlation among category outcomes is manipulated. The results show that recency effects in this task are adaptable as well, and a modification to existing categorization models is proposed to account for this adaptation. Finally, recency effects in simple social interactions are investigated using the framework of iterated matrix games. It is proven analytically that under reasonable conditions it is individually rational for all players to act with an arbitrarily short memory span. This result is applied to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma to derive a class of rational yet cooperative policies for that game. Together, these three investigations show how choosing actions based primarily on recent events can be rational in certain situations, lead to proposals of specific psychological mechanisms for online learning and adjusting of the magnitude of recency effects, and demonstrate that inclusion of these mechanisms within models of choice and memory performance can provide unified explanations of adaptive recency effects with other established phenomena.

"Support theory provides an account of how different but equivalent verbal descriptions of the same event can give rise to bias in probability judgment. To the extent that a description provides specific examples of an event, people provide more extreme probability judgments of that event than they if they had read a broad description of the event. Considerable research has demonstrated support theory biases, but none has examined how social factors affect these biases. Therefore, this dissertation demonstrated two different ways in which social factors moderate support theory biases. Specifically, the first pair of experiments demonstrated how the social content of judged events causes support theory biases, and the third experiment demonstrated how aspects of the social environment attenuate support theory biases. In the first pair of experiments, participants read stories depicting strategic interactions of interest to game theorists: the Prisoner's Dilemma Game or the Game of Chicken. Then, participants considered alternative ways in which the story could have ended, described either broadly or as specific examples of alternative ways. The results demonstrated a support theory bias: participants who considered specific alternative ways in which the story could have ended inflated their probability judgments of those endings compared to participants who considered the broad description of alternative endings. The third experiment explored whether or not an aspect of the social environment, namely holding people accountable, attenuates support theory biases. Participants read either a broad description of an event that could happen next year or one with specific examples of the event and judged the probability of that event. In addition, some participants believed they would have to explain and justify their judgments to an expert, while others did not. The participants who believed they would have to explain and justify their judgments showed significantly reduced support theory biases. The results these experiments demonstrate how social psychological factors can either magnify or attenuate support theory biases. In the process, these experiments reveal conditions under which social factors cause people either to deviate from normative standards for judgment or to conform to those standards.

"Emotional reasoning is emotionally-based cognition operating on subjective terms, independent of rationality, and using feelings as criteria. In Study 1, 113 participants, 29 men and 84 women, focussed either on their feelings or on the reasons for their choices as they made a series of decisions in a card-playing game. Contrary to predictions, participants who focussed on their feelings were less likely to make optimal decisions in the game. This study thus provided no evidence that emotional reasoning can reach optimal conclusions. In a second study, 96 participants, 35 men and 61 women, made a series of decisions to cooperate or compete with an unseen partner in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Participants who focussed on their feelings were less likely to compete than participants who focussed on reasons for making each decision, so that they did less well in the short term, but significantly better over the long term, than participants in the Reasons condition. Participants who described themselves as highly rational were also less likely to do well in the game. This study demonstrates that emotional reasoning can be more effective than rational decision-making. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"While the prisoner's dilemma classically shows the incentives that encourage defection, in recent years theorists have made use of computer simulations to search for the conditions under which cooperation can emerge. Concurrently, other researchers have developed the social (or Machiavellian) intelligence hypothesis, which suggests that human intelligence evolved primarily for the purpose of navigating a complex social space composed of conspecifics whose interests are in part mutual, but also in part conflicting. These lines of research are brought together in a computer simulation that models the evolution of cooperation and social intelligence in an ecology that offers opportunities not only for cooperation, but for conflict as well. I show that when agents with even a limited ability to perceive each other's intentions interact in an ecology that offers a choice between games, likely defectors are non-randomly offered opportunities for conflict and excluded from potentially cooperative interactions, resulting in lesser gains and cross-generational selection against the tendency to defect.

endowments on observed contributions in a linear public good game. Our
results suggest that contribution levels were significantly lower when
groups had heterogeneous rather than homogeneous endowments, with this
finding being independent of the origin of endowment. We did not find,
however, that the lack of free-riding in public goods experiments was an
artifact of endowment origin. Group members contributed about the same
to the public good whether their endowments were earned or not. (c) 2004

"{Although collective efforts are common in both animal and human
societies, many human and probably animal social dilemmas have no
obvious cooperative solution, which is a challenge for evolutionary
biologists. In public goods games, i.e. the experimental paradigm for
studying the sustainability of a public resource with human subjects,
initial cooperation usually declines quickly. Recently, it has been
shown that the interaction with another social game in which good
reputation attracts help, can maintain a high level of cooperation in
the public goods game. Here we show experimentally that humans use
different strategies in the public goods game conditional on whether the
player knows that his decisions will be either known or unknown in
another social game. The knowledge of being recognized as the same
individual in both scenarios motivates players to invest in their
reputation and thus sustain the public resource. However, cooperation
declines immediately when individual identities switch from being
recognizable to being unrecognizable between the two interacting games.}"
"{This study examines social preferences in three distinct field
environments. In the first field setting, I allow consumers of all age
and education levels to participate in one-shot and multiple-shot public
goods games in a well-functioning marketplace. The second field study,
an actual university capital campaign, gathers data front mail
solicitations sent to 2,000 Central Florida residents. In the third
field experiment, I examine data from an uncontrolled environment, a
television gameshow, which closely resembles the classic prisoner's
dilemma game. Several insights emerge; perhaps the most provocative is
that age and social preferences appear linked.}"
"{This paper reports the results of the Ultimatum Game (UG), Dictator Game
(DG) and Public Goods Game (PGG) played among the Tsimane, a group of
forager-horticulturalists living in the Bolivian Amazon. Game results
differ significantly from those commonly reported among modem,
westernized populations. Without a long history of anonymous
interactions, it is highly suspect whether the Tsimane or other
traditional populations play economic games under assumptions of
anonymity and one-shot exposure. Employing a behavioral ecology
framework, I test predictions that differential market exposure, costs
of giving, and experience with cooperation can help explain much of the
variance in game outcomes. While these factors sometimes act as
important predictors of game behavior, the most significant predictor is
village membership. Implications for understanding the role of markets,
frequent interaction with strangers, and payoffs to cooperation in daily
life can help us better understand cross-cultural variation in
pro-social behavior.}"
"{We report experimental results on the effects that auctioning the right
to play a public goods game with a provision point may have on
equilibrium selection and individual behavior. Auctioning off such a
right among a larger population of players strikingly enhances public
good provision. Once public good provision is obtained, the auction
price at the preliminary stage increases to its upper limit, dissipating
all players' gains associated with the provision of the public good.
Individual deviations from the equilibrium strategy are neither able to
force lower market prices nor to affect provision of the public good in
subsequent periods.}"
"{Collective efforts are a trademark of both insect and human
societies(1). They are achieved through relatedness in the former(2) and
unknown mechanisms in the latter. The problem of achieving cooperation
among non-kin has been described as the `tragedy of the commons',
prophesying the inescapable collapse of many human enterprises(3,4). In
public goods experiments, initial cooperation usually drops quickly to
almost zero(5). It can be maintained by the opportunity to punish
defectors(6) or the need to maintain good reputation(7). Both schemes
require that defectors are identified. Theorists propose that a simple
but effective mechanism operates under full anonymity. With optional
participation in the public goods game, `loners' (players who do not
join the group), defectors and cooperators will coexist through
rock-paper-scissors dynamics(8,9). Here we show experimentally that
volunteering generates these dynamics in public goods games and that
manipulating initial conditions can produce each predicted direction.
If, by manipulating displayed decisions, it is pretended that defectors
have the highest frequency, loners soon become most frequent, as do
cooperators after loners and defectors after cooperators. On average,
cooperation is perpetuated at a substantial level.}"
"{The puzzle of the emergence of cooperation between unrelated individuals
is shared across diverse fields of behavioural sciences and economics.
In this article we combine the public goods game originating in
economics with evolutionary approaches traditionally used in biology.
Instead of pairwise encounters, we consider the more complex case of
groups of three interacting individuals. We show that territoriality is
capable of promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the
Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities, the
readiness to cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies can be
largely suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation for
being willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and fair
outcomes are achieved. This group-beneficial result is obtained,
intriguingly, by making individuals more likely to exploit their
co-players if they can get away with it. Thus, less-cooperative
individuals make more-cooperative societies.}"
"{We explore three two-person public goods games with similar equilibrium
predictions, but with different rules of the game, different payoff
possibilities, and, as we show, different choices by subjects.
Comparisons among games allow inferences of what may or may not
determine when the equilibrium prediction is a good approximation of
actual behavior. We find that the equilibrium prediction can fail even
when incentives off the equilibrium enforce it. Our result suggests that
the selfish prediction is prone to deviations when the equilibrium
results in unequal distributions of payoffs, and there are alternative
outcomes that increase both equality and the payoff of the disadvantaged
party. Furthermore, fairness is a function of more than just the final
allocations to subjects; it depends on the actions not chosen as well as
those that are. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).}"

"{An increase in the common marginal value of a public good has two
effects: it increases the benefit of a contribution to others, and it
reduces the net cost of making a contribution. These two effects can be
decomposed by letting a contribution have an `internal' return for
oneself that differs from the `external' return to someone else. We use
this framework in a series of one-shot public goods games in which
subjects make choices in ten treatments with no feedback. Contributions
are generally increasing in the external return and group size, which
suggests that altruism in this context is not simply of the `warm glow'
variety, i.e. giving only for the sake of giving. Contributions are also
increasing in the internal return, indicating that decisions are
sensitive to the costs of helping others. We specify a logit equilibrium
model in which individuals are motivated by own and others' earnings,
and in which choice is stochastic. Maximum likelihood estimates of
(representative-agent) altruism and logit parameters are significant and
of reasonable magnitudes, and the resulting two-parameter model tracks
the pattern of contributions across the ten treatments. A richer model
reveals some differences in individual altruism coefficients, with more
dispersion among male subjects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

"{An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that cooperation in a
social dilemma context could be facilitated by inducing participants to
emit ``social psychophysical{''} cues, information in the perceptual
array that affords meaningful and consequential social inferences. In
particular, participants were asked to engage in mutual eye gaze, to
touch one another gently, to communicate in a virtual chat room, or to
tap out rhythms in synchrony. All but the last of these manipulations
increased contributions to a public good in all-male but not all-female
groups. These results suggest the inference systems that are engaged
when individuals make decisions about whether or not to cooperate in a
group context are responsive to relatively low level nonverbal
behavioral cues.}"
"{Research using the public goods game to examine behaviour in the context
of social dilemmas has repeatedly shown substantial individual
differences in patterns of contributions to the public good. We present
here a new method specifically designed to capture this heterogeneity in
play and classify participants into broad categories or types. Players
in groups of four made initial, simultaneous contributions to the public
good. Subsequently, players were sequentially told the current aggregate
contribution to the public good and allowed to change their decision
based on this information. The game continued, with players updating
their contribution decision until the game ended at an unknown point. By
looking at the relationship between players' contributions and the
aggregate value they observed, we were able to cleanly, classify 82\% of
our players into three types: strong free riders (28\%), conditional
cooperators of reciprocators (29\%), and strong cooperators (25\%). We
also found that scores on some of the personality dimensions we
investigated (self-monitoring, self-esteem, neuroticism, and
conscientiousness) correlated with player type. Finally, males were
found to be more likely to be strong cooperators than females. Copyright

Specifically: the question is addressed whether individuals think

belief learning models assume that people abstract from strategic
considerations. Using an incentive-compatible mechanism, experimental
data are obtained on subjects' expectations in a step-level public good

evidence that strategic considerations do not play a role. The evidence
is consistent with predictions derived from rite naive Bayesian model.}"
"While bicultural research has begun to examine how biculturals identify with different cultures, bicultural identities tend to be organized in a complex manner than influences how they interact with the outside world. In this experimental study we examined whether undergraduate Asian-American biculturals can be primed to identify with Asian or American ethnic-cultural groups as in-groups, measured by in-group favoritism in resource allocation in a variant of a prisoner's dilemma game, and whether this is moderated by the blendedness dimension of bicultural identity integration (BII-Blendedness). Results showed that biculturals can be primed to express in-group favoritism towards different ethnic groups, and that this relationship is moderated by the level of BII-Blendedness in a manner that is consistent with past BII research. These findings provide empirical support for past discussions on how biculturals shift between cultural identities, and highlight that how biculturals feel about their dual identities is an important influencing factor.

"Ontogenic studies of human prosociality generally agree on that human prosociality increases from early childhood through early adulthood; however, it has not been established if prosociality increases beyond early adulthood. We examined a sample of 408 nonstudent residents from Tokyo, Japan, who were evenly distributed across age (20–59) and sex. Participants played five economic games each separated by a few months. We demonstrated that prosocial behavior increased with age beyond early adulthood and this effect was shown across all five economic games. A similar, but weaker, age-related trend was found in one of three social value orientation measures of prosocial preferences. We measured participants’ belief that manipulating others is a wise strategy for social success, and found that this belief declined with age. Participants’ satisfaction with the unilateral exploitation outcome of the prisoner’s dilemma games also declined with age. These two factors—satisfaction with the DC outcome in the prisoner’s dilemma games and belief in manipulation— mediated the age effect on both attitudinal and behavioral prosociality. Participants’ age-related socio-demographic traits such as marriage, having children, and owning a house weakly mediated the age effect on prosociality through their relationships with satisfaction with the DC outcome and belief in manipulation.

"Perceiving other people’s actions triggers activity in premotor and parietal areas, brain areas also involved in executing and sensing our own actions. Paralleling this phenomenon, observing emotional states (including pain) in others is associated with activity in the same brain areas as activated when experiencing similar emotions directly. This emotion perception associated activity has been shown to be affected by the perceived fairness of the actor, and in-group membership more generally. Here, we examine whether action observation associated brain activity is also affected by the perceived social fairness of the actors. Perceived fairness was manipulated using an alternating iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game between the participant and two confederates, one of whom played fairly and the other unfairly. During fMRI scanning the participants watched movies of the confederates performing object-directed hand actions, and then performed hand actions themselves. Massunivariate analysis showed that observing the actions triggered robust activation in regions associated with action execution, but failed to identify a strong modulation of this activation based on perceived fairness. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, identified clusters potentially carrying information about the perceived fairness of the actor in the middle temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, right middle cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, and right superioroccipital gyrus. Despite being identified by a whole-brain searchlight analysis (and so without anatomical restriction), these clusters fall into areas frequently associated with action observation. We conclude that brain activity during action observation may be modulated by perceived fairness, but such modulation is subtle; robust activity is associated with observing the actions of both fair and unfair individuals.

"Objective: Visionary images are identity-relevant, picture-like mental representations of a desirable and attainable future appearing regularly in a person’s stream of thought. Prior research indicates that both mental and real images provide access to implicit motives. We therefore proposed that visionary images motivate people by arousing their implicit motives and tested this hypothesis in two experimental studies. Method: We used guided visualizations to administer motive-domain-specific visionary images (Study 1: achievement and neutral, Mage = 24.4, 51 participants, 34 women; Study 2: affiliation and power, Mage = 24.01, 51 participants, 28 women) to arouse the respective implicit motive. Motivation was measured via residual changes in affective (i.e., changes in affective arousal), behavioral (i.e., performance on a concentration task, behavioral choices in a prisoner’s dilemma), and mental (i.e., motive imagery in the Picture Story Exercise) indicators of motivation. Results: The results largely confirmed our hypothesis. Visionary images increased motivation in the targeted domain. Some effects were moderated by participants’ implicit motives. Conclusions: The findings underscore the role of implicit motives in understanding the motivational effectiveness of visionary images. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Imagined contact is a relatively new technique designed to focus the accumulated knowledge of over 500 studies of intergroup contact into a simple and versatile prejudice-reduction intervention. While it is now clear that imagined contact can improve intergroup attitudes, its ability to change actual intergroup behavior is less well established. Some emerging findings provide cause for optimism with nonverbal, and unobtrusive measures of behavior. This paper extends this work by adopting methods from behavioral economics to examine more deliberative behavior. Participants believed they were playing a prisoner’s dilemma with an outgroup member. They could choose whether to cooperate or compete with the other player. In three studies, we provide reliable evidence that imagined contact (vs. control) successfully encouraged more prosocial, cooperative choices. In the third study we show that this effect is mediated by increased trust towards the outgroup member. The findings demonstrate that imagined contact interventions can have a tangible impact on volitional intergroup behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Notwithstanding the fact that valuing personality descriptors from the realm of character were deliberately excluded from the Big Five model of personality, in the study of economic games (EGs; e.g., the prisoner's dilemma) the Big Five were used when predicting outcomes in the field of behaviors that are socially valued in terms of fairness and altruism (i.e., the moral domain). Eventually evaluative traits were introduced and found useful in the study of EGs, namely the HEXACO dimension honesty/humility (H/H). As an extensive list of evaluative traits, the Values In Action classification of character strengths may complement H/H when assessing character and predicting individuals' decisions in EGs. For this study, N = 155 participants completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, a measure of the HEXACO traits, and four different EGs that involved decisions relevant to fairness and altruism. Along with H/H, individuals' positions on a dimension abstracting heart-related vs. mind-related character strengths predicted outcomes in the EGs. These results support earlier findings that evaluative traits predict decisions relevant to fairness and altruism. Furthermore, character strengths can be seen as complementing H/H when predicting behavior in the moral domain by character. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Introduction: The oxytocin system is involved in human social behavior and social cognition such as attachment, emotion recognition and mentalizing (i.e. the ability to represent mental states of oneself and others). It is shaped by social experiences in early life, especially by parent–infant interactions. The single nucleotid polymorphism rs53576 in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene has been linked to social behavioral phenotypes. Method: In 195 adult healthy subjects we investigated the interaction of OXTR rs53576 and childhood attachment security (CAS) on the personality traits 'adult attachment style' and 'alexithymia' (i.e. emotional self-awareness), on brain structure (voxel-based morphometry) and neural activation (fMRI) during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (prisoner's dilemma game; subgroup: n = 163). Results: We found that in GG-homozygotes, but not in A-allele carriers, insecure childhood attachment is—in adulthood—associated with a) higher attachment-related anxiety and alexithymia, b) higher brain gray matter volume of left amygdala and lower volumes in right superior parietal lobule (SPL), left temporal pole (TP), and bilateral frontal regions, and c) higher mentalizing-related neural activity in bilateral TP and precunei, and right middle and superior frontal gyri. Interaction effects of genotype and CAS on brain volume and/or function were associated with individual differences in alexithymia and attachment-related anxiety. Interactive effects were in part sexually dimorphic. Conclusion: The interaction of OXTR genotype and CAS modulates adult personality as well as brain structure and function of areas implicated in salience processing and mentalizing. Rs53576 GG-homozygotes are partially more susceptible to childhood attachment experiences than A-allele carriers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"When playing games of strategic interaction, such as iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and iterated Chicken Game, people exhibit specific within-game learning (e.g., learning a game’s optimal outcome) as well as transfer of learning between games (e.g., a game’s optimal outcome occurring at a higher proportion when played after another game). The reciprocal trust players develop during the first game is thought to mediate transfer of learning effects. Recently, a computational cognitive model using a novel trust mechanism has been shown to account for human behavior in both games, including the transfer between games. We present the results of a study in which we evaluate the model’s a priori predictions of human learning and transfer in 16 different conditions. The model’s predictive validity is compared against five model variants that lacked a trust mechanism. The results suggest that a trust mechanism is necessary to explain human behavior across multiple conditions, even when a human plays against a non-human agent. The addition of a trust mechanism to the other learning mechanisms within the cognitive architecture, such as sequence learning, instance-based learning, and utility learning, leads to better prediction of the empirical data. It is argued that computational cognitive modeling is a useful tool for studying trust development, calibration, and repair. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

engaged participants in a series of joint action tasks which, for one
group of participants, was interleaved with a PGG, and measured their
heart synchrony and arousal. We found that the introduction of the
economic game shifted participants' attention to the dynamics of the
interaction. This was followed by increased arousal and synchrony of
heart rate profiles. Also, the degree of heart rate synchrony was
predictive of participants' expectations regarding their partners in the

difference in these games in pro-sociality when interacting with own
group members as compared with members of another group). We find that
it is not. An examination of the Big-5 personality predictors of each
behavior reinforces this result: they are different. In short, knowing
how pro-social individuals are with respect to fellow group members does
not help predict their parochialism.}"
"{In mixed-motive games, people must choose between acting upon selfish

mixed-motive games should be substantially related; (2) all these games
should substantially appeal to dispositional variables that probe in the
psychological conflict between self and others; and (3) these
dispositional variables should explain the shared variance among various
games. These hypotheses were tested among undergraduate students (N=219)
who played seven different single-shot mixed-motive games and one
sequential game. Social Value Orientation and the ideological attitudes
Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism were

did not fully substantiate our hypotheses, which calls into question the

selfish interests and concern for others salient. In the discussion, we

"{In public goods situations, a specific destructive behaviour reliably
emerges when individuals face the possibility of costly punishing
others: antisocial punishment, that is, costly punishing cooperative
individuals. So far, however, little is known about the individual
differences and situational factors that are associated with the dark
side of costly punishment. This research deals with this shortcoming. We
argue that antisocial punishment reflects the basic characteristics of
sadism, namely, aggressive behaviour to dominate and to harm other
individuals. We further argue that antisocial punishment may reflect a
type of behaviour that allows for the maintenance of self-esteem
(through aggressively dominating others). Therefore, we expect that
individuals who report a disposition for everyday sadism are
particularly likely to engage in antisocial punishment when their self
has been threatened (by thinking about one's own death). In a study
(N=99), we found empirical support for this assumption. The present
research contributes to a better understanding of antisocial punishment

"{The strengths of social norms vary considerably across cultures, yet
little research has shown whether such differences have an evolutionary
basis. Integrating research in cross-cultural psychology with
evolutionary game theory, we show that groups that face a high degree of
threat develop stronger norms for organizing social interaction, with a
higher degree of norm-adherence and higher punishment for deviant
behavior. Conversely, groups that have little threat can afford to have
weaker norms with less punishment for deviance. Our results apply to two
kinds of norms: norms of cooperation, in which individuals must choose
whether to cooperate (thereby benefitting everyone) or enrich themselves
at the expense of others; and norms of coordination, in which there are
several equally good ways for individuals to coordinate their actions,
but individuals need to agree on which way to coordinate. This is the
first work to show that different degrees of norm strength are
evolutionarily adaptive to societal threat. Evolutionary game theoretic
models of cultural adaptation may prove fruitful for exploring the
causes of many other cultural differences that may be adaptive to

psychometric measures of self-control and impulsivity. Consistent with
our hypothesis, we found in the treatments that render money more

"{The disposition for prosocial conduct, which contributes to cooperation
as arising during social interaction, requires cortical network dynamics
responsive to the development of social ties, or care about the
interests of specific interaction partners. Here, we formulate a dynamic
computational model that accurately predicted how tie formation, driven
by the interaction history, influences decisions to contribute in a
public good game. We used model-driven functional MRI to test the
hypothesis that brain regions key to social interactions keep track of
dynamics in tie strength. Activation in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex tracked the individual's public
good contributions. Activation in the bilateral posterior superior
temporal sulcus (pSTS), and temporo-parietal junction was modulated
parametrically by the dynamically developing social tie-as estimated by
our model-supporting a role of these regions in social tie formation.
Activity in these two regions further reflected inter-individual
differences in tie persistence and sensitivity to behavior of the
interaction partner. Functional connectivity between pSTS and mPFC
activations indicated that the representation of social ties is
integrated in the decision process. These data reveal the brain
mechanisms underlying the integration of interaction dynamics into a
social tie representation which in turn influenced the individual's
prosocial decisions.}"
"{Theory and correlational research suggest that connecting with nature
may facilitate prosocial and environmentally sustainable behaviors. In
three studies we test causal direction with experimental manipulations
of nature exposure and laboratory analogs of cooperative and sustainable
behavior. Participants who watched a nature video harvested more
cooperatively and sustainably in a fishing-themed commons dilemma,
compared to participants who watched an architectural video (Study 1 and
2) or geometric shapes with an audio podcast about writing (Study 2).
The effects were not due to mood, and this was corroborated in Study 3
where pleasantness and nature content were manipulated independently in
a 2 x 2 design. Participants exposed to nature videos responded more
cooperatively on a measure of social value orientation and indicated
greater willingness to engage in environmentally sustainable behaviors.
Collectively, results suggest that exposure to nature may increase
cooperation, and, when considering environmental problems as social
dilemmas, sustainable intentions and behavior. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"{Prosociality is one of the most distinctive features of human beings but
there are individual differences in cooperative behavior. Employing the
twin method, we examined the heritability of cooperativeness and its
outcomes on public goods games using a strategy method. In two

indicate (1) how much they would contribute to a group when they did not
know how much the other group members were contributing, and (2) how
much they would contribute if they knew the contributions of others.
Overall, the heritability estimates were relatively small for each type
of decision, but heritability was greater when participants knew that
the others had made larger contributions. Using registered decisions in
Study 2, we conducted seven Monte Carlo simulations to examine genetic
and environmental influences on the expected game payoffs. For the

comparable to those of game decisions. For the simulated iterated games,
we found that the genetic influences first decreased, then increased as
the numbers of iterations grew. The implication for the evolution of
individual differences in prosociality is discussed.}"
"{Culture has an essential influence on online trust building in close
relationships. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect
of culture on interpersonal trust and online information-sharing in
close relationships. A social dilemma game experiment was conducted by
inviting close friend dyads from interdependent (that is, Chinese) or
independent cultures (that is, German). Their trust and
information-sharing performance in either online text chatting or
face-to-face communication were examined. The results showed that in
close relationships, Chinese participants had higher interpersonal trust
and objective-sharing performance than German participants; Chinese
trust and self-evaluated performance were not influenced by
communication media; in comparison, German participants' trust and
self-evaluated performance significantly dropped online. The results
confirmed that interdependent people are more relation-oriented in
building their trust than independent people. Implications for online
information-sharing management and the interface design were provided.}"
"{Recent work using decontextualized economic games suggests that
cooperation is a dynamic decision-making process: Automatic responses
typically support cooperation on average, while deliberation leads to
increased selfishness. Here, we performed two studies examining how
these temporal effects generalize to games with richer social context
cues. Study 1 found that time pressure increased cooperation to a
similar extent in games played with in-group members and out-group
members. Study 2 found that time pressure increased cooperation to a
similar extent in games described as competitions and games described as
collaborations. These results show that previous positive effects of
time pressure on cooperation are not unique to neutrally framed games
devoid of social context and are not driven by implicit assumptions of
shared group membership or cooperative norms. In doing so, our findings
provide further insight into the cognitive underpinnings of cooperative
decision making. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}"
"{Decision-making in social dilemmas is suggested to rely on three
factors: the valuation of a choice option, the relative judgment of two
or more choice alternatives, and individual factors affecting the ease
at which judgments and decisions are made. Here, we test whether
empathy-an individual's relative ability to understand others' thoughts,
emotions, and intentions-acts as an individual factor that alleviates
conflict resolution in social decision-making. We test this by using a
framed, iterated prisoners' dilemma (PD) game in two settings. In a
behavioral experiment, we find that individual differences in empathic
ability (the Empathy Quotient, EQ) were related to lower response times
in the PD game, suggesting that empathy is related to faster social
choices, independent of whether they choose to cooperate or defect. In a
subsequent neuroimaging experiment, using functional magnetic resonance
imaging, we find that EQ is positively related to individual differences
in the engagement of brain structures implemented in mentalizing,
including the precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that empathy is related to the
individual difference in the engagement of mentalizing in social
dilemmas and that this is related to the efficiency of decision-making
in social dilemmas.}"
"{It has often been argued that the spectacular cognitive capacities of
humans are the result of selection for the ability to gather, process,
and use information about other people. Recent studies show that humans
strongly and consistently differ in what type of social information they
are interested in. Although some individuals mainly attend to what the
majority is doing (frequency-based learning), others focus on the
success that their peers achieve with their behavior (success-based
learning). Here, we show that such differences in social learning have
important consequences for the outcome of social interactions. We report
on a decision-making experiment in which individuals were first
classified as frequency- and success-based learners and subsequently
grouped according to their learning strategy. When confronted with a
social dilemma situation, groups of frequency-based learners cooperated
considerably more than groups of success-based learners. A detailed
analysis of the decision-making process reveals that these differences
in cooperation are a direct result of the differences in information
use. Our results show that individual differences in social learning
strategies are crucial for understanding social behavior.}"
"{Children who witness bullying often do not defend victims. Bystanders
might be reticent to intervene because they are stuck in ``social
dilemmas.{''} Social dilemmas are situations in which individuals make
decisions based on self-interest due to their lack of confidence that
others will join with them in decisions that benefit the collective. In
this study, the social dilemmas concept, which comes from game theory
and social psychology, was applied to bullying for the first time. A
total of 292 middle school students at a private residential school in
the United States completed surveys about their bullying-related
experiences within their residences of 10 to 12 students of the same
gender. Multilevel modeling was employed to assess if and how attitudes,
group norms, and social dilemmas predict behavior in bullying
situations. The findings suggested that both individual and group
factors were associated with behavior in bullying situations and that
attitudes, group norms, and social dilemmas each made a unique
contribution to predicting behavior in bullying situations. (C) 2015

"{Hypocrisy-professing a general attitude without implementing
corresponding attitude-relevant behavior-is, according to Ajzen and
Fishbein (2005), commonly found in attitude research that aims to
explain individual behavior. We conducted two studies that adopted the
Campbell paradigm, an alternative to the traditional understanding of
attitudes. In a laboratory experiment, we found that specific
attitude-relevant cooperation in a social dilemma was a function of
people's pre-existing general environmental attitude. In a
quasi-experiment, we corroborated the reverse as well; engagement in
attitude-relevant dietary practices was indicative of environmental
attitude. When using Campbellian attitude measures, there is no room for
hypocrisy: People put their general attitudes into specific
attitude-relevant practices, and differences in people's general
attitudes can be derived from their attitude-relevant behavior.}"
"{Cooperation among unrelated individuals can arise if decisions to help
others can be based on reputation. While working for dyadic
interactions, reputation-use in social dilemmas involving many
individuals (e.g. public goods games) becomes increasingly difficult as
groups become larger and errors more frequent. Reputation is therefore
believed to have played a minor role for the evolution of cooperation in
collective action dilemmas such as those faced by early humans. Here, we
show in computer simulations that a reputation system based on punitive
actions can overcome these problems and, compared to reputation system
based on generous actions, (i) is more likely to lead to the evolution
of cooperation in sizable groups, (ii) more effectively sustains
cooperation within larger groups, and (iii) is more robust to errors in
reputation assessment. Punishment and punishment reputation could
therefore have played crucial roles in the evolution of cooperation
within larger groups of humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

"{Individuals in a social dilemma may experience a self-control conflict
between urges to act selfishly and their better judgment to cooperate.
Pairing a public goods game with a subtle framing technique, we test
whether perception of self-control conflict strengthens the association
between self-control and cooperation. Consistent with our hypothesis,
cooperative behavior is positively associated with self-control in the
treatment that raised the relative likelihood of perceiving conflict,
but not associated with self-control in the treatment that lowered the
likelihood. These results indicate that it is important to understand
the role of self-control in cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

"{We examine how the timing of trust violations affects cooperation and
solidarity, including trust and relational cohesion. Past studies that
used repeated Prisoner's Dilemmas suggest that trust violations are more
harmful when they occur in early rather than later interactions. We
argue that this effect of early trust violations depends on cultural and
individual differences in generalized trust. A laboratory study from
high- and low-trust cultures (the United States vs. Japan) supported our
claim. First, early trust violations were more harmful than late trust
violations, but only for Americans; the pattern reversed for Japanese.
Second, these patterns were mediated by individual differences in
generalized trust. Finally, generalized trust also moderated the effect
of trust violations in the United States but not Japan. By demonstrating
that generalized trust is not only lower but also less important in
low-trust cultures, our research advances our understanding of how
culture affects the development of solidarity in exchange relations.}"
"{In two experiments, we investigated how priming European identity as
common project versus common heritage affects participants' cooperation
in a social dilemma; an additional aim was to explore the mediators
involved in the process. In the first experiment, 82 students played a
public good dilemma with a European bogus partner and then completed
self-report measures of identification with the European Union (EU),
group-based trust and collective interest. Results showed that priming a
common project-based but not a common heritage-based European social
identity fostered cooperative behaviour; this effect was mediated by two
sequential mediators: the common project prime increased participants'
strength of identification with EU (mediator 1) which, in turn,
positively affected group-based trust (mediator 2), fostering greater
cooperation. Experiment 2 was conducted with a similar procedure on a
sample of 124 students, using a different measure of trust and changing
the order of mediators. Results supported those of previous experiment:
Priming a project-based EU identity content (compared to heritage-based
one) had significant direct and indirect effects on cooperation.}"
"{This study explored the reasons and motives underlying the decisions of
individuals with strong Machiavellian attitudes (High Machs). One
hundred and fifty undergraduate students completed the Mach-IV test, and
their contributions to, financial success in and narrative reports of a
public goods game were analysed. High Machs contributed less to the
public good and gained more benefit than Low Machs. Analysis of the
narrative reports showed that High Machs used significantly fewer verbs
referring to emotional involvement and first person plural verb forms,
than did Low Machs. This study confirmed previous findings that High
Machs have a cool and rational character and a proself orientation and
showed that their lack of group orientation may account for their low
cooperation in social dilemmas. The results of narrative content
analysis provide a new perspective on the motives and values behind High
Machs' decisions and success in different fields of social life.}"
"{Sanction opportunities are often introduced to promote cooperative
choice behavior. Experimental studies have repeatedly demonstrated that
the use of both rewards and punishments can indeed effectively increase
cooperation. However, research has only recently begun to identify the
determinants of the willingness to sanction. We investigate the use of
costly sanctions to promote cooperation in the context of social
dilemmas. We argue and demonstrate that people's willingness to costly
reward and punish is not only determined by the type of sanction (reward
versus punishment) but is also moderated by the type of social dilemma
people face (public good dilemma versus common resource dilemma). In two
experiments, we demonstrate that people reward more and to a greater
extent than they punish, especially in a public good dilemma compared to
a common resource dilemma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Punishment is an important method for discouraging uncooperative
behavior. We use a novel design for a public goods game in which players
have explicit intended contributions with accidentally changed actual
contributions, and in which players can apply costly fines or ostracism.
Moreover, all players except the subject are automated, whereby we
control the intended contributions, actual contributions, costly fines,
and ostracisms experienced by the subject. We assess subject's
utilization of other players' intended and actual contributions when
making decisions to fine or ostracize. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic
regression provides robust estimates. We find that subjects emphasize
actual contribution more than intended contribution when deciding to
fine, but emphasize intended contribution more than actual contribution
when deciding to ostracize. We also find that the efficacy of past
punishment, in terms of changing the contributions of the punished
player, influences the type of punishment selected. Finally, we find
that the punishment norms of the automated players affect the
punishments performed by the subject. These novel paradigms and analyses
indicate that punishment is flexible and adaptive, contrary to some
evolutionary theories that predict inflexible punishments that emphasize
outcomes.}"
"{In social dilemmas, broad collective interests conflict with immediate
self-interests. In two studies, we examine the role of pride in guiding
cooperative behavior in a social dilemma. We find that the consideration
of pride led to more cooperation compared to the consideration of joy or
a control condition (Study 1) and compared to the consideration of
enjoyment (Study 2). The importance participants assigned to cooperation
mediated this effect of emotion on cooperation (Studies 1 and 3). We
suggest that because pride is linked to pro-social behavior, considering
pride activates the concept of pride which in turn makes related
behavioral representations more accessible and thus increases
cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Interventions to increase cooperation in social dilemmas depend on
understanding decision makers' motivations for cooperation or defection.
We examined these in five real-world social dilemmas: situations where
private interests are at odds with collective ones. An online survey (N
= 929) asked respondents whether or not they cooperated in each social
dilemma and then elicited both open-ended reports of reasons for their
choices and endorsements of a provided list of reasons. The dilemmas
chosen were ones that permit individual action rather than voting or
advocacy: (1) conserving energy, (2) donating blood, (3) getting a flu
vaccination, (4) donating to National Public Radio (NPR), and (5) buying
green electricity. Self-reported cooperation is weakly but positively
correlated across these dilemmas. Cooperation in each dilemma correlates
fairly strongly with self-reported altruism and with punitive attitudes
toward defectors. Some strong domain-specific behaviors and beliefs also
correlate with cooperation. The strongest example is frequency of
listening to NPR, which predicts donation. Socio-demographic variables
relate only weakly to cooperation. Respondents who self-report
cooperation usually cite social reasons (including reciprocity) for
their choice. Defectors often give self-interest reasons but there are
also some domain-specific reasons-some report that they are not eligible
to donate blood; some cannot buy green electricity because they do not
pay their own electric bills. Cooperators generally report that several
of the provided reasons match their actual reasons fairly well, but most
defectors endorse none or at most one of the provided reasons for
defection. In particular, defectors often view cooperation as costly but
do not endorse free riding as a reason for defection. We tentatively
conclude that cooperation in these settings is based mostly on
pro-social norms and defection on a mixture of self-interest and the
possibly motivated perception that situational circumstances prevent
cooperation in the given situation.}"
"{Although theory suggests individuals are more willing to incur a
personal cost to benefit ingroup members, compared to outgroup members,
there is inconsistent evidence in support of this perspective. Applying
meta-analytic techniques, we harness a relatively recent explosion of
research on intergroup discrimination in cooperative decision making to
address several fundamental unresolved issues. First, summarizing
evidence across studies, we find a small to medium effect size
indicating that people are more cooperative with ingroup, compared to
outgroup, members (d = 0.32). Second, we forward and test predictions
about the conditions that moderate ingroup favoritism from 2 influential
perspectives: a social identity approach and a bounded generalized
reciprocity perspective. Although we find evidence for a slight tendency
for ingroup favoritism through categorization with no mutual
interdependence between group members (e.g., dictator games; d = 0.19),
situations that contain interdependence result in stronger ingroup
favoritism (e.g., social dilemmas; d = 0.42). We also find that ingroup
favoritism is stronger when there is common (vs. unilateral) knowledge
of group membership, and stronger during simultaneous (vs. sequential)
exchanges. Third, we find support for the hypothesis that intergroup
discrimination in cooperation is the result of ingroup favoritism rather
than outgroup derogation. Finally, we test for additional moderators of
ingroup favoritism, such as the percentage of men in the sample,
experimental versus natural groups, and the country of participants. We
discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical perspectives
on ingroup favoritism, address implications for the methodologies used
to study this phenomenon, and suggest directions for future research.}"
"{Personality factors have been found to predict a variety of behaviors,
including cooperation, sharing, and strategic behaviors within
professional contexts. Specifically, individuals' preferences for self
vs. other outcomes (social value orientation) are predictive of
strategic sharing behaviors in mixed motive situations. For instance,
self-focused individuals tend to share fewer resources and maximize
their own outcomes. In this study, we examine a newly developed
personality measure, Give \& Take, which focuses on self vs. other
outcomes and evaluates individuals' primary interaction style (i.e.,
giver, matcher, or taker). We demonstrate that while Give \& Take
correlates with theoretically related constructs such as social value
orientation, narcissism, and reciprocity, it has unique predictive
validity for sharing behavior. Specifically, when examining Give \& Take
simultaneously with social value orientation, we found that Give \& Take
predicted sharing in both a public goods dilemma task and a strategic
information-sharing task above and beyond social value orientation. In
general, takers contributed fewer resources to a public good and also
shared less information, especially important information, with others.
Findings suggest that this new measure may be useful for explaining
interpersonal dynamics, particularly within professional contexts. (C)

"{This research investigates which endocrinological and psychological
factors are associated with individuals' tendency to engage in
destructive antisocial punishment, that is, to costly punish cooperative
individuals in public goods situations. In this work, we focus on the
interplay of endogenous cortisol with testosterone and dominance. We
applied the dual-hormone hypothesis according to which testosterone is
positively associated with destructive and dominant behavior but only in
individuals with low levels of cortisol. Study 1 shows that individuals
are more likely to engage in destructive antisocial punishment in a
public goods game with the option to punish when their testosterone
level is high, given that their level of cortisol is low, which bolsters
the dual-hormone hypothesis. In contrast, no significant interaction
effect of testosterone and cortisol emerges for the punishment of
uncooperative free-riders (altruistic punishment). In a second study, we
build on these findings and document that self-reported dominance is
only positively associated with antisocial punishment (but not with
altruistic punishment) when cortisol is low. In sum, the results
indicate the importance of taking endocrinological and psychological
factors (and their interactions) into account in order to reach a
comprehensive understanding of individuals' behavior in social dilemma
situations. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}"
"{Previous studies independently showed that acute treatment with a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) enhanced happy face
recognition, and dominance behaviors which might reflect enhancement of
reward sensitivity. The present study aimed to determine whether such a
mechanism would be related to social resource acquisition induced by an
SSRI. Forty healthy subjects were recruited for the experiment. A
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover nested within
confederate type (happy, fearful, or sad) trial of a single-dose of 10
mg escitalopram versus placebo was conducted with a two-week washout
period. In each of the treatment groups, the subjects interacted
socially with one of the three types of confederate in a waiting room
for 3-minute. Then, they went to an individual laboratory and were led
to believe that they played the Mixed-motive game with the confederate.
The game measures punitive/cooperative behaviors by how participants
allocate higher/lower game scores to the confederate and communicate
cooperation/ingratiation/helplessness/sadness/blaming/extrapunitive,
messages to the confederate. Significant treatment-by-confederate type
interactions were observed through game score distributions and
ingratiation messages to the confederate and attentive eye gaze. In the
happy confederate condition, escitalopram increased ingratiation
messages and lowered points awarded to the confederate. In the fearful
confederate condition, escitalopram increased ingratiation messages and
reduced time spent looking away from the confederate. No changes in
these measures were found in the sad confederate condition. Therefore
acute escitalopram treatment enhances reward sensitivity to the facial
emotions of social partners which in turn increases social resource
acquisition and social dominance towards happy but not fearful social
partners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.}"
"{In empirical analyses of games, preferences and beliefs are typically
treated as independent. However, if beliefs and preferences interact,
this may have implications for the interpretation of observed behavior.
Our sequential social dilemma experiment allows us to separate different
interaction channels. When subjects play both roles in such experiments,
a positive correlation between first- and second-mover behavior is
frequently reported. We find that the observed correlation primarily
originates via an indirect channel, where second-mover decisions
influence beliefs through a consensus effect, and the first-mover
decision is a best response to these beliefs. Specifically, beliefs
about second-mover cooperation are biased toward own second-mover
behavior, and most subjects best respond to stated beliefs. However, we
also find evidence for a direct, preference-based channel. When first
movers know the true probability of second-mover cooperation, subjects'
own second moves still have predictive power regarding their first
moves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{It is known that presentation of a meaningful label (e. g., ``The
Teamwork Game{''}) can influence decisions in economic games. A common
view is that such labels cue associations to preexisting mental models
of situations, a process here called frame selection. In the absence of
such cues, participants may still spontaneously associate a game with a
preexisting frame. We used the public goods game to compare the effect
of such spontaneous frame selection with the effect of label framing.
Participants in a condition where the public goods game was labeled
``The Teamwork Game{''} tended to contribute at the same level as
participants who spontaneously associated the unlabeled game with
teamwork, whereas those who did not associate the the unlabeled game
with teamwork tended to make lower contributions. We conclude that
neutrally described games may be subject to spontaneous frame selection
effects comparable in size to the effects of label framing.}"
"{Many experiments comparing individual and group behavior find that
groups behave more egoistically than individuals. However, most of these
studies do not control for the influence of within-group decision-making
rules that might have an important impact on group behavior. In this
article, we report findings from laboratory experiments comparing
individual and group behavior in a public goods game. We find that
rather than cooperation levels differing between individuals and groups
per se, the intragroup decision-making rule has an influence on the
cooperativeness of groups. Groups decide either by majority or unanimity
rule. While groups deciding by majority rule reach roughly the same
level of cooperation as individuals, groups deciding by unanimity rule
contribute significantly lower amounts to the public good.}"
"{In this article we provide empirical support for anger as an underlying
mechanism of costly punishment in three studies. A first study showed
that participants punished other players more the less these players
cooperated in a Public Goods Game and that this effect was mediated by
experienced anger. A second study showed that participants appraised
non-cooperation in a Sequential Trust Game (STG) as more unfair than
cooperation and that they imposed more costly punishment on unfair
others as compared to fair others. The effect of appraised unfairness on
imposed punishment was mediated by anger. Moreover, a third study showed
that following an anger induction in an unrelated task, participants
imposed more costly punishment on unfair players in a subsequent STG.}"
"{Despite the benefits of cooperation, selfish individuals often produce

"We conduct a framed field experiment in two Dallas neighborhoods to examine how common identity affects individual contributions to local public goods. The participants’ common identity is primed to make neighborhood membership salient before individuals make donations to local non-profit organizations. We find that the identity treatment is sensitive to community context. It decreases the likelihood of giving in the struggling, poor neighborhood, but its impact is positive, albeit statistically insignificant, in the low- to middle-income neighborhood. In addition, the identity treatment triggers participants’ perceptions or memories of experiences with their communities which in turn lead to the treatment differences across the two communities. Our findings reveal the limitations on the power of common group identity in influencing individual economic decision making, which has been largely overlooked in the literature.

"Research on collective action problems and the provision of public goods has yielded an array of important insights into why people sacrifice for their groups, but ignores the processes that bring people into those groups in the first place. The literature is also silent on the fact that groups providing similar public goods often compete with one another to attract new members. We extend the reach of theories of collective action problems to bring them to bear on these interrelated issues. Results from four experiments support our predictions about when group members compete to attract new adherents by sacrificing more for group goals. Further, we find that prospective members join more productive groups at much higher rates and then contribute to them at high levels. These processes give way to cumulative advantage, whereby initially productive groups continually attract new members. Thus competition for members can yield large inequalities in the size and success of collective action groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In cooperative endeavors among economically heterogeneous parties, the contribution decisions can often be framed in different ways. But do such framing differences affect behavior? We report the results of a laboratory experiment on threshold public goods with heterogeneous endowments and different frames. Four treatments frame two variables, each in one of two ways: the contribution metric is expressed either in absolute terms or relative to endowments, and the contribution choice is framed as either keeping or contributing some of one’s endowment. Subjects can exchange proposals and counterproposals. Our results reveal a broad consensus that high endowed subjects contribute more in absolute terms than the low endowed, which we trace to subjects’ reported distributive preferences. Both high and low endowed subjects contribute about two-thirds of their endowments in all treatments—Save when the metric is framed as 'contributing' in 'absolute' terms: then the low endowed contribute significantly more, around 80%. This last result suggests the possibility that the most frequently used frame in public good experiments induces higher contributions among the less affluent than economically equivalent alternate frames.

"This research asks whether and how institutional trust—trust in the reliability, effectiveness, and legitimacy of public institutions—promotes the provision of public goods. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we apply three choice models to the example of recycling behavior: a standard rational choice model, the low-cost hypothesis, and a dual-process theory. The models carry competing hypotheses about the interplay of trust and incentives in recycling behavior. Using survey data collected in four countries (Sweden, Denmark, the United States, and the United Kingdom), we find a positive and significant interaction effect of institutional trust and recycling costs on self-reported recycling behavior. No such interaction was found using generalized social trust as a second measure of trust. Our results support a dual-process perspective and indicate that high levels of institutional trust can suppress the inhibiting effect of individual costs on cooperation in a collective action dilemma.

"What happens when charities compete? We begin to answer this question through a laboratory experiment in which subjects play two public goods games simultaneously. We systematically vary the incentives for contributing in one of the games—investigating the effects of recognition, a bonus conditional on contributing, and non-monetary sanctions—and measure the effect on contributions in both games. Monetary incentives in the form of conditional bonuses increase contributions, even when two games are played simultaneously. However, non-monetary incentives such as recognition and sanctions are less effective than in related literature on games played in isolation. Moreover, we find mixed evidence of a treatment spillover on the un-treated games—bonuses increase contributions initially, recognition decreases contributions, and sanctions have no effect.

"In a public-good experiment with heterogeneous endowments, we investigate if and how the contribution level as well as the previously observed 'fair-share' rule of equal contributions relative to one’s endowment (Hofmeyr et al., 2007; Keser et al., 2014) are influenced by minimum-contribution requirements. We consider three different schedules: FixMin, requiring the same absolute contributions, RelMin, requiring the same relative contributions, and ProgMin, requiring minimum contributions that progressively increase with the endowment. We find that minimum contributions exert norm-giving character and may lead to an increase in average group contributions. This is especially true for the progressive schedule. On the individual level, this schedule leads to higher relative contributions by the wealthier players and thus violates the 'fair-share' norm. On the group level, it leads to the highest contribution level and the lowest inequality in total profits as measured by the Gini index. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This paper uses a Bayesian mechanism design approach to investigate the effects of communication in a threshold public goods game. Individuals have private information about contribution costs. Individuals can each make a discrete contribution. If the number of contributors is at least equal to the threshold, a public benefit accrues to all members of the group. We experimentally implement three different communication structures prior to the decision move: (a) simultaneous exchange of binary messages, (b) larger finite numerical message space and (c) unrestricted text chat. We obtain theoretical bounds on the efficiency gains that are obtainable under these different communication structures. In an experiment with three person groups and a threshold of two, we observe significant efficiency gains only with the richest of these communication structures, where participants engage in unrestricted text chatting. In that case, the efficiency bounds implied by mechanism design theory are achieved. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We argue that since allocation mechanisms will not always be in equilibrium, their out-of-equilibrium properties must be taken into account along with their properties in equilibrium. For economies with public goods, we define a simple market-like mechanism in which the strong Nash equilibria yield the Lindahl allocations and prices. The mechanism satisfies critical out-of-equilibrium desiderata that previously-introduced mechanisms fail to satisfy, and always (weakly) yields Pareto improvements, whether in equilibrium or not. The mechanism requires participants to communicate prices and quantities, and turns these into outcomes according to a natural and intuitive outcome function. Our approach first exploits the equivalence, when there are only two participants, between the private-good and public-good allocation problems to obtain a two-person public-good mechanism, and then we generalize the public-good mechanism to an arbitrary number of participants. The results and the intuition behind them are illustrated in the familiar Edgeworth Box and Kölm Triangle diagrams. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Impure public goods combine a private good with a public good. Often, impure public goods have a charitable or ethical dimension, giving ethically motivated consumers a convenient option to contribute to public goods through the marketplace (in addition to direct donations). Impure public goods could potentially promote ethical giving or alternatively hinder charitable behaviour. We implement an economics experiment with a between-subject design to test the behavioural relevance of impure public goods with only a token (i.e. small) contribution to a public good. Contributions to the public good are negatively affected by the presence of impure public goods with token contributions. We explore one mechanism to offset this negative impact by making the token impure public good mandatory. We observe higher average contributions and several positive impacts on charitable behaviour, which supports the claim that this mechanism can potentially offset the negative impact of impure public goods.

"In public goods situations, a specific destructive behavior emerges when individuals face the possibility of punishing others: antisocial punishment, that is, costly punishing cooperative individuals. So far, little is known about the (intuitive or reflective) processes underlying antisocial punishment. Building on the Social Heuristics Hypothesis and arguing that antisocial punishment reflects the basic characteristics of sadism, namely, aggressive behavior to dominate and to harm other individuals it is assumed that everyday sadists intuitively engage in antisocial punishment. Two studies document that activating (Study 1) and inhibiting (Study 2) the intuitive system when a punishment option can be realized in one-shot iterated public goods games increased (Study 1) and reduced (Study 2) antisocial punishment, in particular among individuals who reported a proneness to sadism. In sum, the present research suggests that sadistic tendencies executed intuitively play a crucial role regarding antisocial punishment in public goods situations.

"The recent introduction of inexpensive eyetrackers has opened up a wealth of opportunities for researchers to study attention in interactive tasks. No software package has previously been available to help researchers exploit those opportunities. We created 'the pyeTribe,' a software package that offers, among others, the following features: first, a communication platform between many eyetrackers to allow for simultaneous recording of multiple participants; second, the simultaneous calibration of multiple eyetrackers without the experimenter’s supervision; third, data collection restricted to periods of interest, thus reducing the volume of data and easing analysis. We used a standard economic game (the public goods game) to examine the data quality and demonstrate the potential of our software package. Moreover, we conducted a modeling analysis, which illustrates how combining process and behavioral data can improve models of human decision-making behavior in social situations. Our software is open source. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We study the impact of revealing personal information on the selection of partners when forming individual networks. In our experiment, a 'contribution phase' is followed by a 'network phase': individuals first decide whether to contribute and then decide with whom to form a link. An exchange of contributions between individuals occurs only if a bilateral link is established. We identify the effect of revealing one's name on the probability of link formation by letting individuals choose to signal—at the linking stage—their willingness to later reveal their name. Our results indicate that this decision significantly affects partner selection and the consequent structure of the network. Individuals who reveal their name build up smaller individual networks but attain higher profits. Incurring privacy costs by revealing personal information is compensated with a higher probability to establish mutual links with contributors.

"In this study we conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with low-income Hispanics in three neighborhoods in a large city in the U.S. to investigate how identity and social exclusion influences individual contributions to fund local public goods. We find that while the strength of identity has a significant and positive impact on individual contributions to local public goods, the perception of social exclusion significantly decreases contributions. Our findings thus suggest factors that may impede full civic participation, and shed important light on potential policies to increase integration of immigrants and ethnic minorities into mainstream society.

"Microfinance groups often engage in a variety of collective activities not directly related to credit. We design a three-stage repayment game to examine how the existence of these ancillary activities affect repayment behavior and group attrition. In the first stage, the group borrows under joint liability, each member undertakes a risky project and decides whether or not to contribute to loan repayment. In the second stage, contributing members can vote to expel others from the group. Those remaining engage in a public goods game in the last stage. The public good game represents the non-credit collective activity that members can be involved in. We identify repayment equilibria with and without exclusion and show that exclusionary equilibria are most likely when loans are large and there is significant within-group heterogeneity in the gains from the public good. Results from a laboratory experiment that embodies the main features of the repayment game are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Individual decisions to contribute to loan repayment depend on gains from the public good and groups with the largest debt burdens have the highest rates of default and attrition.

"The provision point mechanism as a method of funding threshold public goods is extended with refund bonuses. Each contributor not only has his contribution refunded in the case of insufficient contributions but also receives a refund bonus proportional to his proposed contribution. As long as the refund bonus pool does not exceed the net value of the public good, in equilibrium the public good is always provided and refund bonuses are never distributed. In this paper, we empirically investigate this extension of the provision point mechanism in a laboratory experiment by testing its properties on allocative and distributive efficiency, equilibrium coordination, and invariance to information distribution. Individuals respond to the incentives induced by refund bonuses as predicted, but systematic deviations exist that are consistent with quantal response equilibrium. Since this simple mechanism has considerable practical potential especially in crowdfunding, these promising initial results call for further experimental work.

"A basic goal in mechanism design is to construct mechanisms that simultaneously satisfy efficiency, voluntary participation, and dominant strategy incentive compatibility. Previous work has shown that this is impossible, unless the agents and planner have sufficient information about each other and common knowledge. These results have remained largely theoretical because the required information is generally not available in practical applications. However, recent work has shown that these limitations can be overcome in simple settings, using neurometric technologies that provide noisy signals of subjects’ preferences that can be used in the mechanism design problem. Here we build on this work by carrying out two new experiments designed to test the extent to which these Neurometrically Informed Mechanisms (NIMs) can be applied to more complicated and realistic environments. We find robustness to large type and action space and to the degrees of loss and risk-aversion observed in most of our sample. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{Previous research has reported conflicting results on whether and the
extent to which individuals play equilibria of experimental games. Two
experiments reported in this paper ask whether the act of eliciting

playing an equilibrium in a social dilemma or public goods game. The
first experiment compares two versions of a linear public goods game,
one with and one without an elicitation of beliefs. Contributions in the
two treatments were significantly different, with the actions of
subjects in the elicitation treatment closer to the equilibrium
prediction of full free riding. A second experiment investigates the

subjects in the elicitation treatment play the dominant strategy

"{Interpersonal trust has long been known to influence cooperation. This
study tested the hypothesis that one's degree of trust in others will
influence the extent to which one reacts to the presence of fear (or the
possibility of receiving no payoff for cooperative actions) in a payoff
matrix. The hypothesis was formally tested with public goods games and
resource dilemma games, with fear manipulated. Results support the
hypothesis: when fear was present, high trusters cooperated more
frequently than low trusters; when absent, high and low trusters
cooperated at the same rate. The findings held across both games.
However, the effects of fear within each game were not straightforward:
removing fear from the resource dilemma increased low trusters'
cooperation rates, but removing fear from the public goods game
decreased high trusters' cooperation rates. Results imply that
discussion of the role of trust in cooperation must consider whether the
particular dilemma contains an element of fear.}"
"{Explaining unconditional cooperation, such as donations to charities or
contributions to public goods, continues to present a problem. One
possibility is that cooperation can pay through developing a reputation
that makes one more likely to be chosen for a profitable cooperative
partnership, a process termed competitive altruism (CA) or
reputation-based partner choice. Here, we show, to our knowledge, for
the first time, that investing in a cooperative reputation can bring net
benefits through access to more cooperative partners. Participants
played a public goods game (PGG) followed by an opportunity to select a
partner for a second cooperative game. We found that those who gave more
in the PGG were more often selected as desired partners and received
more in the paired cooperative game. Reputational competition was even
stronger when it was possible for participants to receive a higher
payoff from partner choice. The benefits of being selected by a more
cooperative partner outweighed the costs of cooperation in the
reputation building phase. CA therefore provides an alternative to
indirect reciprocity as an explanation for reputation-building
behaviour. Furthermore, while indirect reciprocity depends upon
individuals giving preference to those of good standing, CA can explain
unconditional cooperation.}"
"{Understanding the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that favour
cooperation remains one of the greatest challenges in the biological and
social sciences. A number of theoretical studies have suggested that
competition between groups may have played a key role in the evolution
of cooperation within human societies, and similar ideas have been
discussed for other organisms, especially cooperative breeding
vertebrates. However, there is a relative lack of empirical work testing
these ideas. Our experiment found, in public goods games with humans,
that when groups competed with other groups for financial rewards,
individuals made larger contributions within their own groups. In such
situations, participants were more likely to regard their group mates as
collaborators rather than competitors. Variation in contribution among
individuals, either with or without intergroup competition, was
positively correlated with individuals' propensity to regard group mates
as collaborators. We found that the levels of both guilt and anger
individuals experienced were a function of their own contributions and
those of their group mates. Overall, our results arc consistent with the
idea that the level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate
emotions, which vary with the degree of intergroup competition. (C) 2010

"{Introducing a threshold in the sense of a minimal project size
transforms a public-good game with an inefficient equilibrium into a
coordination game with a set of Pareto-superior equilibria. Thresholds
may therefore improve efficiency in the voluntary provision of public
goods. In our one-shot experiment, we find that coordination often fails
and exogenously imposed thresholds are ineffective at best and often
counterproductive. This holds over a range of threshold levels and
refund rates. We test whether thresholds perform better if they are
endogenously chosen, i.e., whether a threshold is approved in a
referendum, because voting may facilitate coordination due to signaling
and commitment effects. We find that voting does have signaling and
commitment effects, but they are not strong enough to significantly
improve the efficiency of thresholds.}"

"{It is hypothesized that allowing taxpayers to participate in
governmental decisions on the use of tax money would increase their
cooperation and willingness to pay the tax due. In experiment 1 (N =
97), participants voted between different rules for a public good game

Cooperation in experiment 2 (N = 119) was defined as the participants'
tax payments. The participants were allowed to vote on the use of their
tax money. Additionally to the voting manipulation, the participants
learned that either they themselves or others would benefit from
tax-financed projects. The results from both experiments suggest that
voting, i.e., participation, increases cooperation. Whether participants
benefited themselves from tax-financed projects or whether others
benefited from the projects did matter for participants' tax compliance.
Furthermore, the results indicate that more procedural fairness was
perceived when allowing for voting and that participants' trust in the
governmental system mediates the relation of procedural fairness and tax
payments.}"
"{People differ in how injustice-sensitive they are either as victims or
as observers. Whereas observer sensitivity is positively related to
cooperative behavior, victim sensitivity promotes antisocial and
egoistic behavior. The present article investigates the dynamics
underlying these effects. Participants played an online-based public
goods game and were informed about the number of people who violated a
fairness rule in previous rounds of the game (no, some, or many
violators). High victim-sensitive participants contributed less to the
public good even in the ``some violators{''} condition. High
observer-sensitive participants contributed more to the public good even
in the ``many violators{''} condition. The findings correspond with the
sensitivity to mean intentions model and cannot be explained by
individual differences in general trust. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

"{The public goods game is the classic laboratory paradigm for studying
collective action problems. Each participant chooses how much to
contribute to a common pool that returns benefits to all participants
equally. The ideal outcome occurs if everybody contributes the maximum
amount, but the self-interested strategy is not to contribute anything.
Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than
reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical
design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for
today's actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods
games followed by punishment, reward, or both in the setting of truly
repeated games, in which player identities persist from round to round.
We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public
cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both
options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and
payoff, whereas punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to
lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated
public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings
is best supported by positive interactions with others.}"
"{Sanctioning institutions are of utmost importance for overcoming

a subset of players. The experiment confirms that institutions are
formed and that it positively affects cooperation and group welfare.
However, the data also shows that success is not guaranteed. Players are
unwilling to implement equilibrium institutions in which some players
have the opportunity to free ride. Our results emphasize the role of
fairness in the institution formation process. (JEL C72, D02, H41)}"

recover the set of norms used most often by monitors and show first that
the decision to punish should be modeled separately from the decision of
how much to punish. Second, we show that absolute norms often fit the

autonomous individual punishment; (2) similar cooperation levels under

"{A popular approach to explain over-contribution in public good games is
based on the assumption that people care (either positively or
negatively) about the utility of other participants. Over-contribution
then is an outcome of utility maximization where utility depends on
subjects' own payoffs as well as on the payoffs of other players. In
this paper, I study to what extent this assumption of utility
interdependence is responsible for over-contribution. I design three
treatments where subjects' decisions cannot affect opponents' payoffs
and thus utility interdependence cannot explain cooperative behavior.
The main result is that while average contribution in these treatments
is below the benchmark it nonetheless stays well above zero. Even when
no one benefits from subjects' generosity the average contributions are
as high as one third of the endowment and are only 25\% below those in
the benchmark level. This suggests that utility interdependence is not
the main factor responsible for over-contribution.}"
"{Much of human cooperation remains an evolutionary riddle. Unlike other
animals, people frequently cooperate with non-relatives in large groups.
Evolutionary models of large-scale cooperation require not just
incentives for cooperation, but also a credible disincentive for free
riding. Various theoretical solutions have been proposed and
experimentally explored, including reputation monitoring and diffuse
punishment. Here, we empirically examine an alternative theoretical
proposal: responsibility for punishment can be borne by one specific
individual. This experiment shows that allowing a single individual to
punish increases cooperation to the same level as allowing each group
member to punish and results in greater group profits. These results
suggest a potential key function of leadership in human groups and
provides further evidence supporting that humans will readily and
knowingly behave altruistically.}"

how in payoff-equivalent situations, decision makers contribute toward
private or public goods when they are exposed to different kinds of
risks and uncertainties in the provision of these goods. We find that
location matters with subjects moving away from the environmental
uncertainty in favor of strategic uncertainty when that uncertainty is
located on the private good. When the uncertainty relates to the public
good, subjects face both kinds of uncertainties on the same good,
leading to a significant drop in contributions. An opportunity to reduce
uncertainty increases cooperation. (JEL C90, D81, H41).}"
"{A human social discount function measures the value to a person of a

initial \$100 endowment they would contribute to a common investment in
a public good. Steepness of discounting correlated, across participants,

contribution; high public-good contributors were more altruistic and
also less risk averse than low contributors. Experiment 2 obtained

for the behavioral aspect, it emerges that intra- and inter-group

"{Cooperation among nonrelatives can be puzzling because cooperation often
involves incurring costs to confer benefits on unrelated others.
Punishment of noncooperators can sustain otherwise fragile cooperation,
but the provision of punishment suffers from a ``second-order{''}
free-riding problem because nonpunishers can free ride on the benefits
from costly punishment provided by others. One suggested solution to
this problem is second-order punishment of nonpunishers; more generally,
the threat or promise of higher order sanctions might maintain the lower
order sanctions that enforce cooperation in collective action problems.
Here the authors report on 3 experiments testing people's willingness to
provide second-order sanctions by having participants play a cooperative
game with opportunities to punish and reward each other. The authors
found that people supported those who rewarded cooperators either by
rewarding them or by punishing nonrewarders, but people did not support
those who punished noncooperators-they did not reward punishers or
punish nonpunishers. Furthermore, people did not approve of punishers
more than they did nonpunishers, even when nonpunishers were clearly
unwilling to use sanctions to support cooperation. The results suggest
that people will much more readily support positive sanctions than they
will support negative sanctions.}"
"{This paper reports the results of an experiment that investigates the
two-sided relationship between punishment and welfare. First, it
contributes to the literature on the behavioral determinants of
punishment by examining the role of relative income and income
comparisons as a determinant of punishment in a two-stage public good
game when inequality arises endogenously from the subjects' behavior.
Second, this paper investigates the impact of punishment on both
absolute and relative incomes. We compare three treatments of our game.
The Unequal Cost treatment replicates Fehr and Gachter (2000)'s
experiment under a stranger matching protocol. The Equal Cost treatment
is identical to the previous one except that the ratio between the cost
of one punishment point to the punisher and its cost to the target
equals one. The third treatment is similar to the second one except that
a partner matching protocol is implemented in order to isolate strategic
motives for punishment. Our results indicate that subjects punish even
when they cannot alter the current distribution of payoffs. We also find
that in all treatments, the intensity of punishment increases in the
level of inter-individual inequality. Finally, despite its cost,
punishment progressively improves welfare in association with a decrease
in the aggregate level of inequality over time.}"
"{Laws express rules of conduct ('obligations') enforced by the means of
penalties and rewards ('incentives'). The role of incentives in shaping
individual behaviour has been largely analysed in the traditional
economic literature. On the contrary, very little is known about the
specific role of obligations. In this paper we test whether or not
obligations have any independent effect on cooperation in a public good
game. The results show that. for given marginal incentives, different
levels of minimum contribution required by obligation determine
significantly different levels of average contributions. Moreover.
obligations per se cannot sustain cooperation over time, even if they
affect the rate of decline of average contributions. Finally. unexpected
changes in the minimum contribution have asymmetric dynamic effects on
the levels of cooperation: a reduction does not alter the descending
trend of cooperation. whereas an increase induces a temporary re-start
in average contributions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{This experiment investigated potential gender biases in the emergence of
leadership in groups. Teams played a public-goods game under conditions

leaders during intergroup competition. Furthermore, during intragroup
competition, a female leader was more instrumental than a male leader in
raising group investments, but this pattern was reversed during
intergroup competition. These findings suggest that particular group
threats elicit specific gender-biased leader prototypes. We speculate
about the evolutionary and cultural origins of these sex differences in

"{A number of experimental studies have shown that the opportunity to
punish anti-social behavior increases cooperation levels when agents
face a social dilemma. Using a public good experiment, I show that in
the presence of counter-punishment opportunities cooperators are less
willing to punish free riders. As a result, cooperation breaks down and
groups have lower earnings in comparison to a treatment without
punishments where free riding is predominant. Approximately one quarter
of all punishments are retaliated. Counter-punishments appear to be
driven partly by strategic considerations and partly by a desire to
reciprocate punishments. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Reciprocal altruism involves foregoing an immediate benefit for the sake
of a greater long-term reward. It follows that individuals who exhibit a
stronger preference for future over immediate rewards should be more
disposed to engage in reciprocal altruism - in other words, `patient'

prediction by investigating whether participants' contributions in a
public-good game correlated with their `discount rate'. The hypothesis
was supported: patient people are indeed more cooperative. The paper

"{Questions remain about the details of the reciprocal strategies people

have clear preferences for particular pieces of information and that
information preferences vary systematically across individuals as a
function of their contribution strategies. Specifically, participants
playing reciprocal strategies sought information about the median
contribution, free riders preferred to view the highest contribution,
and altruists had inconsistent preferences. By including a treatment in
which people could pay to see information rather than obtaining it for
free, we found that people were willing to incur costs to acquire
information, particularly those using a reciprocal strategy. Further
adding a cost to view information decreased aggregate contributions,
possibly because the motivation to induce others' reciprocal
contributions diminished under these conditions. Copyright (c) 2007 John

behavior in linear public good games with summation contribution

nothing) and social optimal behavior (everybody gives the entire

"{We experimentally investigate the effect of intergroup competition -

"{Theories of commitment, altruism, and reciprocity have been invoked to
explain and describe behavior in public goods and social dilemma
situations. Commitment has been used to explain behaviors like water
conservation and voting. Altruism has been applied to explain
contributions to charities and intergenerational transfers and bequests.
Reciprocity has been invoked to explain gift exchange and labor market
decisions. This paper describes a set of experiments, which distinguish
between these competing theories by testing their comparative statics
predictions in a linear public goods setting. Results provide strong
support for reciprocity theories over either theories of commitment or
of altruism.}"
"{To investigate the effects of gender and national culture on economic
behavior, we compare all-male and all-female groups from Japan and
Canada in the context of a threshold public goods game with a strong
free-riding equilibrium and many socially efficient threshold
equilibria. Females and Canadians exhibit higher levels of conformity
when compared with males and Japanese, respectively. However, such
symmetric group behavior translates into significantly tighter
equilibrium convergence only for Canadian females. Canadians,
particularly Canadian females, are more successful at providing the
public good than Japanese. The results suggest that the prevalence of
different notions of self-construal may affect behavior. (c) 2006

"{This is a study about the possibility of self-governance. We designed
two versions of a step-level public good game, with or without a
centralized sanctioning mechanism (CSM). In a baseline treatment
participants play 14 rounds of the non-CSM game. In an automatic removal
(AR) treatment participants play 7 rounds with CSM plus 7 rounds without
CSM. In voted removal (VR) participants play 7 rounds with CSM followed
by a voting stage to decide whether to keep CSM. All VR groups removed
CSM. Contributions in AR and VR after CSM removal are dramatically
higher than in the baseline. Most groups with a CSM history managed to
cooperate until the last round. We do not find more cooperation in VR
than in AR.}"
"{Many studies show that people act cooperatively and are willing to
punish free riders (i.e., people who are less cooperative than others).
However, nonpunishers benefit when free riders are punished, making
punishment a group-beneficial act. Presented here are four studies
investigating whether punishers gain social benefits from punishing.
Undergraduate participants played public goods games (PGGs) (cooperative
group games involving money) in which there were free riders, and in
which they were given the opportunity to impose monetary penalties on
free riders. Participants rated punishers as being more trustworthy,
group focused, and worthy of respect than nonpunishers. In dyadic trust
games following PGGs, punishers did not receive monetary benefits from
punishing free riders in a single-round PGG, but did benefit monetarily
from punishing free riders in iterated PGGs. Punishment that was not
directed at free riders brought no monetary benefits, suggesting that
people distinguish between justified and unjustified punishment and only
respond to punishment with enhanced trust when the punishment is
justified. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Maintaining the Earth's climate within habitable boundaries is probably
the greatest ``public goods game{''} played by humans. However,with > 6
billion ``players{''} taking part, the game seems to rule out individual
altruistic behavior. Thus, climate protection is a problem of sustaining
a public resource that everybody is free to overuse, a ``tragedy of the
commons{''} problem that emerges in many social dilemmas. We perform a
previously undescribed type of public goods experiment with human
subjects contributing to a public pool. In contrast to the standard
protocol, here the common pool is not divided among the participants;
instead, it is promised that the pool will be invested to encourage
people to reduce their fossil fuel use. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that players can behave altruistically to maintain the
Earth's climate given the right set of circumstances. We find a nonzero
basic level of altruistic behavior, which is enhanced if the players are
provided with expert information describing the state of knowledge in
climate research. Furthermore, personal investments in climate
protection increase substantially if players can invest publicly, thus
gaining social reputation. This increase occurs because subjects reward
other subjects' contributions to sustaining the climate, thus
reinforcing their altruism. Therefore, altruism may convert to net
personal benefit and to relaxing the dilemma if the gain in reputation
is large enough. Our finding that people reward contributions to
sustaining the climate of others is a surprising result. There are
obvious ways these unexpected findings can be applied on a large scale.}"
"{We studied repeated choices under uncertainty in situations in which the
source of uncertainty is the choice of an interaction partner. In 1
experiment the participants engaged in repeated decisions in a mixed
motive game; in another experiment the options and outcomes were
identical to those in the 1st, but periods of the mixed-motive game
alternated with periods of a coordination game, with the change in
period not announced. We analyzed choice dynamics-the relationship
between an outcome and the choice that followed-and aggregate choice
probabilities to gauge the relative merit of reward-based or
affect-based accounts (the affects considered being disappointment and
regret). In both experiments choice dynamics were essentially identical
and were compatible with only the regret-based account. This was true
irrespective of the game played or the stage (early or late) of the
game. Moreover, the same dynamics explained the very different aggregate
probabilities with which the 2 options were chosen in the 2 games and
the remarkably fast adaptations to unannounced changes in the game
played.}"
"{Several studies tested whether partner-focused prayer shifts individuals
toward cooperative tendencies and forgiveness. In Studies 1 and 2,
participants who prayed more frequently for their partner were rated by
objective coders as less vengeful. Study 3 showed that, compared to
partners of targets in the positive partner thought condition, the
romantic partners of targets assigned to pray reported a positive change
in their partner's forgiveness. In Study 4, participants who prayed
following a partner's hurtful behavior were more cooperative with their
partners in a mixed-motive game compared to participants who engaged in
positive thoughts about their partner. In Study 5, participants who
prayed for a close relationship partner reported higher levels of
cooperative tendencies and forgiveness.}"
"{Background: Patients with schizophrenia consistently show deficits in
facial affect perception and social behaviours. It is illusive to
suggest that these deficits in facial affect perception cause poor
social behaviours.
Aim: The present research aims to study how facial affects influence
ingratiation, cooperation and punishment behaviours of the patients.
Methods: Forty outpatients with paranoid schizophrenia, 26 matched
depressed patients and 46 healthy volunteers were recruited. After
measurement of clinical symptoms and depression, their facial emotion
recognition, neurocognitive functioning and the facial affects dependent
cooperative behaviour were measured using a modified version of
Mixed-Motive Game.
Results: The depressed control group showed demographic characteristics,
depression levels and neurocognitive functioning similar to the
schizophrenic group. Patients with schizophrenia committed significantly
more errors in neutral face identification than the other two groups.
They were significantly more punitive on the Mixed-Motive Game in the
neutral face condition.
Conclusion: Neutral face misidentification was a unique
emotion-processing deficit in the schizophrenic group. Their increase in
punitive behaviours in the neutral face condition might confuse their
family members and trigger more expressed emotion from them, thus
increasing the risk of relapse. Family members might display more happy
faces to promote positive relationships with patients.}"
"{The syntactic organization of incidentally presented word pairs may
affect behavior by providing actors with implicit propositions about how
to behave. In Experiment 1, participants who had already played turns of
a mixed-motive game were less cooperative after an explicit
propositional suggestion that they had been nice in prior turns but were
more cooperative after the suggestion that they should be nice in
upcoming turns. In three subsequent experiments, implicit priming with
the phrase nice act produced greater levels of defection, implying that
actors responded to the implicit suggestion that they had been
sufficiently nice already. In contrast, act nice produced greater levels
of cooperation, implying that actors responded to the implicit
suggestion that they should try to be nicer in upcoming turns. These
effects occurred outside of awareness and disappeared when the interval
between the words was long and when behavior was measured after a delay.}"
"{Prior experimental studies provide evidence that the levels of trust and
reciprocity are highly susceptible to individuals' preferences towards
payoffs, prior experience, capacity to learn more about personal
characteristics of each other and social distance. The objective of this
study is to examine whether social value orientation as developed by
Griesinger and Livingston {[}Griesinger, D. W., \& Livingston Jr., J.W.

account for the variability of trust and trustworthiness. We use the
Berg, Dickhaut and McCabe {[}Berg, J., Dickhaut, I., \& McCabe, K.
(1995). Trust, reciprocity, and social history. Games and Economic
Behavior, 10, 122-142] investment game to generate indices of trust and
reciprocity. Prior to their participation in the investment game, all
subjects participated in two other games. One is used to measure their
social value orientation (a measure of other regarding behavior) and the
second to measure risk attitudes. These variables are introduced as
treatments in the analysis of the trust and reciprocity data. In
addition to these preference related variables, gender is introduced to
capture any differences between men and women which may not be
encompassed by value orientation and risk attitudes. The statistical
analysis indicates that the social value orientation measure
significantly accounts for variation in trust and reciprocity. As well,
the level of trust exhibited by an investor significantly affects the
reciprocity of the responders and this measure of trust interacts with
social value orientation. individuals who are highly pro-social
reciprocate more as the sender's trust increases, while those who are
highly pro-self reciprocate less as the sender's trust increases. For
this sample of participants, the gender variable does not capture any
differences in the behavior of men and women that is not already
reflected by the differences captured by their value orientations. Risk
attitudes do not significantly account for variation in trusting
behavior, except for the case where individuals have neither strongly
pro-social nor pro-self social value orientations. In this case, more
risk-seeking individuals are more trusting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

"{Caffeinated drinks are commonly consumed in social gatherings. However,
their effects on social behavior remain unclear. The present study
examined the effects of caffeinated, coffee on antidepressant-related
co-operative behavior. Seventy-seven low-caffeine users took part in a
randomized, double-blind, cross-over study of single dose of caffeinated
coffee (150 mg caffeine) and decaffeinated coffee (9 mg caffeine) with
at least a le day washout period. In each session, participants were
asked to imagine a fictitious person and play the Mixed Motive Game with
that person 45 min after coffee consumption. Heart rated blood pressured
and state moods were measured at baseline and at 45 min poste coffee
consumption. After caffeinated coffee, participants exhibited
significantly higher blood pressure. They also allocated significantly
fewer scores to themselves and sent significantly more sadness message
during the game. These results suggest that caffeinated coffee may help
to improve social support and depressive symptoms.}"
"{Angry mood and aggression are strongly associated. However, it is not
socially acceptable to express strong aggression. Non-cooperative
behaviours might be another aspect of aggressive behaviour. The present
study examines the expression of non-cooperative behaviours after angry
mood induction. Eighty-five university students were randomly assigned
to hot or cool focus recall of a past angry event. At baseline, trait
aggression and rejection sensitivity were evaluated. Just before the
recall task, participants' state of angry mood was measured by the Anger
Mood Scale. Then they engaged in either hot or cool focus recall of a
past rejection event. Immediately after the mood induction, angry mood
was measured again. They were then instructed to play the Mixed Motive
game with an unknown person. Participants in both groups became angrier
after the mood induction. One-way analysis of covariance, controlling
for trait anger and rejection sensitivity, showed that the hot-focus
participants gave significantly fewer points to the other person than
the cool-focus participants. Participants high on trait aggression sent
more verbally aggressive messages. The findings suggest that
noncooperative behaviour is another form of anger related aggression and
might be more socially important than overt aggression.}"
"{Subtle contextual social cues and the explicit incentive structure of
social dilemmas are two important, but fundamentally different classes
of determinants of cooperative behavior. The former provides subjective
social information regarding the likelihood of attaining mutual
cooperation by shaping one's expectations of the cooperative behavior of
the interacting party. The latter provides objective, ecological
information about the strategic opportunities offered by the situation.
In prior research, both classes have generally been studied in
isolation, hampering insight into how social judgments and ecological
opportunities interact in shaping cooperation. To fill in this gap we
set up a repeated mixed-motive game in which we manipulate subtle social
cues and the incentive structure of the game simultaneously. We develop
the hypothesis that social information is less important in shaping
mutual cooperation of two team members when the incentive structure is
such that it contains natural synergies. In contrast, when the incentive
structure offers no synergy, ``rational contracting{''} is hampered and
social cues are essential for mutual cooperation to develop. The
evidence we present in this paper is consistent with this hypothesis.

"{In 7 experiments, the authors manipulated social exclusion by telling
people that they would end up alone later in life or that other
participants had rejected them. Social exclusion caused a substantial
reduction in prosocial behavior. Socially excluded people donated less
money to a student fund, were unwilling to volunteer for further lab
experiments, were less helpful after a mishap, and cooperated less in a
mixed-motive game with another student. The results did not vary by cost
to the self or by recipient of the help, and results remained
significant when the experimenter was unaware of condition. The effect
was mediated by feelings of empathy for another person but was not
mediated by mood, state self-esteem, belongingness, trust, control, or
self-awareness. The implication is that rejection temporarily interferes
with emotional responses, thereby impairing the capacity for empathic
understanding of others, and as a result, any inclination to help or
cooperate with them is undermined.}"
"{This article puts forward a parsimonious framework for studying
subjective perceptions of real-life intergroup conflicts. Four studies
were conducted to explore how individuals perceive the strategic
properties of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Studies 1 and 2 found
themy-driven associations between people's subjective perception of the
conflict's structure as a Chicken, Assurance, or Prisoners Dilemma game
and their ingroup/outgroup perceptions, national identification,
religiosity, political partisanship, voting behavior, and right-wing
authoritarianism. Studies 3 and 4 manipulated the saliency of the needs
for cognitive closure and security, respectively, demonstrating that
these needs affect people's endorsement of the game models as
descriptions of the conflict.}"
"{Adaptive social behavior often necessitates choosing to cooperate with
others for long-term gains at the expense of noncooperative behaviors
giving larger immediate gains. Although little is know about the neural
substrates that support cooperative over noncooperative behaviors,
recent research has shown that mutually cooperative behavior in the
context of a mixed-motive game, the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), is
associated with increased neural activity within reinforcement
circuitry. Other research attests to a role for serotonin in the
modulation of social behavior and in reward processing. In this study,
we used a within-subject, crossover, double-blind design to investigate
performance of an iterated, sequential PD game for monetary reward by
healthy human adult participants following ingestion of an amino-acid
drink that either did (T+) or did not (T-) contain l-tryptophan.
Tryptophan depletion produced significant reductions in the level of
cooperation shown by participants when playing the game on the first,
but not the second, study days. This effect was accompanied by a
significantly diminished probability of cooperative responding given
previous mutually cooperative behavior. These data suggest that
serotonin plays a significant role in the acquisition of socially
cooperative behavior in human adult participants, and suggest novel
hypotheses concerning the serotonergic modulation of reward information
in socially cooperative behavior in both health and psychiatric illness.}"
"{Background: Abnormal social behaviour, which is a common feature of
psychiatric disorders, is associated with rejection. A passive lack of
participation or involvement has been studied as characteristic of
depression but active forms of nonparticipation have received little
experimental attention. This study examined the interpersonal
consequences of four distinct types of social behaviour by using the
role enactment method. Two of the roles portrayed abnormal social
behaviour, active nonparticipant `manic' and passive nonparticipant
`sad', and two portrayed normal social behaviour, active participant
`warm' and passive participant `shy'. Methods: Sixty-three normal
subjects were randomly allocated to a brief dyadic social interaction
with a confederate acting one of four roles. Subsequently, they rated
their level of rejection of the confederate and took part in the
mixed-motive game with him/her. Results: The subjects were more likely
to reject confederates in the abnormal social behaviour roles. This was
shown on both their nonverbal behaviour and their verbal report. On the
mixed-motive game, subjects gave fewer points and less cooperative and
ingratiating messages to the confederates who had displayed abnormal
social behaviour. Limitations: This result might only reveal the effects
of first impressions of a confederate who behaves in a particular way,
but not be generalised to long term acquaintanceship. Conclusions: These
results extend previous findings that passive nonparticipant behaviour
leads to rejection to active nonparticipant behaviour and show that the
consequences of displaying such behaviour not only result in rejection
but also in the reduction of social reinforcement. This might slow a
patient's recovery process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

"{Reboxetine is a novel antidepressant with a selective action on

took part in a randomized double-blind, crossover study of 2 weeks
treatment with reboxetine (4 mg b.d.) and placebo with a 2-week washout

other (flatmate) received no treatment. On the last day of each

confederate behaving as a responsive person) in a stranger-dyadic social
interaction paradigm. After the interaction, subjects played the
Mixed-Motive game, which measures cooperative behaviour and
communication, with the confederate. Subjects read a short story before
and after the social interaction. The flatmates evaluated the social
behaviour of the subjects before and at the end of the two treatment
periods. On reboxetine, the subjects were rated to be significantly more
agreeable and cooperative (passive participant) and less Submissive by
their flatmates. They showed significantly less eye contact with the
confederate in the social interaction paradigm and gave significantly
fewer helplessness messages during the game. They spoke faster on the

that reboxetine increases cooperative social behaviour and increases
social drive, which might be important for social adaptation.}"
"{Rationale: Deficiencies in serotonin function have been associated with
irritability and aggression but enhancing, serotonin has also been shown
to promote social status and affiliative behaviour in non-human primates
and more recently in humans. Objectives: To investigate the effects of
citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), on social
behaviour with a flatmate and a stranger. Methods: Ten pairs of healthy
volunteers took part in a randomized double-blind crossover study of 2
weeks treatment with citalopram (20 mg/day) and placebo with a 2-week
washout period. In each pair, one person (subject) took the tablets and
the other (flatmate) received no treatment. On the last day of each
treatment period, the subjects socially interacted with a confederate
behaving as a responsive person in a stranger-dyadic social interaction
paradigm. After the interaction, subjects played the Mixed-motive game,
which measures cooperative behaviour and communication, with the
confederate. The flatmates evaluated the social behaviour of the
subjects before and at the end of the treatment periods. Results: On
citalopram, the subjects were rated as significantly less submissive by
their flatmates and they showed a dominant pattern of eye contact in the
stranger-dyadic social interaction paradigm. They also reduced the
number of points they awarded themselves and sent more cooperative
messages during the game. Conclusions: These results indicate that
administration of an SSRI can modify social status in different
interactions and increase affiliative behaviour. They implicate a role
for serotonin in modulating social aspects of behaviour.}"
"{Rationale: Treatment with antidepressants has been shown to affect
social functioning, but drugs with actions on different
neurotransmitters may have a different profile of effects. Objective: To
study the effects of acute manipulation of two neurotransmitters,
serotonin and noradrenaline, on social behaviour in healthy volunteers.
Methods: Sixty volunteers were randomly assigned to a single dose of a
selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, reboxetine (4 mg), a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (10 mg), or placebo.
They socially interacted with a confederate behaving in a non-sociable
manner in a stranger-dyadic social interaction paradigm 1.5 h postdrug.
Social behaviour during the interaction was video recorded by a hidden
camera and subsequently analysed. After the interaction, volunteers
played the mixed-motive game with the confederate. This game has been
shown to measure cooperative behaviour and communication. Volunteers
read a short story and rated their mood predrug and before and after the
interaction. Results: Subjects on reboxetine showed reduced hand
fiddling during the interaction and gave significantly more cooperative
communications during the mixed-motive game. More volunteers on
reboxetine were classified as cooperative players. On the reading task,
the speech of subjects on citalopram showed less reduction of energy
variation after the social interaction. Conclusion: Reboxetine had clear
effects on social behaviour. Noradrenaline was related to increased
social engagement and cooperation and a reduction in self-focus.
Citalopram had less effect on cooperative behaviour but serotonin may be
associated with protection of the self from the negative consequences of
social interaction.}"
"{This research explores the effects of egocentric interpretations of
fairness, expectations about other actors' harvesting decisions, and
communication on the focal actor's harvesting decisions in asymmetric
social dilemmas. We found support for the predictions that egocentrism
exists in perceptions of fairness in asymmetric dilemmas, overharvesting
is positively related to the amount of egocentrism, and egocentrism is
stronger before discussion than after discussion. Furthermore, in a
comparison between asymmetric and symmetric dilemmas, we found that
egocentrism and overharvesting were greater in asymmetric dilemmas than
in symmetric dilemmas. Finally, the results indicate that among certain
actors, overharvesting in asymmetric dilemmas is positively related to
the amount of harvesting expected from the other parties. This study
contributes to the social dilemma literature by (1) introducing the idea
of egocentric interpretations of fairness as an explanation for
overharvesting behavior, (2) demonstrating that egocentrism is more
pronounced in asymmetric versus symmetric dilemmas, (3) suggesting that
the reduction of egocentric interpretations of fairness is another
reason why communication enhances cooperative behavior, and (4)
demonstrating that beliefs about what others will do is related to
harvesting decisions in asymmetric as well as symmetric dilemmas. (C)

"{Intragroup communication promotes cooperation in social dilemmas. Two
explanations are plausible: Discussion may (a) enhance feelings of group
identity or (b) induce commitments to cooperate. Some remedies for
social dilemmas (like group communication) may be subclassified as
public-welfare remedies (of which enhanced group identity is an example)
versus cooperation-contingent remedies (of which commitment is an
example). The efficacy of a cooperative act for enhancing the collective
welfare should moderate remedies of the former but not the latter type.
An experiment is reported in which group communication and the efficacy
of cooperation were manipulated. As expected if communication induced
commitments, but contrary to the group identity explanation, efficacy
did not moderate the effect of group discussion. Other analyses provided
more direct evidence that group members made and honored commitments to
cooperate.}"
"{Forgiveness research has predominately focused on individual/relational
outcomes such as well-being and closeness. Less research has examined
group outcomes such as cohesiveness or collective action. Forgiveness
studies have also emphasized the victim's or transgressor's perspective,
neglecting the effects of forgiveness on ingroup members who have
neither given nor received forgiveness. We theorize that forgiveness
promotes collective action among ingroup members through group
cohesiveness and that transgressors' apologetic reactions impact this
process. In a laboratory experiment, 229 students (175 females) were led
to believe they were in a social dilemma with three others. Some
participants witnessed group members forgive an apologetic, obstinate,
or neutral defector, whereas others witnessed an unforgiving response.
Forgiveness of apologetic and neutral defectors increased later
cooperation among ingroup members. This effect was generally mediated by
group cohesiveness. Our findings suggest that forgiveness can impact
cooperation on a group level, providing a path to successful resolutions
to collective action problems. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

"{We use skin conductance responses and self-reported hedonic valence to
study the emotional basis of cooperation and punishment in a social
dilemma. We argue that the availability of sanctions sets in motion a
``virtuous emotional circle{''} that accompanies cooperation. Emotional
reaction to free riding leads cooperators to apply sanctions. In
response, and in addition to the monetary consequences of receiving
sanctions, the negative emotions experienced by the free-riders when
punished lead them to increase their subsequent level of cooperation.
The outcome is an increased level of cooperation that becomes a new
norm. Therefore, emotions sustain both the use of altruistic punishment
and cooperation.}"
"{We analyze the effect of ``milestones{''} on reaching a long-term
target, which if missed implies dramatic payoff risks. In our
experiment, a cumulative threshold public goods game, milestones are
captured by intermediate contribution targets on the way to the final
target. Missing the final target leads to a probabilistic total loss for
all players, and missing intermediate targets may lead to the same
consequences even earlier. The additional intermediate targets feature
environmental protection as a process rather than a contest for reaching
a final target. The regulating agency is Nature, although political
agencies might implement a similar regulation. We test milestone effects
by varying the size of milestones in addition to changing the marginal
productivity of individual contributions and the payoff risk. Although
we observe some milestone effects, additional regulation by milestones
on its own does not guarantee that targets are reached. (C) 2013

"{The ability of groups to implement efficiency-enhancing institutions is
emerging as a central theme of research in economics. This study
explores voting on a scheme of intergroup competition, which facilitates
cooperation in a social dilemma situation. Experimental results show
that the competitive scheme fosters cooperation. Competition is popular
but the electoral outcome depends strongly on specific voting rules of
institutional choice. If the majority decide, competition is almost
always adopted. If likely losers from competition have veto power, it is
often not, and substantial gains in efficiency are foregone.}"
"{Recent findings have documented a negative relation of basal endogenous
cortisol and aggression after a provocation (i.e., reactive aggression)
in humans. We build on these findings and investigated the relation of
endogenous cortisol and reactive aggression in a social dilemma
situation, that is, costly punishment of individuals who did not
appropriately contribute to a common group project. Specifically, we
predicted that basal cortisol is negatively related to costly punishment
of uncooperative individuals. In the present study, basal cortisol was
assessed prior to a public goods game with the option to punish other
group members. In line with previous research on reactive aggression and
basal cortisol, we found that basal cortisol was indeed negatively
related to costly punishment. The findings are important for
understanding costly punishment because this tendency has been
documented as a possible basis for the evolution of cooperation.}"
"When people are confronted with social dilemmas, their decision-making strategies tend to be associated with individual social preferences; prosocials have an intrinsic willingness to cooperate, while proselfs need extrinsic motivators signaling personal gain. In this study, the biological roots for the proselfs/prosocials concept are explored by investigating the neural correlates of cooperative versus defect decisions when participants engage in a series of one-shot, anonymous prisoner’s dilemma situations. Our data are in line with previous studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognition regions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex, temporo–parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and that dispositional trust positively affects prosocials’ decisions to cooperate. At the neural level, however, dispositional trust appears to exert a greater marginal effect on brain activity of proselfs in three social cognition regions, which does not translate into an increase in cooperation. An event-related analysis shows that cooperating prosocials show significantly more activation in the precuneus (BA 7) than proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret this result to be consistent with prosocials’ enhanced tendency to infer the intentions of others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm congruence when they decide to cooperate.

"Previous functional imaging studies investigating the neural basis of strategic decision making in the prisoner’s dilemma reported a correlation between cooperative behavior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity; however, the precise function of the DLPFC in establishing cooperation remains unclear so far. The present study investigated the causal role of the DLPFC in an iterative prisoner’s dilemma game with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We discovered that disrupting the DLPFC with TMS decreased cooperation rates in comparison to control conditions, with this effect being most pronounced when the partner had defected previously. Thus, the current results suggest that the DLPFC contributes to strategic decision making in the prisoner’s dilemma game. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Networks with dependency links are more vulnerable when facing the attacks. Recent research also has demonstrated that the interdependent groups support the spreading of cooperation. We study the prisoner’s dilemma games on spatial networks with dependency links, in which a fraction of individual pairs is selected to depend on each other. The dependency individuals can gain an extra payoff whose value is between the payoff of mutual cooperation and the value of temptation to defect. Thus, this mechanism reflects that the dependency relation is stronger than the relation of ordinary mutual cooperation, but it is not large enough to cause the defection of the dependency pair. We show that the dependence of individuals hinders, promotes and never affects the cooperation on regular ring networks, square lattice, random and scale-free networks, respectively. The results for the square lattice and regular ring networks are demonstrated by the pair approximation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We find that differences in the ability to devote cognitive resources to a strategic interaction imply differences in strategic behavior. In our experiment, we manipulated the availability of cognitive resources by applying a differential cognitive load. In cognitive load experiments, subjects are directed to perform a task which occupies cognitive resources, in addition to making a choice in another domain. The greater the cognitive resources required for the task implies that fewer such resources are available for deliberation on the choice. In our experiment, subjects played a finitely repeated multi-player prisoner’s dilemma game under two cognitive load treatments. In one treatment, subjects were placed under a high cognitive load (given a 7 digit number to recall) and subjects in the other were placed under a low cognitive load (given a 2 digit number). According to two different measures, we find evidence that the low load subjects behaved more strategically. First, the low load subjects exhibited more strategic defection near the end of play than the high load subjects. Second, we find evidence that low load subjects were better able to condition their behavior on the outcomes of previous periods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In the present experiment, we simultaneously examine the effect of personality and situational factors on decisions in a social dilemma game. Our first question is what temperament and character factors would make Machiavellian people successful in social interactions? The second question refers to situational factors: how does the composition of the group influence the Machiavellians’ decisions? Using Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) scales, the scores on Mach IV test showed a positive correlation with Novelty Seeking and a negative correlation with Reward Dependence, Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-Transcendence. We found that the Mach scores negatively correlated with the players’ contribution over the game, and positively with the total profit they gained by the end of the game. Regression analyses revealed that the contribution of high Mach persons (those who had relatively high scores on Mach scale) to the public good were primarily influenced by the number of altruists in the group, whereas low Machs’ decisions were influenced more by a temperament factor (Persistence). We assume that, compared to others, Machiavellians may be more sensitive to situational factors and take the behavior of their playmates into account to a greater degree, which may lead to their success in the exploitation of others.

"The few studies examining the association between behavioral economic games and five-factor personality traits have shown mixed results. This study sought to establish a more stable link between behavioral economic games and the five-factor model by comparing four commonly used games with the results of a five-factor inventory. Individuals under criminal justice supervision in the community (n = 83) were combined with a comparison group (n = 41) and completed a 120-item measure that provides the five-factor scales and six facets for each factor. All participants played the ultimatum game, prisoner’s dilemma, public goods game (with punishment), and the trust game against an experimenter who used a predefined strategy. Controlling for relevant covariates, personality was associated with scores from the prisoner’s dilemma and the public goods game. Extroversion was associated with more cooperative game play in the prisoner’s dilemma and higher contributions in the public goods game. Higher levels of Extroversion and Openness were associated with low levels of antisocial punishment, whereas higher levels of Conscientiousness and lower levels of Neuroticism were related to higher levels of prosocial punishment. While the link between extroversion and more prosocial behavior across games should add a degree of clarity towards understanding the link between behavioral economic games and personality, results from the public goods game are difficult to place in the context of previous research, as this was the first time the five-factor model was examined in relation to punishment. The findings suggest that propensities to use antisocial and prosocial punishment differ from each other. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Objective: To investigate the relationship of charitable behavior and life satisfaction in college students. Methods: Totally 194 college students were surveyed by using the 'prisoner's dilemma' task to assess charitable behavior tendency, the donating experiment to assess the actual donation money and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) for life satisfaction. The partial correlation analysis and linear regression were used to explore the relationship of charitable behavior tendency, donation and life satisfaction. Results: There was significant positive correlation between charitable behavior tendency and SWLS scores (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 05). The scores of actual donation were significantly and positively correlated with SWLS scores (r = 0. 19, P < 0. 05). The scores of life satisfaction of college students were positively associated with both scores of charitable behavior tendency (p = 0. 21, P < 0. 05) and donation (β = 0. 19. P < 0. 05). Conclusion: It suggests that individuals with higher life satisfaction may be likely to do charitable behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In this paper, using a within-subjects design, we estimate the utility weights that subjects attach to the outcome of their interaction partners in four decision situations: (1) binary Dictator Games (DG), second player’s role in the sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) after the first player (2) cooperated and (3) defected, and (4) first player’s role in the sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma game. We find that the average weights in these four decision situations have the following order: ( 1 ) > ( 2 ) > ( 4 ) > ( 3 ) . Moreover, the average weight is positive in (1) but negative in (2), (3), and (4). Our findings indicate the existence of strong negative and small positive reciprocity for the average subject, but there is also high interpersonal variation in the weights in these four nodes. We conclude that the PD frame makes subjects more competitive than the DG frame. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we simultaneously analyze beliefs of subjects about others’ utility weights in the same four decision situations. We compare several alternative theoretical models on beliefs, e.g., rational beliefs (Bayesian-Nash equilibrium) and a consensus model. Our results on beliefs strongly support the consensus effect and refute rational beliefs: there is a strong relationship between own preferences and beliefs and this relationship is relatively stable across the four decision situations.

"The following reports on multiple studies in a line of research examining the use of emotionally expressive writing as a means of altering the experiences of state anger and negative affect. This line of research has also sought to develop an iterative economic version of the prisoner's dilemma game as a behavioral measure of changes in state anger. Preliminary studies demonstrated evidence that expressive writing about an angry memory does trigger initial activations of state anger and negative affect but that subsequent repeated writing does lead to reductions in activation of state anger and negative affect. The current study sought to expand upon those prior findings and more adequately test whether or not such reductions in the activation of state anger and negative affect can be attributed to habituation as a mechanism of change. The differential effects of different schedules of writing/exposure were also investigated. The current study reports data from 100 student participants. All participants participated in three study sessions scheduled two to three days apart. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: A Spaced Exposure Condition in which participants wrote about an angry memory once on each of three participation days. A Massed Exposure with Long Retention condition in which participants wrote twice about an angry memory on the first day, did not write the second day, and wrote again about an angry memory the third day. A Massed Exposure with Brief Retention condition in which participants did not write the first day, wrote twice about an angry memory the second day, and wrote once about an angry memory the final day. And a Neutral Writing Control group in which participants wrote about different emotionally neutral memories on each of the first two days and an angry memory on the final day. All participants played the economic prisoner's dilemma game on the first and last day of participation to examine differences in competitive behavior that may correlate with amount of expressive writing and levels of state anger and negative affect. The results found that expressive writing about an angry memory was consistently effective in triggering an acute increase in state anger and negative affect. There was some evidence of both within session and between session reductions of state anger and negative affect following repeated writing about an angry memory; however, these effects were tenuous and not able to be dissociated from uncontrolled factors occurring with the passage of time. Therefore, the results were unable to demonstrate evidence for habituation as a mechanism of change. The results are not able to provide support for any differential advantage to spaced or massed exposure sessions. The study does not support the use of the economic version of prisoner's dilemma game as a behavioral measure of changes in state anger. The limitations of the study and potential future empirical directions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The human grief response has perplexed researchers. Grief is costly, leading to painful and potentially deleterious symptoms. Yet, it is a human universal. We argue that grief functions as a hard-to-fake signal of underlying capacities to form strong social bonds. If so, those who grieve more intensively than others should be perceived as higher quality social partners. We tested this hypothesis in 4 studies. High grievers were rated as nicer, more loyal, and more trustworthy than low grievers. High grievers were also expected to cooperate in a prisoner’s dilemma more than low grievers. Last, high grievers were chosen as a trusted social partner more than another individual who expressed sadness for lost material items, indicating that grief may be a specific display of distress that is particularly informative to potential social partners. These results support a signaling theory of grief and are discussed in that context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In this dissertation I explore cultural evolution and its influence on cooperation and conflict in humans. In the first chapter I show that an explanation for human altruism cannot rely solely on direct reciprocity and likely requires both cultural selection and groups. In the second I argue, with Sarah Mathew, that this insight applies especially well to between-group conflict in humans and can explain the unique scale and intensity of human warfare. In the third, I show how these 'norm dynamics,'' operating in an international system undergoing a 'globalization of ideas'' might help explain a decrease in interstate war over the last sixty years. In many societies, humans cooperate altruistically in economic experiments at much higher levels than would be expected if their goal was maximizing economic returns—even when interactions are anonymous and one-shot. This is a puzzle because there is no personal benefit in paying a cost to help another play in one-shot anonymous interactions. What are the origins of this seemingly altruistic behavior? This paper explores the logic of two competing hypotheses. The 'norm psychology'' hypothesis holds that pro-social play stems primarily from socially-learned cultural norms. In contrast, the 'evolutionary mismatch'' hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically humans' ancient past among our hunter-gatherer ancestors. In Chapter 1 I compare whether the conditions thought to create these genetic predispositions, repeated interactions under uncertainty, better support the conditions for the mismatch hypothesis (groups will be predominantly cooperative) or the norm psychology hypothesis (there will be wide variation between groups). As a test case, I adopt a model of the mismatch hypothesis developed by Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides and Tooby (DKCT). In the model agents play Prisoner's Dilemma games, but are uncertain whether an interaction is one-shot or repeated. In DKCT's simulations, populations of agents consistently evolve high levels of cooperation in one-shot games, even when they have strong evidence that an interaction is not repeated. This finding is consistent with the premises of the mismatch hypothesis. However, DKCT limit their agents' strategic possibilities to only two strategies, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) or Always Defect (ALLD). I show that their results are an artifact of the particular evolutionary trajectory caused by the interaction between these strategies. With different mixes of initial strategies, even when TFT starts out very common, the resulting frequency of one-shot cooperation varies widely—in some cases driving one-shot cooperation almost entirely from the population under a wide range of conditions. This finding better supports the norm psychology hypothesis than the mismatch hypothesis. I conclude that understanding variation between human groups is key for understanding the conditions that favor altruistic cooperation in human metapopulations. We argue that the scale and intensity of human warfare can best be explained by cultural selection operating in a group-structured environment (group-structured cultural selection). This view is backed by theoretical and empirical findings showing that cultural variation is much more likely than genetic variation to be partitioned by group membership when groups are large. In Chapter 2 we use historical and ethnographic examples to show that human warfare meets two sufficient and necessary conditions for group-structured cultural selection: there is variation in traits between groups that influence the outcome of warfare, the outcome of warfare influences the distribution of these traits between groups. Furthermore, alternative theories of human warfare that exogenize preferences, exogenize institutions or only include genetic transmission are incomplete theories that cannot account for the scale and intensity of human warfare.

"It has often been observed that people cooperate more than they would be expected to according to standard assumptions of individual rationality. In part, this empirical anomaly is due to the unrealistic assumptions concerning human behavior in economic models. Our study aims to offer new foundations for strategic decision-making behavior of individuals. We argue that human capital and personality traits are key in deciding whether or not to cooperate with a counterpart. Furthermore,-we argue that the effect of a particular personality trail—that is, locus of control—on cooperative behavior is moderated by the level of human capital. The hypotheses are tested using Prisoner's Dilemma games in an experiment with 182 university students. The results report significant direct effects of human capital and locus of control on cooperation and confirm the moderating relationship between the two. Internals tend to cooperate more when having high levels of human capital. For externals, the effect is opposite, that is, externals lend to cooperate more when having low levels of human capital. In so doing, we open the black box of individual decision-making behavior and contribute to a growing field of behavior of strategy research that aims to strengthen the empirical relevance and practical usefulness of management theory.

"Presents a study which aims to examine the effect of oxytocin in the perception of social deception. To clarify the role of oxytocin in this complex and dynamic context, the subjects watched clips of TV-show contestants making voluntary and spontaneous proclamations of their trustworthiness in an adaptation of the prisoner’s dilemma in return for monetary rewards of up to several thousand dollars. Under oxytocin, subjects were less accurate than placebo at predicting contestant decisions and only in the placebo condition were subjects able to accurately predict contestants’ decisions with a probability higher than chance. Additional analysis ruled out the possibility that the effects of oxytocin were affected by contestant partners’ decisions, subjects’ beliefs about whether they had received oxytocin or the placebo, or differences in mood or interpersonal closeness. Rather than improving subjects’ inferences about others’ mental states, oxytocin impeded accurate assessments of trustworthiness in risky social exchanges. Oxytocin decreased prediction accuracy but did not increase predictions of cooperative behavior in general. A possible mechanism consistent with these results may be that oxytocin suppresses the attentional salience of negative social stimuli, resulting in lowered social vigilance and arousal (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"When people have the chance to help others at a cost to themselves, are cooperative decisions driven by intuition or reflection? To answer this question, recent studies have tested the relationship between reaction times (RTs) and cooperation, reporting both positive and negative correlations. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we argue that decision conflict (rather than the use of intuition vs. reflection) drives response times, leading to an inverted-U shaped relationship between RT and cooperation. Studies 1 through 3 show that intermediate decisions take longer than both extremely selfish and extremely cooperative decisions. Studies 4 and 5 find that the conflict between self-interested and cooperative motives explains individual differences in RTs. Manipulating conflictedness causes longer RTs and more intermediate decisions, and RTs mediate the relationship between conflict and intermediate decisions. Finally, Studies 6 and 7 demonstrate that conflict is distinct from reflection by manipulating the use of intuition (vs. reflection). Experimentally promoting reliance on intuition increases cooperation, but has no effects on decision extremity or feelings of conflictedness. In sum, we provide evidence that RTs should not be interpreted as a direct proxy for the use of intuitive or reflective processes, and dissociate the effects of conflict and reflection in social decision making.

"In social dilemmas individual behavior creates external effects on others. In such situations, a person's opinions concerning right and wrong might influence his behavior. Understanding moral opinions therefore is important. This paper reports on an experiment which shows that moral opinions are conditional on the behavior of others. This is demonstrated by the finding that a large majority of subjects in a public good game experiment report personal normative beliefs that increase with the actual contributions made by group members. This finding is important for the design of policies attempting to sustain public good provisions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We test whether people with a relatively more intrinsic vs. extrinsic value orientation (RIEVO) are particularly likely to enact cooperative behavior in resource dilemmas when they are primed with relatedness goals. In Study 1, high RIEVO participants primed with relatedness exhibited more restrained fishing behavior in a resource dilemma than their unprimed counterparts or participants low in RIEVO. Study 2 replicated this effect and further showed that the prime must signal the possibility of satisfying a valued goal (relatedness satisfaction) in order to elicit the value-consistent behavior. We discuss these results in the context of recent process models of goal priming, and also discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of cooperative behavior and the predictive power of value constructs more broadly.

"What makes people willing to pay costs to benefit others? Does such cooperation require effortful self-control, or do automatic, intuitive processes favor cooperation? Time pressure has been shown to increase cooperative behavior in Public Goods Games, implying a predisposition towards cooperation. Consistent with the hypothesis that this predisposition results from the fact that cooperation is typically advantageous outside the lab, it has further been shown that the time pressure effect is undermined by prior experience playing lab games (where selfishness is the more advantageous strategy). Furthermore, a recent study found that time pressure increases cooperation even in a game framed as a competition, suggesting that the time pressure effect is not the result of social norm compliance. Here, we successfully replicate these findings, again observing a positive effect of time pressure on cooperation in a competitively framed game, but not when using the standard cooperative framing. These results suggest that participants’ intuitions favor cooperation rather than norm compliance, and also that simply changing the framing of the Public Goods Game is enough to make it appear novel to participants and thus to restore the time pressure effect.

"Most common pool resource (CPR) dilemmas share two features: they evolve over time and they are managed under environmental uncertainties. We propose a stylized dynamic model that integrates these two dimensions. A distinguishing feature of our model is that the duration of the game is determined endogenously by the users’ collective decisions. In the proposed model, if the resource stock level below which the irreversible event occurs is known in advance, then the optimal resource use coincides with a unique symmetric equilibrium that guarantees survival of the resource. As the uncertainty about the threshold level increases, resource use increases if users adopt decision strategies that quickly deplete the resource stock, but decreases if they adopt path strategies guaranteeing that the unknown threshold level is never exceeded. We show that under relatively high uncertainty about resource size, CPR users frequently implement decision strategies that terminate the game immediately. When this uncertainty is reduced, they maintain a positive resource level for longer durations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A vast amount of empirical and theoretical research on public good games indicates that the threat of punishment can curb free-riding in human groups engaged in joint enterprises. Since punishment is often costly, however, this raises an issue of second-order free-riding: indeed, the sanctioning system itself is a common good which can be exploited. Most investigations, so far, considered peer punishment: players could impose fines on those who exploited them, at a cost to themselves. Only a minority considered so-called pool punishment. In this scenario, players contribute to a punishment pool before engaging in the joint enterprise, and without knowing who the free-riders will be. Theoretical investigations (Sigmund et al., Nature 466:861–863, 2010) have shown that peer punishment is more efficient, but pool punishment more stable. Social learning, i.e., the preferential imitation of successful strategies, should lead to pool punishment if sanctions are also imposed on second-order free-riders, but to peer punishment if they are not. Here we describe an economic experiment (the Mutual Aid game) which tests this prediction. We find that pool punishment only emerges if second-order free riders are punished, but that peer punishment is more stable than expected. Basically, our experiment shows that social learning can lead to a spontaneously emerging social contract, based on a sanctioning institution to overcome the free rider problem.

"Recent work shows that both reward and punishment systems increase short-term cooperation in social dilemmas. Yet, a growing body of research finds that punishment systems generate a range of negative side effects, including an undermining of trust in fellow group members’ cooperative intentions. The present work asks whether reward systems can generate the same positive effects as punishment systems (increased cooperation) without the negative side effects (decreased interpersonal trust) or whether reward systems also lead to detrimental effects on trust. In two experiments we find that once removed, reward systems, like punishment systems, reduced trust to levels below a control group who never experienced sanctions. This research highlights the detrimental effects of punishment and reward systems on intragroup trust and thus shows that while reward systems can generate the same positive effects as punishment systems, they also generate the same negative side effects.

"This study investigates two centralized punishment institutions for a linear public goods game. These institutions require a certain contribution level and sanction under-contributing players. The two differ in who, among those who do not meet this requirement, receive sanctions. In one institution, all violators are sanctioned, and in the other, only the worst violator(s) is sanctioned. Theoretically, the public goods game of the latter institution yields contributions equal to or greater than that of the former institution with the same requirement and sanction level. The results of an experiment support this theoretical prediction. However, there is a discrepancy between the theory and laboratory observations in that the institution with the theoretically optimal requirement did not yield the highest profit.

"How do people make inferences about other people’s minds from their emotion displays? The ability to infer others’ beliefs, desires, and intentions from their facial expressions should be especially important in interdependent decision making when people make decisions from beliefs about the others’ intention to cooperate. Five experiments tested the general proposition that people follow principles of appraisal when making inferences from emotion displays, in context. Experiment 1 revealed that the same emotion display produced opposite effects depending on context: When the other was competitive, a smile on the other’s face evoked a more negative response than when the other was cooperative. Experiment 2 revealed that the essential information from emotion displays was derived from appraisals (e.g., Is the current state of affairs conducive to my goals? Who is to blame for it?); facial displays of emotion had the same impact on people’s decision making as textual expressions of the corresponding appraisals. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 used multiple mediation analyses and a causal-chain design: Results supported the proposition that beliefs about others’ appraisals mediate the effects of emotion displays on expectations about others’ intentions. We suggest a model based on appraisal theories of emotion that posits an inferential mechanism whereby people retrieve, from emotion expressions, information about others’ appraisals, which then lead to inferences about others’ mental states. This work has implications for the design of algorithms that drive agent behavior in human–agent strategic interaction, an emerging domain at the interface of computer science and social psychology.

"This dissertation addresses design challenges in the study of player goals found in game theory and education by introducing The Farmers , an asymmetric, three player, non-competitive, non-collaborative, semi-cooperative, common-pool resource dilemma simulation game designed to elicit political debate and in-game moral claims (Fennewald and Kievit-Kylar, 2012, 2013). Human experiments and artificial simulations of The Farmers are used to investigate the differences between how players and simulated agents act when given collaborative, competitive, and semi-cooperative/independent goals, (goals where players have personal goals not directly tied to the success of other players). Moral discussions from the game are analyzed using Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt, 2012) and Kohlberg's Theory of Moral development (Kohlberg, 1973, 1981). Findings suggest differences among the three versions of the game (collaborative, competitive, and independent versions) and evidence that a variety of moral foundations are used by players to explain and justify their actions during game play, especially when players are given independent goals. This is likely at least in part due to the independent goals design of the game, which emphasizes zero-sum success for individual players while at the same time fostering non-zero sum interaction among players. This study presents a methodology for designing simulation games to present goals found in non-competitive, non-cooperative interactions (such as goals found in many ecological and political debates). This study finds that sanctity is one of several moral foundations used to provide justification of anomalous actions in social dilemma game play. The study should be of interest to anyone wishing to design games-based studies of collaboration and negotiation for business, social science, and education that are rich with moral claims.

"The choice to conserve or be greedy in a commons dilemma may be influenced by the behavior of others and by pro-environmental values. Participants completed a measure of pro-environmental values one week before taking part in an Internet-based commons dilemma microworld consisting of a shared fishery with three computer-controlled virtual fishers whom participants believed to be real people. The three virtual fishers either behaved greedily (taking an unsustainable number of fish each season) or sustainably. In the sustainable scenario, virtual fishers left abundant numbers of fish for the participant and, thus, pro-environmental values were not related to harvesting decisions. However, in the greedy scenario, participants’ pro-environmental values significantly predicted sustainable behavior, demonstrating that the influence of others’ greediness may be overridden by pro-environmental values.

Not many films confront us with a moral dilemma and at the same time invite us to think urgently about how to solve it, but Eye in the Sky does so. Here’s the dilemma. On the street outside the house, 9-year-old Alia has set up a table and is selling loaves of bread; calculations show that the missile from the eye-in-the-sky drone will not only kill the people in the house but that it is likely to kill her, too. How likely? Perhaps 65%. But what if the aiming point for the missile were changed from a point on the house’s roof above the room where the suicide bombers are to a point at the edge of the building, furthest away from Alia? How much would that reduce her chance of being killed? Our tension mounts as we see the suicide bombers being fitted with explosives, as we watch Alia selling her bread, as the drone pilot who can see her in his drone pictures expresses his reluctance to act, and as the Whitehall discussion swirls around with a decision being made to consult government officials at the very top in both Britain and America, which will involve further delays. In the modern world, there is an intensified focus on terrorism, as well as on drones for surveillance and destruction. We may sense, too, the ambiguity of the term 'collateral damage.'

"As in studies of self-control, a tit-for-tat contingency in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game creates a conflict between maximization of local and global reinforcement. The present experiments examine this conflict in a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma game. Versus tit for tat, cooperation corresponds to self-control; defection, always immediately reinforced, corresponds to impulsiveness. Three experiments examined sensitivity of behavior to the global reinforcement contingency imposed by tit for tat. Undergraduates played a five-player prisoner's dilemma game against four dummy players programmed to play tit for tat or randomly. With tit for tat, a player's cooperation (or defection) increased dummy players' cooperation (or defection) on subsequent trials--reinforcing cooperation and punishing defection in the long run. Participants cooperated at a higher rate when the dummy players played tit for tat than when the dummy players played randomly. These results are consistent with findings in corresponding studies of self-control. Some participants, caught in a trap of mutual defection with the tit-for-tat playing dummy players, came to cooperate when the tit-for-tat contingency was reset ('forgiving' participants' previous defections) during a pause in the game. This increase was a result of the combined effects of a pause and reset; neither pausing nor resetting independently resulted in an increase in cooperation.

In Experiment 1, players achieved a criterion of five consecutive self-control responses more quickly as a positive function of trial spacing, the presence between trials of a discriminative stimulus associated with the upcoming payoff matrix, and the probability that the self-control or defection response would be reciprocated by the computer. Experiment 2 replicated the effect of trial spacing except when there was an interfering task during the interval, suggesting that trial spacing permits better appreciation of the contingencies.

"A number of authors have proposed that preference for a larger, delayed reward in delay discounting is similar to cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game versus tit-for-tat. This proposal was examined by correlating delay-discounting (Experiment 1) and probability-discounting (Experiment 2) rates for hypothetical monetary gains and losses with performance in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game. Correlations between rate of delay discounting (discounting parameters and area under the curve) and proportion of cooperation in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game versus tit-for-tat were significant across three magnitudes, and correlations were generally higher with discounting for losses than with that for gains. As was expected, correlations between rate of delay discounting and performance versus a random strategy in the prisoner's dilemma game were not significant. Correlations between rate of probability-discounting and cooperation rate in a repeated prisoner's dilemma game versus neither a tit-for-tat nor a random strategy were significant.

"This reprinted article originally appeared in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, 1991, 35[4], 691-719. In the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in problems of cooperation, stimulated largely by Axelrod's work. Using an innovative tournament approach, Axelrod found that a simple strategy, tit-for-tat (TFT), was most successful in playing the repeated prisoner's dilemma (PD) in a noiseless environment. However, recent analytical work has shown that monitoring problems caused by noise significantly impair TFT's effectiveness. The primary purpose of the present research is to discover whether there exist alternative strategies that perform well in noisy PDs. To investigate this question, the authors conducted a computer tournament The results of the tournament demonstrated that, consistent with analytical work, TFT performed rather poorly. In contrast, strategies that were generous (i.e., cooperated more than their partners did) were quite effective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In this paper, by simulations on an artificial social model, we analyze cooperative behavior of agents playing the prisoner's dilemma game, in which each of the agents has the two strategies: cooperate and defect. Because defect yields a better payoff whichever strategy an opponent chooses, it is rational for an agent to choose defect in a single game or a finite number of games. However, it is known that a pair of cooperates can also be a Nash equilibrium pair if the players do not know when the game is over or the game is infinitely repeated. To investigate such cooperative behavior, we employ an artificial social model called the Sugarscape and carry out simulations on the model. Arranging three kinds of environments in the Sugarscape, we examine cooperative behavior of agents who are essentially selfish, in a sense that they maximize their payoffs, and investigate influence of environmental changes on the cooperative behavior.

"Recent models of altruism point out the success of a strategy called 'Raise-The-Stakes' (RTS) in situations allowing variability in cooperation. In theory, RTS is difficult to exploit because it begins with a small investment in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). When its cooperation is reciprocated, RTS increases its generosity, thereby taking advantage of cooperative opportunities. Previous research has shown that human participants indeed adopt RTS but start out moderately cooperative rather than with a minimal investment. This raises the question how robust RTS is against exploitation, especially in a noisy situation. We investigate whether human participants vary their cooperation in interaction with reciprocators and cheaters in an iterated nondiscrete version of a PDG. When confronted with a strategy that matches the investment of the participant on the previous round, we find that participants are likely to increase cooperation. However, cooperation gradually breaks down in interaction with a strategy that undercuts the level of cooperation of the participants, indicating the robustness of RTS. In line with RTS modeling studies, but in contrast with the cheater detection literature, we find that human participants are less willing to increase cooperation when the perceived likelihood of mistakes increases.

"Classic game theory considers defection to be the rational choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Although defection maximizes a player's gain regardless of the opponent's choice, many players cooperate. We suggest that cooperation can be explained in part by expectations of reciprocal behavior, that is, by the belief that players facing the same situation probably will come to the same decision. In Experiment 1, expectations of reciprocity were experimentally manipulated. As predicted, cooperation increased monotonically with these expectations. In Experiment 2, experimentally manipulated expectations of opponent cooperation were not associated with higher rates of cooperation. These findings are interpreted in light of a general model of payoff maximization, and implications for other models (e.g., social value orientation) are discussed.

The game allows researchers to observe the emergence of trust and cooperation separately, and ascertain the causal relationship between them. In six studies that use the PD/D design, we find that the players of PD/D consistently achieve very high cooperation rates, sometimes mean cooperation rates of about 95%, which are higher than in standard PD games sharing similar design features. These findings demonstrate that separating trust from cooperation is critical for building trust relations. They also show that the GRIT (Graduated Reciprocation In Tension reduction) strategy helps build such relations in the absence of mutual trust. Our results suggest that it is cooperation which leads to trust, not the other way around. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We model the two-firm alliance as an iterated prisoners' dilemma game with an exit option and test several theoretical predictions over two experimental studies. A new major effect on alliance performance arises by including the exit option (i.e., the option to end the alliance and receive a fixed payoff that is less than the payoff for mutual cooperation but greater than the payoff for mutual defection). The opportunity cost levels of the firms either directly or indirectly influence alliance cooperation and alliance payoffs through affecting the alliance strategies that the firms choose. Implications for partner selection, alliance selection and structuring, and strategy choices along the alliance lifespan, build on these results.

"In three experiments, pigeons played an iterated prisoner's dilemma game against a tit-for-tat strategy. In this game, pigeons had a choice between cooperation and defection. Choices were reinforced according to a random-ratio schedule. In Experiment 1, the amount of reinforcement depended on the last two (reinforced or unreinforced) choices: defections preceded by cooperations produced the largest amount, the reverse sequence produced the smallest amount, and two cooperations in a row produced a larger amount than two defections in a row. Cooperation consisted of pecking on one of two response keys (left or right); pecking the other key was defection. Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1, but payoffs consisted of various delays to fixed amounts of food; cooperation and defection were defined as pecking on a symbol that could be projected on either the left or the right response key. Experiment 3 was similar to Experiment 2, but now the alternatives consisted of 'staying' (cooperating or defecting) or 'changing over' (from cooperation to defection, or vice-versa), and choices were effective only once every 1.3-s. In one condition, the color of the keys indicated whether a response on that key constituted a cooperation or a defection, and in a separate condition (also included in Experiment 1), the color of both keys indicated what the just-previous choice was. Results suggest that, contrary to previous evidence, pigeons may learn to cooperate in a prisoner's dilemma game when playing against tit-for-tat, and that the role of previous-choice signals is modulated by the parameters that define the payoff matrix.

"The relationship of behavioral, cognitive, and psychophysiological responses to a simulated marital interaction to husbands' intimate aggression was examined. A community sample of aggressive and non-aggressive couples completed an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma task in which they were led to believe that they were playing against each other, when actually all spouses were competing against a computerized opponent. Aggressive husbands were less likely to give cooperative responses in the game, were more difficult to train to be cooperative, were more likely to retaliate in response to a spousal defection, and were more likely to defect on trials that offered a large potential personal gain. An expected valence model showed that aggressive spouses played more selfishly, putting less weight on their spouses' potential gains on the task, relative to their own gains. Some evidence was found for greater physiological reactivity in spouses from aggressive relationships, with husbands showing greater heart rate reactivity and wives showing greater cortisol reactivity, in anticipation of the beginning of the task and after the completion of the task.

"The purpose of the present study was to extend the work of the author's master's thesis that tested implications derived from a theoretical analysis of structural solutions for the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma (NPD) game. Participants in the present study took part in one of two NPD games differing in payoff configuration, and received feedback about the choice behavior of other purported group members indicating that most of the others were cooperative or most were uncooperative. The two NPD games differed only in the payoff for cooperation; the payoff for defection and the social fine, or externality, were held constant. After playing one trial of the game, participants were given the opportunity to play one additional trial, either in the same laissez-faire manner as before (with no restrictions on choice behavior) or by adopting one of two structural solutions to the game (determining choices by majority rule or by a superordinate authority). The theoretical analysis that was tested suggests that different structural solutions should be preferred under the two different versions of the NPD. This prediction was not confirmed in the aforementioned master's thesis, nor, despite a number of methodological modifications, was it confirmed in the present study. To explore preferences for structural solutions further, a choice model was also examined. Some support was obtained for this model. Finally, the impact of social value orientation on choice behavior and preferences for structural solutions was assessed. The results demonstrated that social value orientation did not influence choice behavior or preferences for structural solutions. Possible explanations for the present findings were discussed.

"Edmondson's Team Learning Behaviors, which may drive team effectiveness, are preceded by Edmondson's mental model of safety. Safety is similar to the construct of interpersonal trust. This study tested whether or not a prisoner's dilemma game with different goal conditions would manipulate the level of between-team interpersonal trust. Further, would that manipulation then lead to different levels of Team Learning Behaviors and team effectiveness? The study involved 240 undergraduate students, participating in 40 six-person teams. Phase I involved each six-person group splitting up into two three-person teams. Half of the groups received the goal of maximizing points for their individual teams, while half of the groups received the goal of maximizing points for the entire group of participants. The manipulation led to a difference in the amount of between-team cooperation, and further, a difference in between-team trust. During phase II, the team of six participants was presented with a murder mystery game. The exercise contained 6 unshared clues that were unique to each of the six participants. Only through group discussion and the sharing of information could the unique clues be surfaced, which makes the game easier to solve. The goal manipulation did not lead to a difference in team learning behaviors (defined as Experimenting, Seeking Information, Asking Questions, Seeking Feedback, and Discussing Errors), nor to a difference in an overall team learning measure. Further, the manipulation did not result in different levels of team effectiveness. However, the manipulation did lead to self-reported differences in a desire to work together in the future, confusion during the murder mystery game, satisfaction with the game outcome, and satisfaction with their experience as a team member. The difficulty of testing a team learning model with newly formed vs. intact teams is discussed. The importance of individual differences, or a personality variable, is discussed as a potential covariate in a model of team learning. More research is needed to determine the necessary environmental and personality influences that create an abundance of Team Learning Behaviors. In today's fast paced market, the existence of Team Learning Behaviors may be the only sustainable source of competitive advantage. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Existing models of strategic decision making typically assume that only the attributes of the currently played game need be considered when reaching a decision. The results presented in this article demonstrate that the so-called 'cooperativeness' of the previously played prisoner's dilemma games influence choices and predictions in the current prisoner's dilemma game, which suggests that games are not considered independently. These effects involved reinforcement-based assimilation to the previous choices and also a perceptual contrast of the present game with preceding games, depending on the range and the rank of their cooperativeness. A. Parducci's (1965) range frequency theory and H. Helson's (1964) adaptation level theory are plausible theories of relative judgment of magnitude information, which could provide an account of these context effects.

"We tested the hypothesis that physically more attractive men are less likely to cooperate in social exchange than less attractive men, while physical attractiveness has no effect on women's tendency toward cooperation, with four different experimental games (Prisoner's Dilemma with 99 players, Allocator Choice with 77 players, Faith with 16 players, and Trust with 21 players). Pictures of the game players were taken after they participated in one of the four games, and those pictures were presented to another set of participants (85 raters in Study 1 and 2, 36 raters in Study 3) for attractiveness ratings. Both male and female raters who were unaware of the photographed game players' actual behavior in the game judged the faces of male defectors (who defected in one of the four games) to be more attractive than those of male cooperators, but they did not give differential attractiveness ratings to female defectors and female cooperators.

"A cross-societal experiment with 49 Australian and 56 Japanese participants examined if the group heuristic account of ingroup-favoring behavior in a Prisoner's Dilemma game can be extended beyond the minimal group situation to a situation involving an enduring social category (i.e. participant's nationality). Participants played a Prisoner's Dilemma game five times, each time with a different partner. Two of the five partners were ingroup members, two were outgroup members, and the nationality of one partner was not known. Furthermore, one of the two ingroup (or outgroup) partners knew that the participant was a member of the same (or the other) nationality, and the other did not know it. The results indicated that the knowledge that the partner had about the nationality of the participant exerted an effect only when the partner was an ingroup member. No major difference was found between Australian and Japanese participants. An outgroup-favoring cooperation pattern was observed, but that pattern was shown to be a result of fairness concerns among Australian participants and of positive stereotypes of Australians among Japanese participants.

"The current study examined the economics of cooperation in controlled-payoff games by using captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. This investigation used a special feeding apparatus to test for the stability of cooperative choice in a series of iterated games. The jays experienced experimentally determined game theoretical payoff matrices, which determined the distribution of food to themselves and their opponent, depending on their decision to cooperate or defect. The experiment tested four game matrices, called the cooperate only, defect only, prisoner's dilemma, and opponent control treatments. This study found little cooperation in the defect only and prisoner's dilemma treatments. Cooperation occurred significantly more often in the opponent control treatment. These findings suggest that the jays attend to short-term consequences; they do not cooperate in the absence of an immediate benefit (defect only), even if a long-term benefit may exist (prisoner's dilemma). The opponent control treatment suggests that cooperation can occur when an individual's benefits depend completely on the actions of others; therefore, generosity is cheap. This study, therefore, agrees with recent studies in proposing alternative models of cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The choice to cooperate or compete with others confronts us on a daily basis, and it is plausible that we use our mentalising skills to aid decision-making in such situations. We investigated the relationship between mentalising and decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), who show impaired mentalising, and normal adults. After completion of three versions of the prisoner's dilemma, we conducted a semi-structured interview. This interview attempted to elicit a participant's spontaneous strategy when playing each version of the game, as well as on their conception of the nature and strategy choice of their opponents (human vs. computer). Contrary to expectations, the behavioural choices of the adults with and without ASD were quantitatively similar, as were the qualitative responses to questions used in the interview. The consistency of the evidence from both measures suggests that mentalising ability was not involved in selecting the choices made in these prisoner's dilemma tasks. Instead they suggest the hypothesis that a purely logical strategy may have been adopted. The introspections of at least a subgroup of high-functioning individuals with ASD can on the whole be trusted and this use of mixed methods strengthens the validity of the conclusions drawn.

"We study a class of multi-level collective actions, in which each individual is simultaneously engaged in an intragroup conflict and intergroup competition. The intragroup conflict is modeled as an n-person Prisoner's Dilemma game, in which the dominant strategy is to contribute nothing. The intergroup competition is for an exogenous and commonly known prize shared by members of the winning group. We focus on the effects on the level of contribution of the two most common sharing rules for dividing the prize, equal and proportional. Our results show that (1) embedding the intragroup conflict in intergroup competition markedly reduces free riding; (2) the proportional profit sharing rule significantly outperforms the egalitarian rule, and the difference between the two increases with experience; (3) under egalitarian but not under proportional sharing, there is over-contribution compared to theoretical predictions, and (4) a simple reinforcement-based learning model accounts for the aggregate results of all five experimental conditions.

"Existing theories of social value orientations posit that prosocials maximize joint outcomes whereas proselfs maximize outcomes to themselves. Three studies employing a total of 157 undergraduates were conducted to test the alternative hypothesis that prosocials prefer equal outcomes to maximizing joint outcome. In study 1 participants completed the Triple-Dominance Measure of Social Values in which a fourth alternative that distributed the largest joint outcome unequally was added to the alternative that distributed the outcomes equally. In accordance with the hypothesis, prosocials preferred the equal-outcome alternative to the joint-outcome alternative. Study 2 confirmed and extended these results by demonstrating that prosocials preferred equal outcomes to larger joint outcomes that were unequally distributed but provided both with larger outcomes. Study 3 demonstrated that in a modified prisoner's dilemma game, a preference for equal outcomes to a larger joint outcome resulted in that prosocials cooperated when they believed or knew that the other cooperated, and defected when they believed or knew that the other defected.

"Recent work regarding the analysis of brain imaging data has focused on examining functional and effective connectivity of the brain. We develop a novel descriptive and inferential method to analyze the connectivity of the human brain using functional MRI (fMRI). We assess the relationship between pairs of distinct brain regions by comparing expected joint and marginal probabilities of elevated activity of voxel pairs through a Bayesian paradigm, which allows for the incorporation of previously known anatomical and functional information. We define the relationship between two distinct brain regions by measures of functional connectivity and ascendancy. After assessing the relationship between all pairs of brain voxels, we are able to construct hierarchical functional networks from any given brain region and assess significant functional connectivity and ascendancy in these networks. We illustrate the use of our connectivity analysis using data from an fMRI study of social cooperation among women who played an iterated 'Prisoner's Dilemma' game. Our analysis reveals a functional network that includes the amygdala, anterior insula cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, and another network that includes the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Our method can be used to develop causal brain networks for use with structural equation modeling and dynamic causal models. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Social memory plays a pivotal role in social behaviors, from mating behaviors to cooperative behaviors based on reciprocal altruism. More specifically, social/person recognition memory is supposed, by behavioral-economic and game-theoretic analysis, to be required for tit-for-tat like cooperative behaviors to evolve under the N-person iterated prisoner's dilemma game condition. Meanwhile, humans are known to show a social stress response during face-to-face social interactions, which might affect economic behaviors. Furthermore, it is known that there are individual differences in a social stress response, which might be reflected in individual differences in various types of economic behaviors, partially via different capacities of social memory. In the present study, we investigated the acute effects of social stress-induced free cortisol (a stress hormone) elevation on hippocampus-dependent social memory by utilizing the Trier social stress test (consisting of a public speech and a mental arithmetic task). We also examine the correlation between an economic behavior-related personality trait (i.e., general trust scale) and social stress-induced cortisol elevations. We found that (1) social stress acutely impairs social memory during social interaction and (2) interpersonal trust reduces social stress response. Together, interpersonal trust may modulate economic behaviors via stress hormone's action on social cognition-related brain regions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This article examines the relationship among conflict orientation, competitive bargaining, and unethical behavior. We report results from a negotiation study (N = 111 dyads) involving a 7-action prisoner's dilemma. We coded participants' conflict frames and their use of both competitive ethical tactics and deception. Our results demonstrate that negotiators' conflict frames influence the use of both types of behavior. While prior work has conceptualized competitive ethical tactics as distinct from unethical tactics (e.g., deception), our results suggest that in practice negotiators who adopt a competitive orientation use both types of tactics in tandem. We also examine the influence of deception on the bargaining process and outcomes. We find that the use of deception significantly distorts targets' beliefs, influences targets' decisions, increases deceivers' profits, and harms targets' profits. We discuss theoretical implications of these results and offer prescriptions for curtailing deception. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Mesencephalic dopamine neurons are believed to facilitate reward-dependent learning by computing errors in reward predictions. We used fMRI to test whether this system was activated as expected in response to errors in predictions about whether a social partner would reciprocate an act of altruism. Nineteen subjects received fMRI scans as they played a series of single-shot Prisoner's Dilemma games with partners who were outside the scanner. In both ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, reciprocated and unreciprocated cooperation were associated with positive and negative BOLD responses, respectively. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mesencephalic dopamine projection sites carry information about errors in reward prediction that allow us to learn who can and cannot be trusted to reciprocate favors.

"The authors administered measures of loneliness, generalized trust beliefs in peers, and trust beliefs in specific familiar peers (i.e., opposite-gender peers, same-gender peers, close same-gender peers) to a sample of 63 children (33 girls, 30 boys) from 4th and 5th grades (M age = 10 years, 6 months). They assessed children's trusting behavior by engaging them in a Prisoner's Dilemma game (reciprocal trusting) and by evaluating teachers' ratings. The authors found that, across gender, loneliness was negatively correlated with each measure of trust beliefs and trusting behavior. As expected, the relationship between children's loneliness and trust, specifically trust beliefs in same-gender peers, was stronger for girls than for boys. In support of an additive risk model, the authors found low trust beliefs in same-gender peers and low reciprocal trusting behavior with peers each statistically contributed to loneliness in girls.

"The purpose of this study was to examine the role of trust in relationships between temporary partners. In this study, we predicted that trust would play a 'signaling' role in promoting mutual cooperation, even in relationships with unfixed or temporary partners. To examine this prediction, we conducted an experiment using two different games. We used the repeated PD/D (prisoner's dilemma with choice of dependence) game, which can measure trusting behavior independently from cooperation. Also, we used the ordinary PD game in which there is no option for trust. Seventy participants were assigned to either the PD/D condition or the ordinary PD condition. In both conditions, players interacted with a randomly matched partner in each trial. The results reveal that the cooperation rate in the PD/D game was significantly higher than that in the PD game. Such a finding indicates that trust serves as a signal of the player's intention, which in turn, promotes mutual cooperation. However, in a similar experiment in which players interacted with the same partner, Matsuda & Yamagishi (2001) found a much lower cooperation rate in the PD/D condition than what was found in this experiment. Therefore, we conclude that the role of trust in non-fixed relationships has only a limited effect for promoting mutual cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Three experiments examined the extent to which an implicit (Implicit Association Test [IAT]) and an explicit (Pro-Black/Anti-Black Attitudes Questionnaire [PAAQ]) measure of racial attitudes predicted both spontaneous and deliberative social behaviors. In Experiment 1, the IAT and PAAQ were used to predict the amount of cooperation exhibited by White participants in a Prisoner's Dilemma game (PDG) when the (fictitious) partner was either Caucasian or African American. In Experiment 2, the two measures were used to predict the extent to which White participants mimicked the motor movements of Caucasian and African American confederates. Finally, in Experiment 3, the two measures were used to predict the verbal and nonverbal behaviors of White participants engaged in dyadic conversations with Caucasian and African American confederates. The primary findings of the three experiments reported herein are: (a) participants cooperated more with a Black partner in the PDG; (b) both the IAT and the Pro-Black subscale of the PAAQ predicted cooperation with the Black partner; (c) participants exhibited greater mimicry of a White confederate; (d) both the IAT and the Pro-Black subscale predicted mimicry of the Black confederate; (e) participants exhibited more friendly verbal and nonverbal behaviors when interacting with a White confederate; (f) the IAT primarily predicted friendliness of nonverbal behaviors with the White confederate relative to the Black confederate; and (g) the Pro-Black subscale primarily predicted friendliness of verbal behaviors with the Black confederate.

"Interpersonal trust is widely considered to be a key success factor in most personal, intra- and inter-organizational relationships. The hypothetical model of interpersonal trust that is popular in management science includes specific trust, which is particular to the situation, task and person to be trusted, and general trust, which is a stable personality factor. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of general trust by addressing two questions: first, how does a person make decisions to trust or withhold trust from a stranger and, second, does a person's level of general trust affect his trust-related decision-making process and, if so, how? General trust was conceived and operationalized as comprising two factors, dispositional trust and caution. Designed as an exploratory study, with a theoretical sample of fifteen graduate students, the investigation employed the Problem-Centered Interview, a grounded theory method. In a laboratory setting, each participant was interviewed while he played the Trust Game, a sequential-play version of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, with a partner whom he had no opportunity to meet or communicate with other than to signal his moves in the game. Each participant played two games, each with a different partner. Pre- and post-test questionnaires, including a general trust instrument, provided complementary data on the participants' levels of dispositional trust and caution, goals, demographics and other relevant factors. The study produced an intricate set of data which was organized into a structural model of the general trust-based decision-making process. When examined on a case-by-case basis, the data showed that the high-, medium- and low-trusters differed in how they conceived the situation, what considerations were important to them, what meanings they construed from the information available, what decisions they made and how they behaved. These factors clustered into four identifiable approaches to decision-making that were characteristic of participants with different levels of trust. Overall, the findings of the study suggest that an individual's level of general trust has a far greater influence on his decision-making behavior than has been supposed or concluded in most organizational trust research. This has implications for future research, management education and organizational practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"We explore the neural underpinnings of gender differences in cooperation and their modulation by intensive media watching. We compared cooperative decisions and electroencephalograph data between genders from who participated in repeated rounds of the public goods game (PGG) and investigated within groups changes that occurred after watching a TV program known as 'investigative reporting' that denounces unfair advantages taken by free-riders against the public. Women tended to be more cooperative than men during early rounds of PGG, mostly because they react differently to the defection of others; women also had greater β and γ band activity in regions estimated to be associated with social cognition. These gender differences disappeared after participants watched the TV programs: women were more likely to choose free-riding in response to the defection of others that elicits significant increases in γ band activities that were estimated to be right insula. Greater activity in social cognition leads women to make decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make a decision by complying with the social norm. Watching the investigative TV reports produced a greater negative emotion to the defection and led women, in a similar manner as men, to opt for a 'tit-for-tat' strategy.

"We demonstrate that receiver credulity can be understood through a false consensus effect: the likelihood with which individuals believe messages about the behavior of others can be explained by their own behavioral tendencies in a comparable situation. In a laboratory experiment, subjects play a public good game with punishment in which feedback on actual contributions is obscured. Instead, subjects communicate what they have contributed through a post hoc announcement mechanism. Using subjects’ social value orientation as a proxy for their contribution tendency, we show that those high on the measure have inflated beliefs about the contribution of others. This, in turn, impacts their contribution and punishment decisions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"It is argued that trust and positive social preferences promote public goods production. However, public goods produced by any in-group may have favourable or unfavourable consequences for out-groups (called ‘benign’ and ‘malignant’ public goods, respectively).

The results allow four general conclusions: (i) contributions to benign public goods are (weakly) higher than contributions to malignant ones; (ii) general trust is at best weakly related to contributions to both types of public goods; (iii) the expectation that others contribute is positively related to contributions to both types of public goods; and (iv) social preferences are positively related to contributions to benign public goods and unrelated to contributions to malignant public goods, while ingroup bias is negatively related to contributions to both public goods.

Results seem to support the hypothesis that cooperation is instinctive, while defection is ‘rational’. Moreover, as the experiment is designed also to assess the effects of the consumption of relational goods on cooperation, we are also able to state that some types of relational goods, like team working, produce additional cooperation, but make it less spontaneous. We also detect that females seem to behave less instinctively than males. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Economic game experiments have become a prominent method among social scientists developing and testing theories of cooperation. These games provide a valuable opportunity to generate measures of cooperation that can be compared from one place to the next, yet challenges remain in how to interpret cross-cultural differences in these experiments and connect them to cooperation in naturally occurring contexts. I address these challenges by examining framing effects in public goods games (PGGs) with salmon fishers and reindeer herders in Kamchatka, Russia. Combining standard versions of the game with versions that refer to post-Soviet institutions coordinating fishing and herding, I show that (1) average contributions in the PGG in Kamchatka are substantially higher than reported elsewhere and (2) framing the PGG alters the relationship between contributions and expectations, shifting strategies away from unconditional generosity and toward conditional cooperation. My analysis, by synthesizing quantitative analysis of PGG data with long-term qualitative ethnography, including extensive postgame interviews with participants, supports the notion that cooperation in economic games increases along with cultural norms, values, and institutions that emerge from economic interdependence. Framing effects suggest that researchers should devote more attention to investigating the relationship between contributions and expectations.

Our experimental results show that (1) the level of cooperation is indistinguishable between the punishment and reward treatments when group membership does not change, but the reward treatment shows stronger endgame effects and that (2) punishment is much more effective than reward when group membership changes randomly between rounds. Strategic motivations are stronger in rewarding others, whereas more intrinsic motivations drive punishment behavior.

"Background: The literature on social dilemmas and punishment focuses on the behaviour of the punisher. However, to fully explain the effect of punishment on cooperation, it is important to understand the psychological mechanisms influencing the behaviour of those who expect to be punished. This paper examines whether the expectation of punishment, rather than the implementation of punishment is sufficient to prevent individuals from free riding. Individual differences in the punishment sensitivity have been linked to both threat responses (flight, fight, fear system, or the FFFS) and to the response to the uncertainty of punishment (BIS-anxiety).The paper, therefore, examines if individual differences in BIS-anxiety and FFFS can explain some of the variability in free riding in the face of implemented and non-implemented punishment. Methods: Participants took part in a series of one-shot Public Goods Games (PGGs) facing two punishment conditions (implemented and non-implemented) and two standard non-punishment PGGs. The punishment was implemented as a centralized authority punishment (i.e., if one participant contributed less than their group members, they were automatically fined). Individual contribution levels and presence/absence of zero contributions indexed free riding. Individual differences in behavioural inhibition were assessed. Results: Individuals contributed more under the threat of punishment (both implemented and non-implemented). However, individuals contributed less when the punishment was not implemented compared to when it was. Those scoring high in BIS-anxiety contributed more when the punishment expectations were not implemented. This effect was not observed for FFFS. Conclusion: Supporting previous research, punishment had a powerful effect in increasing contribution levels in the PGGs. However, when expected punishment was not implemented, individual differences in punishment sensitivity, specifically in BIS-anxiety, were related to fewer contributions (increased free riding) as compared to the situation when punishment was not implemented. This has implications for our understanding of why some people cannot resist the temptation to free ride, even when facing possible punishment for their actions. Our findings suggest that the diminished functioning of mechanisms, associated with trait behavioural inhibition, can partly explain such behaviours.

"It has become an accepted paradigm that humans have 'prosocial preferences' that lead to higher levels of cooperation than those that would maximize their personal financial gain. However, the existence of prosocial preferences has been inferred post hoc from the results of economic games, rather than with direct experimental tests. Here, we test how behavior in a public-goods game is influenced by knowledge of the consequences of actions for other players. We found that (i) individuals cooperate at similar levels, even when they are not informed that their behavior benefits others; (ii) an increased awareness of how cooperation benefits others leads to a reduction, rather than an increase, in the level of cooperation; and (iii) cooperation can be either lower or higher than expected, depending on experimental design. Overall, these results contradict the suggested role of the prosocial preferences hypothesis and show how the complexity of human behavior can lead to misleading conclusions from controlled laboratory experiments.

"We use a two-person public goods experiment to investigate how much agents value conditional cooperation when symmetric positive contributions entail efficiency losses. Asymmetric marginal per capita returns allow only the high-productivity player to increase group payoffs when contributing positive amounts. Asymmetric contributions, however, yield unequal individual payoffs. To assess a priori cooperative preferences, we measure individual 'value-orientations' by means of the decomposed game technique. We find that contributions remain negligible throughout the experiment, suggesting that people are not willing to contribute positive amounts if this may lead to damage efficiency.

"Schizophrenia is generally characterized by various positive and negative symptoms that are accompanied by significant social dysfunction. Various researchers investigated the functional impairments in schizophrenia including impaired theory of mind (TOM), poor integration of affective and cognitive information, and malfunctioning of adaptive and strategic learning process. However, most of the studies were limited to simplified cognitive tests or computerized choice games that exclude real social interaction. The aim of the current study was to investigate human strategies based on the incentives and particularly the cognitive and emotional motivations of free riding. We examined the decision patterns of 41 healthy subjects (HSs) and 37 schizophrenia patients (SZ) during the public goods game (PGG), one of the games simulating human cooperation and free riding in group interactions. Strategic decision processes during the iterative binary PGG were assessed in terms of cognitive understanding, loss sensitivity, and TOM. We found that greed and loss sensitivity both motivated free-riding behavior in the HS, but that they were more vulnerable to greedy incentives than to possible loss. More significantly, the SZ clearly displayed a lower prevalence of free riding and distinct decision patterns from HS. Nonstrategic and unexpectedly low free ridings in the SZ likely arise from poor integration of cognitive and affective information. We suggest that loss sensitivity and TOM as well as cognitive understanding are involved in regulation of the free riding and cooperative behavior.

"Economic games are often used in an attempt to reveal the underlying preferences or motivations that govern human behaviour. However, this approach relies on the implicit assumption that individuals are rational and fully aware of the consequences of their decisions. We examined behaviour in a standard economic game that is often used to measure social preferences: the public-goods game. We found that giving information to individuals about the relative success of their group led to (1) significantly higher levels of cooperation and (2) emotional responses to group success. This is despite the fact that group success had no effect on the payoffs in our game, and so knowledge of group success should not influence the behaviour of rational players. Consequently, these results suggest that cues of group competition have an automatic or unconscious effect on human behaviour that can induce increased within-group cooperation. More generally, this framing effect emphasizes the potential problem with drawing biological conclusions from the quantitative comparison of cooperation levels in economic games with the predictions of theory. Instead, our results emphasize the advantage of testing theory by qualitatively comparing behaviour across treatments, and with regard to expected adaptations and expected ontogeny.

"Based on a simple theoretical framework, we show that when individuals exhibit positional, prosocial or conformist preferences which are endogenous, the end outcomes in terms of private provision of public goods can differ significantly from traditional neo-classical predictions. Indeed, when a given individual selects a specific subset of preferences according to what others do, he/she will contribute positively to the public good provision. We provide anecdotal evidence to support our theoretical analysis by using data from an Internet survey on a sample of French individuals. Analyses of individual responses confirm our theoretical arguments. For instance, we show that relative concerns matter, that is, for several environmental goods, people might prefer polluting more in absolute terms but less than others in society. Moreover, we also test whether people exhibit a social desirability bias and show that they attribute more (less) positional (prosocial) concerns to others in society.

"Objective: Irrelevant information, such as one's Social Security number, has been shown to influence decisions in experiments. The objective of this article is to investigate this anchoring effect with respect to the randomly assigned participant number in an economic experiment. Methods: The game is a public good contribution game. In one session, participants write their participant number on their decision sheet while this number is printed on the decision sheet in the remaining sessions. Anchoring with respect to participant number suggests that those with higher participant numbers contribute more than those with low participant numbers. Results: I find no evidence of anchoring. In each session, the mean contribution is not significantly different across different partitioning of the subjects according to participant numbers. Conclusions: Social scientists using experimental methods in research are unlikely to bias results by assigning participant numbers when these numbers coincide with the decision space of the games played.

"Twenty-four laboratory sessions were conducted to evaluate the roles of communication and group heterogeneity when voluntary contributions determine the level of public good provision by small groups of individuals. Simple heterogeneity has one individual in a group having either greater endowment of resources or a greater preference for the public good than the others. Complex heterogeneity has one individual in a group having both higher endowment and greater preference for the public good. Without communication, members of heterogeneous groups tend to coordinate more on equal contribution shares than predicted by the conventional public goods model but consistent with a model incorporating a preference for equity. The distribution of relative contributions and total payoffs within groups exhibit strong interactions between communication and heterogeneity, leading to less equitable distributions of payoffs as heterogeneity becomes more complex. A model of equity theory helps to organize the results. Results suggest that communication may refocus the objective of group members. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"People regularly free ride on collective benefits, consuming them without contributing to their creation. In response, free riders are often moralized, becoming targets of negative moral judgments, anger, ostracism, or punishment. Moralization can change free riders’ behavior (e.g., encouraging them to contribute or discouraging them from taking future benefits) or it can motivate others, including moralizers, to avoid or exclude free riders; these effects of moralization are critical to sustaining human cooperation. Based on theories of error management and fundamental social domains from evolutionary psychology, we propose that the decision to moralize is a cue-driven process. One cue investigated in past work is observing a person illicitly consume collective benefits. Here, we test whether the mind uses a 2nd cue: merely opting out of contributing. Use of this cue creates a phenomenon of preventive moralization: moralization of people who have not yet exploited collective benefits but who might—or might not—in the future. We tested for preventive moralization across 9 studies using implicit and explicit measures of moralization, a behavioral measure of costly punishment, mediation analyses of the underlying processes, and a nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 U.S. adults. Results revealed that merely opting out of contributing to the creation of exploitable collective benefits—despite not actually exploiting collective benefits—elicited moralization. Results further showed that preventive moralization is not due to the moralization of selfishness or deviance but instead follows from the uncertainty inherent in moralization decisions. These results imply that even people who will never exploit collective benefits can nonetheless be targets of moralization. We discuss implications for social and political dynamics.

"Insights from sexual selection and costly signalling theory suggest that competition for females underlies men’s public good contributions. We conducted two public good experiments to test this hypothesis. First, we found that men contributed more in the presence of an opposite sex audience, but there was no parallel effect for the women. In addition, men’s public good contributions went up as they rated the female observer more attractive. In the second experiment, all male groups played a five round public good game and their contributions significantly increased over time with a female audience only. In this condition men also volunteered more time for various charitable causes. These findings support the idea that men compete with each other by creating public goods to impress women. Thus, a public good is the human equivalent of a peacock’s tail. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This paper presents an experimental comparison of single and multiple-prize all-pay auctions as fundraising mechanisms to finance public goods. We consider a setting characterized by heterogenous incomes and incomplete information, where single and multiple-prize incentive mechanisms are predicted to raise the same overall contribution, but different contributions by income level. We find that overall, for a given total prize sum, a single large prize generates higher contributions to the public good than three smaller prizes. As predicted by the theory, a single prize provides a more effective incentive for high-income individuals. However, contrary to the theoretical predictions, multiple prizes do not provide a more effective incentive for low-income individuals. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Theory of mind and individual preferences are important determinants in social decision making. Using a large sample, this study examined whether being a cooperative preference type is related to better theory of mind skills. Furthermore, by testing adolescents and adults, we examined the impact of age on this relationship. Theory of mind is measured in a Public Goods Game. The results indicate that the cooperative type predicted other players’ preference types more accurately in the first round of the Public Goods Game. Regarding age differences, cooperative adults more accurately estimated the behavior of players of the same type compared with cooperative adolescents. Adolescents exhibited lower cooperation levels and a slower adaption of behavior than adults, indicating that theory of mind continues to develop throughout adolescence.

"According to the Greek philosopher Plato '[…] if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the State […] may be allowed to lie for the public good' (The Royal Lie). To investigate whether The Royal Lie may foster cooperation in public goods provision we experimentally study centralized manipulations of contribution feedback. We find that a uniform feedback exaggeration does not increase cooperation and is disapproved once it is disclosed. An individual exaggeration, however, that gives nobody the feeling of being a sucker sustains cooperation on a high level. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We provide experimental evidence on the theory of club goods. Subjects played what we call ‘the club game’—that is, a two-stage game: at the first stage, each player announces her favourite club size. Depending on the profile of announced club sizes, each player either joins a club of her favourite size or stays alone. At the second stage, club members play some kind of non-linear public goods game exhibiting the property that certain club sizes favour cooperation, and hence the payoffs for the players. Among other hypotheses, the central idea of club theory can be tested this way: A population of actors should partition itself in clubs of optimal size. As it turns out, this hypothesis can be validated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In a step-level public-good experiment, we investigate how the order of moves (simultaneous vs. sequential) and the number of step levels (one vs. two) affects public-good provision in a two-player game. We find that the sequential order of moves significantly improves public-good provision and payoffs, even though second movers often punish first movers who give less than half of the threshold contribution. The additional second step level—which is not feasible in standard Nash equilibrium—leads to higher contributions but does not improve public-good provision and lowers payoffs. We calibrate the parameters of Fehr and Schmidt’s model of inequality aversion to make quantitative predictions. We find that actual behavior fits remarkably well with several predictions in a quantitative sense. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"When a legislature bargains over funds for pork and public goods, and the funds come from a common budget, increased spending on the public good means greater payoff equality since it comes at the expense of pork. This paper explores whether inequity aversion then leads to greater public goods spending. Using both theory and a laboratory experiment we show inequity aversion generally decreases inequity within a coalition by limiting proposer power. However, this does not always mean greater public goods contributions because the types of proposals passed change in equilibrium. In addition, the experiment investigates the theoretical prediction that increasing players’ relative preference for pork can increase public goods contributions. We show that while average public goods contributions remain unchanged, there is evidence at the individual level that subjects hold out for higher public goods contributions as predicted.

"We report the results from a series of public goods games in which the racial composition of the group was exogenously varied. Contrary to predictions from social psychology, we find that visible racial homogeneity in a group does not uniformly predict higher contributions to the public account. Rather, our results suggest that in homogenous groups, observable racial identity may convey information about heterogeneity in other dimensions, especially where race is highly correlated with diversity in other dimensions, such as linguistic diversity, low intra-group trust and socio-economic need. Thus, racial identity loses its salience in the absence of any visibly identifiable out-group members, but other dimensions of identity increase their salience. Moreover, while communication has a large and significant positive effect on contributions to the public pool, patterns of communication are affected by the racial composition of the group.

"We replicate Andreoni (Quarterly Journal of Economics 110: 1–21, 1995)’s finding that agents behave more selfishly when taking from a public account than when giving to a public good. Based on a neutral language setting we add new insights into motivations to give or take in a linear public good setting: we find that Andreoni’s result is partly driven by the complete elimination of giving options in the taking frame. However, a pure extension of the action space into the taking domain also leads to a significant increase in selfish behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A laboratory experiment where human subjects play a repeated public goods game with high-powered punishment technology (50:1). Results on three attributes are similar to lower-powered punishment settings (e.g., 3:1): Subjects contribute almost 100 % to the public good, punishment rates are low (under 10 % of maximum), and punishment is directed more toward low contributors. In contrast to lower-powered punishment settings, however, subjects earn less money than they would have in the same setting without punishment. These results contribute to the debate about the origins and maintenance of cooperation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This paper studies contributions and punishments in a linear public good game, where group members have different sources of endowment. We compare the behavior of homogeneous groups, in which subjects are exogenously assigned the same endowments, with that of heterogeneous groups, in which half the group members have to exert effort to earn their endowments (effort subjects) and the other half are endowed with a windfall of equal value (windfall subjects). If the opportunity to punish is absent, free-riding becomes the ubiquitous form of behavior over time both in homogeneous and in heterogeneous groups. If the opportunity to punish is present, contributions increase over time, although the two groups do not exhibit any differences in either the amount of contributions or the amount of punishment. Furthermore, effort and windfall subjects make similar contributions in heterogeneous groups. Within the heterogeneous groups, over the entire time interval and conditional on the decision to punish, effort subjects punish (slightly) less severely than those who received windfall endowments.

"Previous research demonstrates that individuals vary in their social preferences. Less well-understood is how group composition affects the behavior of different social preference types. Does one bad apple really spoil the bunch? This paper exogenously identifies experimental participants’ social preferences, then systematically assigns individuals to homogeneous or heterogeneous groups to examine the impact of ‘bad apples’ on cooperation and efficiency. Consistent with previous research, we find that groups with more selfish types achieve lower levels of efficiency. We identify two mechanisms for the effect. First, the selfish players contribute less. Second, selfish players induce lower contributions from the conditional cooperators, and this effect increases in the number of selfish players. These results are not sensitive to information about the distribution of types in the group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We study a dynamic auction mechanism in the context of private provision of a discrete public good under incomplete information. The bidders have private valuations, and the cost of the public good is common knowledge. No bidder is willing to provide the good on her own. We show that a natural application of open ascending auctions in such environments fails dramatically: The probability of provision is zero in any equilibrium. The mechanism effectively auctions off the ‘right’ to be the last one to contribute, but intuition suggests that neither player wishes to be the last one to contribute. Since the player who contributes first has the advantage of being able to free ride on the contributions of the other players, no player wants to ‘win’ the auction.

"When public goods can only be provided when donations cross a minimum threshold, this creates an advantage in that Pareto Efficient outcomes can be Nash Equilibria. Despite this, experiments have shown that groups struggle to coordinate on one of the many efficient equilibria. We apply a mechanism used successfully in continuous public goods games, the Hired Gun Mechanism (Andreoni and Gee in J. Public Econ. 96(11–12):1036–1046, 2012), to see if it can successfully get subjects across the threshold. When we use the mechanism to eliminate only inefficient equilibria, without addressing coordination, there is a modest but statistically insignificant improvement with the mechanism. However, when we hone the mechanism to eliminate all but one of the provision-point equilibria, thereby addressing the coordination issue, the mechanism moves all subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost immediately. In fact, after only one round using the hired gun mechanism, all subject are coordinating on the chosen equilibrium. The mechanism can be applied in settings where a group (1) has a plan for public good provision, (2) can measure contributions, (3) can fine members and (4) has an agreed upon standard for expected contributions. In these settings simple punishments, when focused on solving coordination as well as free riding, can greatly improve efficiency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Previous research provides compelling evidence that defaults affect individual behaviour in several domains. However, evidence of their influence in strategic interaction is scant. We experimentally investigate the effect of defaults on contributions to a public good and attempt to shed light on potential channels through which they operate. Our main experimental findings show that defaults influence contribution behaviour: preference for a suggested contribution significantly increases when it is presented as the default. However, this effect seems not to operate primarily through information conveyance or expectations about others’ behaviour. Default contributions, thus, appear to have an attractive power that goes beyond recommendation signals and expectation influences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This paper investigates whether providing strong cooperation incentives only at the outset of a group interaction spills over to later periods to ensure cooperation in the long run. We study a repeated linear public-good game with punishment opportunities and a parameter change after the first ten (of twenty) rounds. Our data shows that cooperation among subjects who had experienced a higher marginal return on public-good contributions or low punishment costs in rounds 1–10 rapidly deteriorated in rounds 11–20 once these incentives were removed, eventually trending below the level of cooperation in the control group. This suggests the possibility of temporary incentives backfiring in the long run. This paper ties in with the literature highlighting the potentially adverse effects of the use of incentives.

"We study the role of social identity in determining the impact of social fragmentation on public good provision using laboratory experiments. We find that as long as there is some degree of social fragmentation, increasing it leads to lower public good provision by majority group members. This is mainly because the share of those in the majority group who contribute fully to the public good diminishes with social fragmentation, while the share of free-riders is unchanged. This suggests social identity preferences drive our result, as opposed to self-interest. Importantly, we find no difference in contribution between homogeneous and maximally-fragmented treatments, reinforcing our finding that majority groups contribute most in the presence of some diversity.

"We experimentally investigate the impact of recognizing contributors on public good contributions. We vary recognizing all, highest or lowest contributors. Consistent with previous studies, recognizing all contributors significantly increases contributions relative to the baseline. Recognizing only the highest contributors does not increase contributions compared to not recognizing contributors, while recognizing only the lowest contributors is as effective as recognizing all contributors. These findings support our conjecture that aversion from shame is a more powerful motivator for giving than anticipation of prestige. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We investigate how burden sharing rules impact the voluntary provision of a public good which generates heterogeneous benefits to agents. We compare different rule-based contribution schemes where agents can first suggest a minimum provision level of the public good, before the smallest common denominator is implemented. We find that rule-based contribution schemes significantly increase payoff levels relative to the VCM, while significant differences exist between the rules. Importantly, the equal-payoff rule maximizes payoffs for all player types. This also holds relative to a scheme where different types of players separately can determine their minimum contribution levels. Our results lend insights into the efficient institutional design for voluntary private provision of public goods, and how burden sharing rules interact with efficiency when agents are heterogeneous.

"The notions of one's social identity and group membership have recently become topics for economic theory and experiments, and recent research has shown the importance of identity in a wide array of economic environments. But predictions are unclear when there is some trade-off between one's identity (e.g., race, gender, handedness) and potential monetary considerations. We conduct a public-goods experiment in which we permit endogenous group-formation. In a 2 × 2 design, we vary whether people participate in a team-building exercise and whether some people receive an endowment twice as much as others receive. We find that when both identity and financial considerations are present, high-endowment participants are strongly attracted to each other, with one's word-task-group affiliation eclipsed by the opportunity to earn more. Nevertheless, the team-building exercise greatly increases the level of contribution whether or not one is linked to people from one's team-building exercise.

"Favor trading is common. We do something nice for someone and they do something nice in return. Several motives might underlie such behavior, including altruism, strategic motives, and direct or indirect positive reciprocity. It is not yet well-understood how these fit together to affect behavior, how they interact in various institutional structures, and how they play out over time. We use a laboratory experiment to study the elements and dynamics of favor trading in a particular setting: the private provision of a public good. In our experiment, giving subjects the ability to practice targeted reciprocity by making a simple, low-cost change in information provision increases contributions to the public good by 14 %. Subjects reward group members who have previously been generous to them and withhold rewards from ungenerous group members. Strategic concerns cannot explain all of this behavior, and it must be at least partly due to direct reciprocity. When someone cannot directly benefit from favor trading, he gives much less to the public good. People thus excluded from the 'circle of reciprocity' provide a clean and strict test of indirect reciprocity. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, we do not observe indirect reciprocity.

"Subjects in public good experiments are often observed to be more cooperative than subjects in common pool resource experiments. This cooperation divergence may be explained by a behavioral asymmetry between the warm-glow of doing something good and the cold-prickle of doing something bad (Andreoni, 1995). However, recent research suggests that behavior is qualitatively similar across payoff equivalent public good and common pool resource experiments (Apesteguia & Maier-Rigaud, 2006). This paper reports on an experiment designed to test the robustness of the cooperation divergence. The analysis quantifies the cooperation across payoff equivalent public good and common pool resource experiments that explicitly inform subjects how their allocation decisions effect group earnings. Results suggest that the level of cooperation is equivalent across treatments. This research suggests that the observed cooperation divergence is caused, in part, by variation in the experimental parameters employed rather than from a behavioral regularity unexplained by standard theory.

"The relationship between norms, self-sanctioning, and people’s decisions about contributing to public goods is complex and often misunderstood in the public goods literature. We develop a model in which individuals self-sanction (e.g. feel guilty) for contributing less than a subjective norm level of contribution to a public good. From the model we derive the following testable hypotheses: an increase in one’s perception of the norm level of contribution to the public good (1) induces negative self sanctioning and (2) will lead one to contribute more to the public good, and (3) that contributing to the public good induces positive self-sanctioning. To test these hypotheses, we elicit stated preferences for contributions to an organization which offsets carbon emissions and a proxy for self-sanctioning, respondent 'self-image.' We fail to reject each hypothesis. Our results complement existing studies on how to encourage contributions to the public good. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We test a mechanism whereby groups are formed voluntarily, through the use of voting. These groups play a public-goods game, where efficiency increases with group size (up to a limit, in one treatment). It is feasible to exclude group members, to exit one's group, or to form larger groups through mergers involving the consent of both merging groups. We find a great degree of success for this mechanism, as the average contribution rate is very high. The driving force appears to be the economies of scale combined with the awareness that bad behavior will result in exclusion or no admission. However, an important additional component is that it is possible for previous outsiders to later redeem themselves by becoming high contributors, typically in efficient large groups.

"This paper investigates a novel public goods game where contributions to the public goods require effort that is observable. When the players are observed, they exert more effort to contribute to the public goods, and free-riding diminishes significantly compared to the no observer case. These effects are absent when no effort is required in order to contribute to the public goods. Furthermore, in the presence of an audience, the contributions to the public goods do not diminish when the game is repeated in the effort-required environment. Being observed does not affect the performance of the players if there is no strategic aspect of the game, in other words, when they play a private goods game. These results indicate that an individual wants to avoid appearing lazy when her effort helps the society. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A voluntary blood donation system can be seen as a public good. People can take advantage without contributing and have a free ride. We empirically analyse the extent of free riding and its determinants. Interviews of the general public in Spain (n = 1,211) were used to ask whether respondents were (or have been) regular blood donors and, if not, the reason. Free riders are defined as those who are medically capable to donate blood but do not. In addition, we distinguish four different types of free riding depending on the reason given for not donating. Binomial and multinomial logit models estimate the effect of individual characteristics on the propensity to free ride and the likelihood of the free rider types. Amongst those who are able to donate, there is a 67 % probability of being a free rider. The most likely free rider is female, single, with low/no education and abstained from voting in a recent national election. Gender, age, religious practice, political participation and regional income explain the type of free rider. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In this chapter, we present experimental results from the dictator game (DG), the strategy method ultimatum game (UG), the public goods game (PG), and the trust game. We find the highest levels of prosociality in our world sample. The striking finding from these games is that this rural U.S. population demonstrated consistently high prosociality across all measures in all games: offers, returns, and rejections of low offers at cost to the individual. Indeed, in the DG (mean offer = 47 percent) and the UG (mean offer = 48 percent), because there was virtually no variation in offer behavior, it is not possible to test for any demographic effects. Consistent with the high prosocial behavior that we observe in the offers across all four games, we also find high rejection rates in the strategy method UG, with close to 30 percent of the sample rejecting offers of 40 percent. From the PG, we see overall high offers (mean = 62 percent), and perhaps even more impressive, 36 percent of the population contributed 100 percent of their stake to the common pot. In the trust game, we have evidence of both considerable trust (high player 1 offers of 63 percent) and considerable trustworthiness (high player 2 returns of 173 percent). These findings are particularly interesting because they come from a rural population of relatively modest economic means: 12 percent of the sample had household incomes below the U.S. poverty line. Given that this rural Missouri population is also in the midwestern Bible Belt, with near-universal belief in a world religion, these findings are directly in line with the overall results of this volume. This population has highly developed market institutions, its religious orientation is toward a world religion, and it demonstrated consistently high prosociality across a range of diverse experiments.

"We study the effects of reward and punishment as instruments for leadership in sequential public goods games. In particular, we embed reward and punishment into a broad research project that investigates the effects of leadership in the provision of public goods by examining (i) the relative importance of reward and punishment as leadership devices, (ii) whether endogenous leadership is more efficient than exogenously enforced leadership, and (iii) whether leaders contributing last, instead of first, also increase contributions. The experimental results are; (i) Reward options yield lower contributions than punishment through exclusion, (ii) Endogenous leadership is much more efficient than exogenously imposed leadership, (iii) Having sequential contributions of group members is not beneficial in itself for contributions since groups where the leader contributes as the last member do not contribute more than groups without a leader. As such, these results illuminate the relative benefits of reward arid punishment as instruments for leaders. Yet, while these instruments seem to increase the hierarchical power of the leader, volunteering to be the leader of the group—thereby sacrificing own payoffs to achieve a common goal—seems to increase his persuasive, power to convince the followers to contribute to the public good. This happens due to a selection bias—more cooperative members volunteer to be leaders—and due to a stronger response of followers to a voluntary leader than to an externally imposed leader This has immediate implications for organizations.

"In the recent literature, several hypotheses have been offered to explain patterns of human behavior in social environments. In particular, these patterns include ‘prosocial’ ones, such as fairness, cooperation, and collective good provision. Psychologists suggest that these prosocial behaviors are driven not by miscalculations, but by salience of social identity, ingroup favoritism, emotion, or evolutionary adaptations. This paper imports psychology scholarship into an economic model and results in a sustainable solution to collective action problems without any external enforcement mechanisms.

In this paper I test the hypothesis that imperfect sanctions may nonetheless serve a forward looking purpose if sufficiently many individuals are averse against advantageous inequity. Using a linear public good with centralized punishment, I find that participants increase contributions even if severity had been insufficient to deter a profit-maximizing individual. The more an individual is averse against exploiting others, the less it matters whether punishment was deterrent. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Four studies utilizing different methodological approaches investigated adult age-related differences in altruism (i.e., contributions to the public good) and the self-centered value of increasing personal wealth. In Study 1, data from the World Values Survey (World Values Survey Association, 2009) provided 1st evidence of a negative association between age and the self-reported wish to be rich. Ecological concerns, a form of contributing to the public good, were positively related to age. Study 2 investigated whether these values are expressed behaviorally when participants solved a complex problem that allowed striving for monetary gains or contributing to a public good. Confirming hypotheses, young adults’ strategies were consistent with the aim of optimizing personal financial gain, and older adults’ strategies with the aim to contribute to the public good. Studies 3 and 4 showed that older adults were more likely than younger and middle-aged adults to donate money to a good cause than to keep it for themselves. Study 4 manipulated participants’ future time perspective as a factor potentially contributing to age-related differences. Partly confirming hypotheses, a longer time perspective reduced donations by older adults, but a shorter time perspective did not increase donations by younger adults. These studies suggest that older adults not only report valuing contributions to the public good more highly but also are more likely to behave altruistically than younger adults. All studies used cross-sectional designs that prevent a strict test of developmental trajectories but rather provide age-related differences at 1 point in time, representing a 1st step in investigating adult age-related differences in altruism.

"We propose the minimum approval mechanism (MAM) for a standard linear public good environment with two players. Players simultaneously and privately choose their contributions to the public good in the first stage. In the second stage, they simultaneously decide whether to approve the other’s choice. Both contribute what they choose in the first stage if both players approve; otherwise, both contribute the minimum of the two choices in the first stage. The MAM implements the Pareto-efficient allocation in multiple solution concepts including backward elimination of weakly dominated strategies (BEWDS), limit logit agent quantal response equilibrium, subgame perfect minimax regret equilibrium, level-k thinking, and diagonalization heuristics. Moreover, the MAM is unique under plausible conditions. Overall, contributions in the MAM experiment averaged 94.9%.

Self-serving biases are often identified by asking people what fairness standards apply in situations with alternative income distributions. Nevertheless, when the response to a question is connected with a distributional decision, only the reply, but not necessarily the fairness standard, is biased. Social preference models envisage decisions as a compromise between self-interest and social concerns (norms). A model-based estimation of social concerns, as provided by this paper, is capable of identifying different sorts of self-serving biases. Higher income triggers higher fairness scores, but there are no indications that a relatively higher income compared to the peers is generally perceived as fairer than a relatively lower income.

"Humans prefer relatively equal distributions of resources, yet societies have varying degrees of economic inequality. To investigate some of the possible determinants and consequences of inequality, here we perform experiments involving a networked public goods game in which subjects interact and gain or losewealth. Subjects (n = 1,462) were randomly assigned to have higher or lower initial endowments, and were embedded within social networks with three levels of economic inequality (Gini coefficient50.0, 0.2, and 0.4). In addition, we manipulated the visibility of the wealth of network neighbours. We show that wealth visibility facilitates the downstream consequences of initial inequality—in initially more unequal situations, wealth visibility leads to greater inequality than when wealth is invisible. This result reflects a heterogeneous response to visibility in richer versus poorer subjects. We also find that making wealth visible has adverse welfare consequences, yielding lower levels of overall cooperation, inter-connectedness, and wealth. High initial levels of economic inequality alone, however, have relatively few deleterious welfare effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We report the results of a new public goods experiment with an intra-group cooperation dilemma and inter-group competition. In our design subjects receive information about their relative individual and group performance after each round with non-incentivized and then incentivized group competition. We found that, on average, individuals with low relative performance reduce their contributions to the public good, but groups with low performance increase theirs. With incentivized competition, where the relative ranking of the group increases individual payoffs, the reaction to relative performance is larger with individuals contributing more to the group; further, we observe that the variance of strategies decreases as individual and group rankings increase. These results offer new insights on how social comparison shapes similar reactions in games with different incentives for group performance and how competition and cooperation can influence each other.

"Does transparent leadership promote cooperative groups? We address this issue using a public goods experiment with exogenously selected leaders who are able to send non-binding contribution suggestions to the group. To investigate the effect of transparency in this setting we vary the ease with which a leader's actions are known by the group. We find leaders’ suggestions encourage cooperation in all treatments, but that both leaders and their group members are more likely to follow leaders’ recommendations when institutions are transparent so that non-leaders can easily see what the leader does. Consequently, transparency leads to significantly more cooperation, higher group earnings and reduced variation in contributions among group members.

"A naturalistic public good experiment is used to examine whether better players cooperate more or less than others. 'Better' is measured by subjects' accuracy in a team-based shooting game, and cooperation is measured by introducing a public good decision into the game. A data set of 92 subjects was created and results show that better players cooperate significantly less than others. Economic theory is used to explain the result.

"A defining aspect of human cooperation is the use of sophisticated indirect reciprocity. We observe others, talk about others, and act accordingly. We help those who help others, and we cooperate expecting that others will cooperate in return. Indirect reciprocity is based on reputation, which spreads by communication. A crucial aspect of indirect reciprocity is observability: reputation effects can support cooperation as long as peoples' actions can be observed by others. In evolutionary models of indirect reciprocity, natural selection favors cooperation when observability is sufficiently high. Complementing this theoretical work are experiments where observability promotes cooperation among small groups playing games in the laboratory. Until now, however, there has been little evidence of observability's power to promote large-scale cooperation in real-world settings. Here we provide such evidence using a field study involving 2,413 subjects. We collaborated with a utility company to study participation in a program designed to prevent blackouts. We show that observability triples participation in this public goods game. The effect is nearly seven times larger than offering a $25 monetary incentive, the company's previous policy. Furthermore, as predicted by indirect reciprocity, we provide evidence that reputational concerns are driving our observability effect. In sum, we show how indirect reciprocity can be harnessed to increase cooperation in a relevant, real-world public goods game. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Compared the cooperative behavior between Taiwan and American students in a social dilemma situation and studied the effect of inspection/punishment on their cooperative behavior and the behavior between individualism and collectivism. Human Ss: 56 normal Chinese male and 152 normal Chinese female adults (university students). 67 normal American male and 101 normal American female adults (university students). The study adopted a replenishable resource paradigm (J. Chan, 1988) referring to fish and fishing, and 3 influential factors—known vs unknown inspection probability, high vs low probability of inspection, and degree of punishment—were used in the 2 by 2 by 2 design. Ss' individual social motivation, individualism, or collectivism were assessed, and their relations with the cooperative behavior and culture were studied by using factorial ANOVA.

"Prior theory on prosocial behavior has suggested that, when we act uncooperatively for other reasons, we may justify that uncooperativeness by telling ourselves that '... I probably couldn't have made a difference anyway,' that is, by minimizing the efficacy of our cooperative actions. A pair of experiments examined this question in the context of social dilemmas, where there are always clear disincentives to cooperate. In Exp 1, using 106 undergraduate students, it was found that making these disincentives stronger not only decreased cooperation, but also decreased group members' sense that acting cooperatively was efficacious for enhancing the group's welfare. An alternative explanation to a defensive, self-justification explanation for the latter finding was then identified. The results of Exp 2, using 97 undergraduate students, ruled out this alternative explanation as well as providing additional evidence for a justification-via-inefficacy effect. The implications of such defensive processes for cooperation in social dilemmas are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Examined the role of self-interested and prosocial concerns in the approval of a real-life structural solution: the privatization of the British national railway system in 1996. 137 adults completed a questionnaire examining social value orientation and privatization. As predicted, disapproval of privatizing this public good increased when people were more concerned about the transition costs of privatization, and about how privatization would affect their personal outcomes (e.g., travel convenience) and the outcomes for the collective (e.g., railway accessibility). Moreover, the approval of privatization among people guided primarily by their self-interest (i.e., pro-self individuals) was influenced more strongly by personal outcome concerns. Contrary to hypothesis, however, prosocial individuals' approval of privatization was not influenced more strongly by collective outcome concerns. Finally, people who disapproved of privatization also exhibited a weaker intention to travel by train in the future, an indication that the willingness to engage in collectively desirable behavior may decrease when people fail to endorse a structural solution.

"The term procedural frames is introduced and defined as different representations of structurally equivalent allocation processes. Study 1 compared 2 well-known games, sequential social dilemmas and ultimatum bargaining, that share the same structure: Player 1 creates an allocation of a resource and Player 2 decides whether to allow it or deny it. Study 1 found that Player 1 made more favorable allocations and Player 2 accepted more unfavorable allocations in a social dilemma frame than in an equivalent ultimatum bargaining frame. Study 2 revealed the critical determinant was whether Player 2 had to respond to an allocation by accepting or rejecting it (as in the ultimatum game) or by making a claim (as in the social dilemma). Two additional studies explored how these actions are perceived. The inconsistency of behavior across procedural frames raises methodological concerns but illuminates construal processes that guide allocation.

"Face-to-face discussion has been shown to increase cooperative behavior in social dilemmas. Two general explanations of this effect were tested: group identity (concern for fellow group members' outcomes) and perception of consensus (degree of agreement perceived among group members on how to respond to the dilemma). 160 female undergraduates participated in 4-person groups in 1 of 4 experimental conditions. The 4 conditions differed in common fate (interdependent outcome in a lottery), face-to-face discussion of the dilemma, discussion of an important (irrelevant) issue, and no discussion (control). Results indicate that (1) the common fate manipulation neither aroused group identity nor enhanced cooperation; (2) group identity may not be sufficient to elicit cooperation in a social dilemma; and (3) the most plausible explanation of group discussion effects is members' perceived consensus to cooperate.

"A social dilemma is a situation in which members of a group are faced with a conflict between two choices: maximizing personal interests (defection) or maximizing collective interests (cooperation). It is generally more profitable to defect, but if all do so, all are worse off than if all choose to cooperate. A public goods dilemma is a special case of a social dilemma in which people must contribute resources to provide a public good. Communication, especially face-to-face discussion, has been shown to be effective in facilitating cooperation in such situations, including asking members to make a pledge to contribute (cooperate). The purpose of this study was to evaluate some explanations for the effectiveness of a pledge in enhancing cooperation. 256 undergraduate students (in groups of four subjects) were asked to make choices in a public goods dilemma. The results suggest that a pledge is effective in enhancing cooperation because it induces group identity and the perception of criticality. It is suggested that when face-to-face discussion is not feasible, a pledge system may be effective in solving real life social dilemmas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Traditional explanations for the survival of cooperation in social dilemmas rely on a variety of mechanisms to make cooperative acts in one's narrow self-interest. If cooperation can only be explained when it is self-interested then, absent mechanisms to make it so, people 'should' always defect. This prediction conflicts with one of the most robust findings in experimental social dilemma research: People often do cooperate absent incentive compatibility. This is frequently explained by claiming that the subjective ranking of dilemma outcomes can differ from the objective ranking of individual payoffs. According to a procedural conception of rationality, one's subjectively defined preferences, joined in a expected utility calculation with one's expectations of others' behavior, could yield rational cooperative choices absent incentive compatibility. I test this 'procedural rationality' model in two experimental studies of anonymous, one-shot prisoners' dilemma decision making. The procedural model is more accurate at predicting choices than more traditional rational choice approaches, but fails to account for a significant proportion of observed cooperation. The data show that this failure is the result of the model's mis-specification of the relationship between expectations of others' behavior and outcome evaluations. Specifically: (1) expectations of others' behavior affect cooperate vs. defect choices regardless of one's outcome aspirations, and (2) expectations and aspirations are interdependent decision factors--shifts in one lead to shifts in the other. Taken together, these two findings draw a picture of values in interdependent interaction, not as exogenous and stable, but as constructed by, and adaptive to perception of the social environment.

"Examined in a sample of 64 university students the effects of emotional mood and evaluative priming on cooperation in a social dilemma game. The empirical findings are consistent with such an interpretation. Cooperation in a 4-person dilemma game was found to increase when positive connotations of cooperation and negative connotations of competition are primed in a preceding verbal learning task. However, the mood manipulation did not directly affect the decision to cooperate but only indirectly via increased variability. In fact, Ss in good mood made more cooperative as well as more competitive choices than Ss in bad mood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We predicted that feeling empathy for another member of the collective in a social dilemma would create an altruistic desire to allocate resources to that person as an individual, reducing collective good. To test this prediction, 2 studies were run. In each, participants faced a dilemma in which they could choose to benefit themselves, the group, or other group members as individuals. In Study 1, empathy for another group member was manipulated; in Study 2, naturally occurring empathic response was determined by self-report. In both studies, participants who experienced high empathy allocated more resources to the target of empathy, reducing the overall collective good. These results suggest the importance of considering self-interest, collective interest, and other-interest (altruism) as three distinct motives, each of which may operate in social dilemmas.

"Focused on the role of information provided by pledges made by group members before each trial of an iterated public goods dilemma (specifically, the effect of pledge-making on people's contributions to the joint account in a public goods paradigm). Two experiments contrasted several types of pledge conditions (nonbinding and minimum-binding conditions) with a 'no-pledge' (control) condition. 120 undergraduates participated in Exp 1, which (1) explored the assumption that making a pledge before making a contribution decision would result in greater contributions than when no pledge is made and (2) assessed the effects of the bindingness of the pledge. Exp 2 consisted of 135 undergraduates and replicated some of the results of Exp 1. Results show that in a public goods dilemma a pledge with a certain degree of commitment may facilitate cooperative behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Applies a market mechanism derived from principles of welfare economics to a social dilemma simulation. In Study 1, 12 of 24 5-person groups of undergraduates were offered the opportunity to voluntarily 'buy-out' one or more group members in an effort to conserve a shared, scarce resource. 10 of these groups achieved at least 1 member buy-out per game. Despite their size these groups did not sustain the resource pool any longer than intact control groups. Rather, Ss behaved in a more self-interested manner. Study 2 (45 5-person groups) varied the 'buy-out' intervention to promote collective concerns. Intervention was not sensitive to changes in the specifics of operationalization.

"Two experiments examined whether trait inferences and cooperative decisions in a social dilemma are influenced by biased perceptions of the group's past success or failure in resolving the dilemma. In each experiment, Ss joined a group that had previously either succeeded or failed to provide a step-level public good. Ss were informed of (1) the number of members who had contributed to the good, and (2) the investment quota, defined as the number of contributors needed for the good to be provided. The number of group members who had contributed was held constant, and the past success or failure of the group was determined by varying the severity of the quota. Ss in both experiments displayed the correspondence bias, judging successful groups as more cooperative and competent than unsuccessful ones. Moreover, past group success tended to engender cooperation in subsequent public goods problems, particularly those featuring severe or unknown quotas.

"Investigated whether presenting a social dilemma as a Public Good Dilemma (PGD) or a Resource Dilemma (RD) affects the employment of coordination rules. In the PGD, Ss were endowed with a certain number of points and could obtain a bonus if, as a group, they would give more than 120 points. In the RD, Ss could take points from a certain source and could obtain a bonus if they would leave more than 120 points in this source. In Exps 1 and 2, with 158 undergraduates, asymmetry of endowments was induced: In the PGD, 2 Ss could give twice as many points as the other 2, whereas in the RD, 2 Ss could take twice as many points as the other 2. In Exp 3, with 78 undergraduates asymmetry of interests was induced. Ss coordinated their choice behavior differently in these 2 dilemma situations. Ss playing a PGD tend to give in proportion to their endowments or interest position. Ss playing a RD coordinate choice behavior in a way that minimizes differences in final outcomes.

"Examines the effect of intergroup competition on intragroup cooperation, and reviews 3 experiments. The 1st experiment (G.

The 2nd experiment (G.

The 3rd experiment (I. Erev et al, 1993) demonstrated, in a realistic work environment (orange-picking task), that the increase in intragroup cooperation can be accounted for at least in part by motivational, rather than structural, effects of the intergroup competition.

Existing literature fails to examine the problems posed by lack of information about others' preferences.

The most efficient information-gathering strategy for such a player is cooperation. The model helps to explain why players of assurance take the risk of initial cooperation to gain reassurance.

"Discusses the limitations of the rational-structural and goal/expectation approaches to the problem of public goods (PGs), presents a new approach—the structural goal/expectation approach—intended to overcome these limitations, and tested 4 predictions derived from the new approach in a study of 48 4-person groups of undergraduates. According to this new approach, members who have realized the undesirable consequence of free riding and the importance of mutual cooperation will cooperate to establish a sanctioning system that assures other members' cooperation instead of trying to induce other members into mutual cooperation directly through cooperative actions. One important condition for their voluntary cooperation in the establishment of a sanctioning system is their realization that voluntarily based cooperation is impossible. In the study, each member of the group was given resource money that they could keep for themselves or contribute to the provision of a PG. The increase in the personal benefit due to one's contribution was reduced to zero, and Ss were not allowed to see each other in person. Some groups were given opportunities to develop a negative sanctioning system that punished the least cooperative group member. The level of punishment depended on the total amount of contribution made by the group members to the sanctioning system, which was separate from the contribution to the original PG.

"Compared 2 motivational bases for not contributing to a public good, desire to 'free ride' (or greed) and fear of being a 'sucker,' among 110 Japanese undergraduates. It was hypothesized that these 2 types of motivation would be activated under different situations. When a public good was provided conjunctively, fear would have a strong effect but greed would not; when a public good was disjunctively provided, greed would have a strong effect but fear would not. In addition, it was predicted that the greater mutual trust existing among friends would make them contribute more than strangers would in the conjunctive condition but would make no difference in the disjunctive condition. Three types of production rules, in which a public good was conjunctively, disjunctively, or additively produced on the basis of members' contributions, were experimentally created. Half of the groups in each condition consisted of total strangers, and the other half consisted of friends.

"Investigated whether, and to what extent, individuals will voluntarily contribute their resources toward the achievement of a public good (i.e., one which, when provided for any member of a group, cannot be denied to any other members). Based on M. Olson's 1968 theory of rational decision-making, it was hypothesized that (a) given only a public good to be achieved, contributions from individuals in a large group will be smaller than those in a small group; (b) in a large group when individual actions are not effective in achieving a public good, contributions from individuals will be larger in a situation where a private good is contingent on contributions to the public good than in a situation where no private good is provided; (c) contributions toward a group goal will be less when individual actions are anonymous; and (d) an individual's contribution will be of similar size to those of other group members. Ss were 93 female undergraduates whose performance on an exercise bicycle was the measure of contribution. Results support hypotheses (a) and (b), partially support (c), and do not support (d).

In each study, Ss assigned to 4-person groups chose how many resources to contribute to a generic advertising campaign, the effectiveness of which depended on total funding levels. Each group member represented a different 'store' in the same mall. The instructions framed the problem by presenting varying sales trends for the stores--Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Ss confronting the declining trend contributed significantly more than those in either of the other 2 conditions. A declining sales trend also positively influenced their expectations that others would contribute as well. The third experiment demonstrated that a decline-induced equilibrium persisted over trials of a finitely repeated game with a known stopping point. Surprisingly, the specific identification of a competitor mall as the cause of the decline in sales actually resulted in lower levels of contribution.

"Whereas most experimental studies of public goods provisioning require that all players make their decisions simultaneously, in most organizational settings contribution decisions are made in real time. To account for this aspect of the decision process, we introduce a real-time protocol of play in which, at any point in time, players can either withhold or contribute their entire endowment to a step-level public good. Once contributed, the individual endowments--that in the present experiment differ from one group member to another--cannot be withdrawn. Our results show that contribution levels under the real-time protocol with irrevocable commitments significantly exceed those observed in previous studies under the more common simultaneous protocol of play, thereby considerably reducing social loafing. Consistent with our equilibrium analysis, over multiple iterations of the game play converges to an equilibrium set of players who maximize the sum of their individual benefit-to-contribution ratios.

"It has been argued that a structural solution to social dilemmas is to install a leader, but here we consider the possibility the group members will oppose giving up their decisional freedom. Previous studies have shown that feedback indicating collective failure results in a stronger preference for the leadership option. We argue that preferences for the leadership option depend not on on the feedback group members receive, but also on the type of dilemma they are facing. The results of our experiment, in which manipulated dilemma type as well as feedback, corroborate our reasoning. The distribution of initial property in public good at common resource dilemmas helps to explain these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The present research examined the assumption that the higher the probability that decision-makers perceive their contribution to be critical to the group outcome the higher the chance that they will contribute. Contrary to the widely accepted view that highly critical people contribute more because it is in their self-interest to do so, the authors argue that this criticality effect may also be explained, at least partly, in terms of decision-makers focus on the consequences of own behavior on other's outcomes. In line with this, it was hypothesized that high perceived criticality activates feelings of social responsibility (which includes an other-oriented approach) and in turn influences contributions. Across 3 studies, in a sample of male and female college students, using a linear public good dilemma, a step-level dilemma with different monetary endowments, and a sequential step-level dilemma, supportive evidence for this hypothesis was found. These results suggest that the self-interest explanation is too limited to fully account for the criticality effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Social dilemmas are situations in which individual incentives and group incentives conflict. Public goods sustained by contributions of time and money, such as public television, and resource goods sustained by restraint from taking, such as rainforests, represent two types of social dilemmas. In this study, we examine whether the two types of social dilemmas generate the same amount of cooperation when the costs and benefits are exactly the same. Rational choice perspectives suggest equivalent levels of cooperation, whereas alternative perspectives such as prospect theory suggest that resource goods might generate greater cooperation. Combining prospect theory and strategic game theory, we predict that resource good settings will have higher levels of cooperation. We test the predictions in two different cultures: the US and the People's Republic of China. We find consistent patterns: in both countries, group members were more cooperative when faced with resource goods dilemmas than when faced with public goods dilemmas.

"This paper explores the effects of group identity and gender in a public goods experiment. We compare the behavior of participants who can be expected to have a pre-existing sense of group identity to that of randomly selected participants, and to that of participants who have undertaken community-building pre-experiment activities. While statistically significant differences were observed, our results suggest that the effects of group identity and gender on behavior are complicated, involving the nature of the groups involved. In particular, the claim that women are less likely to free-ride on others with whom they have a relationship is not supported. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This study examined the combined effects of identification level, social value orientation, and feedback on contributions in a public goods dilemma. Previous research has shown that strengthening group identity promotes cooperation. One explanation for this finding is that a strong group identity transforms people's motives from the personal to the collective level (the goal transformation hypothesis). Evidence for this hypothesis can be found in studies showing that a strong sense of group identity influences proselfs, relative to prosocials, to make larger contributions. In this experiment, the authors, with 142 subjects (Ss; mean age 19.07 yrs), demonstrated that these findings are restricted to situations in which no feedback about a group's performance is provided. When performance feedback is provided, a strong group identity cancels the effects of individual differences in social value orientations. In particular, when a group fails, contributions increase if group identity is salient, but decrease if personal identity is salient, regardless of a person's social value orientation. But when a group succeeds, no differences between group and personal identity are found. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Examined whether leaders high in charisma are able to motivate decision-makers to cooperate more in a public goods dilemma. It was expected that a charismatic leader would be able to transform people's motives beyond self-interest, consequently increasing cooperation. This transformation effect was expected to occur among individuals aimed at maximizing their own self-interest (i.e., pro-selfs), but not among those aimed at maximizing joint or collective outcomes (i.e., pro-socials). Leader's charisma was experimentally manipulated by means of describing the leader as either self-sacrificing or benefiting. 104 male and 79 female students (mean age 19.11 yrs) participated. The results revealed that self-sacrificing leaders, contrary to benefiting leaders, were perceived as more charismatic and were able to motivate decision-makers to cooperate more. The latter effect appeared to be more pronounced among pro-selfs rather than pro-socials, as such supporting the transformational idea of charismatic leaders. Further results showed that this behavioral effect was mediated by perceptions of legitimacy. The meaning and conception of charismatic leadership in decision-making situations are discussed by using insights from the social dilemma and charismatic leadership literature.

"Hypothesized that since the manipulation of situational variables in effect alters the information each S has about the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the other player, or both, then a relevant organismic variable might well be the information processing characteristics of the players. 36 pairs of male undergraduates played a 60-trial iterative Prisoner's Dilemma game in 1 of 2 conditions: face-to-face or in separate rooms. One-half of the Ss were abstract information processors (AIP), and one-half were concrete information processors (CIP). S pairs were formed on the basis of the level of information processing complexity (LIP) of the members. These pairs were then assigned to 1 of 3 conditions which were based upon the LIP of the Ss. The resultant groups were: AIP-AIP, AIP-CIP, and CIP-CIP. It was predicted that LIP and information available about the other S would be nonindependent with respect to cooperation, defections, and money won. Results support the hypothesis for cooperation and defection, but not for the money won. An examination of the interaction of the independent variables suggests that AIPs and CIPs approached this task differently, and developed their strategies from different types of information.

"Notes that multiperson versions of Prisoner's Dilemma are widely applicable in the social sciences. Examination of 2 important classes of real-world situations reveals that although both can appropriately be called Prisoner's Dilemma, they have incompatible payoff structures. Prisoner's Dilemma games constitute an important but apparently ambiguous set of models. A taxonomy of multiperson Prisoner's Dilemma was attempted. Some aspects of the well-studied 2-person case provided a useful beginning. In the general multiperson form, however, some properties of the 2-person game were incompatible with others and were dropped. Additional properties were suggested by strategic considerations and the associated social phenomena. Interdependencies among the various properties are demonstrated and related to a simple graphical representation. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Notes that studies investigating the effects of reward level on behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma have yielded mixed results, but most have found either that no systematic relationship existed between choices and reward level or that as reward level increased cooperative behavior decreased. It was hypothesized that these results were due to Ss in the high-reward conditions reacting negatively to their perception that they were being inequitably overpaid. Results with 80 male undergraduates support this hypothesis: Ss who worked on a pretask for 11/2 hr. were more cooperative when they played 10 trials of a high-reward matrix Prisoner's Dilemma game than when they played a low-reward matrix game; the opposite was found for Ss who did not work before playing the game.

"General psychology students played 1 of 2 versions of the Prisoner's Dilemma game for 50 trials; 1 version was presented in matrix form and the other in nonmatrix form. Ss under the nonmatrix format condition cooperated more frequently than Ss under the matrix format condition. This finding supported the contention that the high frequency of uncooperative behavior typically exhibited by college students playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game is due, at least in part, to nonstrategic elements of matrix presentation of the game.

"Compared the effects of 2 dosages (25 and 10 mg) on the strategic choice behavior of 108 male graduate students in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Ss were assigned to either a drug, placebo, or no-capsule control group. Ss given chlordiazepoxide showed more mutual cooperation and less mutual uncooperation than the placebo or no-capsule groups. Although all chlordiazepoxide Ss won more than the other Ss, there was a nonsignificant inverse relationship between the drug dose and the amount won.

"Conducted 2 experiments to investigate the effect of communication on cooperative choice during game playing. In Exp I, 6 mixed-sex pairs of undergraduates played a form of the Prisoner's Dilemma game under conditions of real reward. Ss were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: immediate communication (IC), delayed communication (DC), or no communicaton (NC). Results indicate no major sex differences in the number of cooperative choices either across or within communication conditions. Significant differences were found between conditions-the IC condition averaged 84% cooperative responses compared with 55% for the DC condition and 32% for the NC group. Exp II examined the effect of communication on a situation which simulated the type of environment which may result in collusive crime. A creative alternative game was designed to examine the effect of a personality variable on performance. Ss were paired by dogmatism scores. The 3 communication conditions from Exp I were also repeated creating a 4(dogmatism)  3(communication) design. Results indicate that communication is apparently a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reaching a creative solution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Investigated 3 presentation formats of the Prisoner's Dilemma game, assigning 15 pairs of male Ss to each of 3 experimental conditions. One group played a conventional matrix representation of the game, one played an expected value representation, and one played a simplified probabilistic version called 'Take-Some.' Each pair of Ss played their game for 50 trials. 11 dependent variables were factor analyzed, yielding 3 meaningful factors. A multivariate analysis of variance of variables representing these factors, together with percentage of cooperation, showed that the 'Take-Some' version of the game produced higher levels of cooperative interaction than the other 2 formats. Marginal analyses of variance also indicated that 'Take-Some' was significantly different from the other 2 formats on 3 of the 4 dependent variables. The differences between the 3 game formats are discussed in terms of the motives affecting the competitive strategy choice in each of the game formats.

Furthermore, the findings indicate that in a range of medium risk, cooperation grows with increasing risk.

"Used the choices of 126 female undergraduates in 2 types of mixed-motive game situations to select Ss who had predominantly own-gain and Ss who had predominantly relative-gain goals. On the basis of simple reward notions, it was predicted that the former but not the latter would change from competitive to cooperative responding in decomposed Prisoner's Dilemma game situations when interacting with a conditionally cooperative other. Corresponding yoked controls were not expected to become cooperative. The availability of social comparison with an outcome, which was smaller than the mutually cooperative outcome but larger than the mutually competitive outcome, was expected to lead own-gain Ss to more rapid learning of cooperation but not to affect the responses of corresponding yoked controls or of relative gain Ss. A 2  2  2  5 factorial design was used in which the factors were goal orientation (own gain vs relative gain), strategy of the other (conditionally cooperative vs yoked control), the availability vs unavailability of the social comparison, and trials. Results strongly support each of the expectations.

The 2 types of games were crossed with 2 sets of payoff matrices producing 4 experimental conditions. It was predicted that Ss in the asymmetric condition would exhibit less cooperative behavior than Ss in the symmetric condition and that this effect would be due to the significantly lower amount of cooperation for Ss in the low potential reward condition. Predicted outcomes were supported. It is concluded that concern with relative outcomes and being surpassed by another, rather than maximization of one's own outcomes, was the primary motivating factor.

"Attempts to relate the player's behavior in a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game to a loosely defined psychological attitude of altruism. The game matrix is transformed into a zero-sum game matrix that for each player reflects the strategic elements of the original game as modified by the degree of altruism he may feel toward his opponent. The transformation consists of adding to a player's payoffs those of his opponent multiplied by a factor designated as the player's 'altruism parameter.' 3 sets of assumptions are considered in order to make predictions about the play of the game to differing degrees of detail. Results of the analysis include qualitative and quantitative measures of conflict inherent in a PD game, estimates of the distribution of the altruism parameter among players, and qualitative predictions concerning the dynamics of play when interactive changes of altruism occur.

"Selected 72 undergraduates with high or low dominance scores on the A-S Reaction Study: A Scale for Measuring Ascendance-Submission in Personality. Ss were then divided into high-, low-, or mixed-dominance pairs of the same sex, and played 300 trials of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. It was found that high-dominance pairs, but not low-dominance pairs, locked-in sooner than mixed pairs. In addition, high-dominance pairs had a larger proportion of D responses, D,D joint responses, and locks-in on D,D. Intercorrelations between the 'state-conditioned propensities' were higher than those reported by A. Rapoport and A. Chammah. It is suggested that these propensities may provide a means of detecting sex differences in behavior in the game. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Investigated the effects of 2 proxemic factors (seating arrangement and availability of eye contact) on the cooperation, interpersonal attitude, and approach-avoidance tendencies shown by 80 male undergraduates engaged in a 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma game. As expected, significant interactions emerged between these 2 proxemic factors on all 3 of the above outcomes. Consistent with role-play findings, more positive cooperation and attitudinal outcomes tended to be associated with the more proximal side-by-side seating arrangement when interplayer eye contact was blocked. No trend emerged for the approach-avoidance data in this condition. When eye contact was available, however, the opposite pattern emerged; the more positive outcomes for all 3 dependent measures were associated with the less proximal across-table seating arrangement. The greater eye contact inherent in the across-table arrangement is discussed, along with the limitations of role-play data in the area of nonverbal communication. (18 ref.)

Results indicate that both high-understanding instructions and recruiting Ss to participate for money (rather than credit) promoted cooperation, while reward level had no significant effect.

"Reports results of a study in which 520 male undergraduates in 260 teams played a Prisoner's Dilemma game for 300 or more trials. Teams made more cooperative choices in response to a tit-for-tat strategy, played by a simulated opposing team, than they did in response to any of 3 variations on a tit-for-tat theme. A preliminary period of 30 competitive choices resulted in more cooperation during the 300 main trials. In all conditions, partners received better ratings than opponents. When the Ss played confederates, they favored the ingroup most on sociometric traits. When they played other naive Ss, they favored the ingroup most on motive traits (borderline significance). This last result agrees with previous studies using only naive Ss and supports a hypothesis of selective bias in intergroup perceptions. A striking contrast occurred between the high level of cooperation (68%) elicited by the predictable, reciprocal programmed strategies and the much lower level (43%) in the natural play condition. Results suggest the general applicability of a predictably contingent strategy. (91 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Examined the conclusion of several prisoner's dilemma (pd) studies that, since incentive magnitude has little effect upon average cooperation levels, the typical use of trivial payoffs does not jeopardize the meaning of pd findings. 80 male undergraduates served as ss in a 10-trial pd game. 2 levels of incentive, pennies and dollars, were crossed with 2 levels of instruction, traditional and comprehensive. Average cooperation levels did not differ across the 4 experimental conditions. High incentives, however, produced significantly greater interdyad variance than low incentives. The difference in variance between instruction conditions was not significant. Reliability coefficients for the task and measures of response latency suggest that the increase in variance for high incentives was true variance, rather than error variance. Results suggest that generalization from pd studies using trivial incentives should be limited to behavior in parlor games. (24 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"After learning the Prisoner's Dilemma game 98 undergraduates who had indicated that their own goal would be cooperative vs. competitive (N = 49 in each case) were presented with short sequences of interaction between Players A and B. For each 1, they judged its information value as to A's intention for the relationship, what intention it indicated, etc. These judgments provided the evidence for testing a series of hypotheses suggested by attribution theory. Support was obtained for the hypothesis that consistent behavior by A yields more information and consensus than does inconsistent behavior. Partial support was found for the hypotheses that (a) consistent disagreement with B yields greater information than consistent agreement, and (b) inconsistency that constitutes an 'initiative' or shift away from B yields greater information than inconsistency that constitutes an 'imitative' shift toward B. Both were found to be true when A's final action in the sequence was competitive but not when it was cooperative. The hypothesis that competitive behavior, being regarded as less socially desirable and more uncommon, will yield more information than cooperative behavior was not supported. Results are reported on judgments of 'acting on principle' and inferences as to A's expectations about B's later moves. Evidence on individual differences in attribution is consistent with the proposition that attributions are made according to the S's experience with internal and external causes of his own behavior.

Moratorium (in crisis) Ss cooperated less with high than low authority opponents interpreted as rebellion and also matched their responses to their opponents' more often than the other statuses (interpreted as need for guidance in decision-making). Moratoriums' high anxiety manifested itself in longer response latencies under increasing competiton. Partner perception as high as opposed to low authority yielded significantly longer response latencies.

Large monetary rewards were used in the experiment with each S having the opportunity to win $10. The results were in the direction predicted by the index of 'average payoff per trial' and were in the opposite direction from the predictions made by the 'index of competitive advantage' and the 'average advantage of competition.' It is concluded that the latter indices are successful in predicting behavior only when small or imaginary rewards are at stake. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Investigated the psychological dimensions and processes associated with 3 decomposed Prisoner's Dilemma games that produced radically different patterns of action in a previous study by D. G. Pruitt (see 41:11). 120 male undergraduates were assigned to the cells of a 3  2 design, involving the 3 games and cooperative vs. noncooperative input from the 'other player.' 30 more Ss were run as controls, which demonstrated that the use of questionnaires on every trial had no effect on behavior. Behavioral and questionnaire data converged on a motivational explanation of the differences among the games. The 2 games that produced cooperative behavior in the earlier study apparently elicit a relatively durable desire for cooperation from the other player. The game that previously produced noncooperation apparently elicits a desire for the payoff associated with mutual noncooperation and a fragile interest in fair division. These motives can be traced to features of the reward structure of the games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Each of 72 male undergraduates participated in a Prisoner's Dilemma game involving 9 levels of cooperation by a simulated other. It was found that Ss were quite accurate in detecting the other's overall level of cooperation, as well as the other's reciprocation of S's noncooperative choices. However, detection of the other's reciprocation of cooperative choices was frequently inaccurate. With regard to the latter, S's own reciprocation of the other's cooperative choices was significantly related to S's perception of the other's strategy.

"Utilized identical false feedback to 50 male and 50 female undergraduates in 5 conditions. In 2 conditions Ss played a standard 2-choice Prisoner's Dilemma game (200 trials); in 2 conditions Ss played the standard game modified to include a prediction of other's behavior on each trial. In each of these above situations, Ss in 1 condition were told that they were faced with a preset sequence while Ss in the other condition thought they were playing with 1 of the other Ss present in the experiment. In a 5th condition feedback was not given any meaning as part of the game task; Ss merely had to predict the appearance of 1 of 2 lights on each of 200 trials. Analysis of the frequency of cooperative choice in the game indicates that the addition of prediction had no significant main effect on choice behavior. There was a 3-factor interaction effect with the description of the feedback and the trial block of the game. Ss tended to decrease cooperation over trial blocks. The act of prediction reduced this effect for Ss who thought they faced a preset computer sequence but not for those attempting to predict the moves of a human adversary. The use of prediction data in combination with choice data produced 4 indices of 'behavior contingent upon expectation of opponent's behavior' which were useful in interpreting the higher cooperation of the females as an inability to find or maintain optimal strategies for maximizing their own rewards. Examination of the prediction data alone revealed that a probability matching hypothesis by itself will be inadequate to explain Ss' trial by trial expectations of other's behavior. (16 ref.)

"Determined how behavior is affected when a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is embedded in a larger decision framework. 12 pairs of undergraduates were confronted with a 30-price choice matrix. Monetary rewards were used and the situation was couched in terms of 2 firms in a market. As a control group, 11 pairs of Ss were confronted with a 2-choice PD. A large difference in payoff was observed between 2 sessions where the large matrix was run. Further investigation indicated that major field provided a better explanation than sex mix of Ss. Perhaps this result carries over to other attempts to relate PD behavior to sex. It was predicted that: (a) there would be more cooperation in the 2  2 matrix, (b) that cooperators in the large matrix would be spread throughout the PD range, (c) that the larger number of strategies would lead to a more unequal split of payoffs and less stable cooperation, and (d) that Ss would be spread across the entire PD range in the large matrix. All these hypotheses were corroborated by the data, although results were not always significant. (17 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Although the focus was on the applicability of the research tool to the population studied, 3 hypotheses guided the specific design: (1) cooperative behavior would be a linear function of a ratio of differences between payoff values; (2) a cooperative response that involved turning toward the other player would not differ from a cooperative response that involved turning away from the other player; and (3) males would cooperate more often than females. Although Hypothesis 1 was disconfirmed, it was found that it was easier to 'forgive' someone for an injury incurred or to 'repent' for an insult rendered if the person is nearby but is not faced and not seen. Females were generally more cooperative than males. It is concluded that the modified version of the PDG is applicable to a preadolescent population and could become an important tool for the study of the developmental aspects of social conflict.

"To study the effects of a payoff-adjusting option on game behavior, 30 S pairs played a 63-trial Prisoner's Dilemma game under either individualistic, competitive, or competitive plus simulated-war instructions. All Ss had the opportunity to escalate or deescalate the payoffs to themselves and the other players by factors from 10-1/10. In the competitive groups, an escalation or deescalation tended to be countered by a response of the opposite kind. All group mean scale value choices were positive, but Ss in the individualistic condition chose higher scale values and made fewer scale value changes. No group showed a trend in scale value level across trials. The 2 competitive groups showed no behavioral differences. Game performance for Ss in all groups was unrelated to F scale score.

"A symbolic interactionist view of experimental situations suggests that Ss behave to create favorable situated identities in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). The goal-structure of the PDG, being ambiguous, can lead Ss to play for diverse purposes: to select different strategies to become 'good players,' or to define moves as expressive of their dispositional qualities as 'good persons.' An experiment was designed to manipulate goal-ambiguity and the dispositional inferences implied by different choices. Players saw a hypothetical game between Al and Bob, whom they characterized on 2 adjective check-lists, 1 of which favored competitive 'player' qualities, while the other valued cooperative 'person' qualities. Ss then played the game, as had their Al and Bob examples, for either points or pennies. Both incentive and list conditions affected cooperative rates as anticipated, but unexpected interactions appeared. Apparently, the meaning of play-moves changed substantially by condition and also varied differentially within conditions. These variations in the situational meaning of behaviors are thought to occur routinely in the PDG and other laboratory studies. They imply a need to revise traditional design and measurement procedures in social psychological experimentation. (3 p. ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"24 teams composed of undergraduates played a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game with other teams composed of confederates. Ss rated competitive confederates higher on ability and lower on game-related motives. Japanese Ss showed more cooperation than did Caucasians. Results suggest that bias in intergroup perceptions can favor and belittle the outgroup, and that the nature of the distortion depends on the outgroup's behavior as well as on dynamic factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"56 male and 56 female undergraduates played a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game, 2 teams playing on each occasion. Ss chose a competitive or cooperative strategy toward both their opponents and partners on 20 trials. Partners received more cooperative choices (p < .01). Ratings on ability, sociometric, and motive traits improved for both ingroup and outgroup, but more for the ingroup. The ingroup-outgroup differential was significantly stronger for game-relevant motive traits than for any other type of trait. Results support a selective bias hypothesis, which implies that bias in intergroup perceptions is especially great in the case of motives aroused by intergroup contact. A projective mechanism which defends against the perception of reprehensible motives in the ingroup might account for this selective bias.

"Recent criticism of research using the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game suggests that previously obtained results may be seen as an artifact of the typical use of 'trivial' monetary incentives in the game. Critics propose that PD Ss under imaginary or trivial incentive conditions compete primarily because they become bored with cooperation. Incentive magnitude for 100 male and 100 female Ss playing the same basic 20-trial PD game was varied. In 5 experimental conditions, Ss played for imaginary dollars, small and intermediate amounts of real money, and real dollars. Results indicated that (1) cooperation tended to decrease over time in all conditions, (2) Ss who played for real money played quite competitively regardless of incentive magnitude, and (3) Ss who played for real dollars were significantly more, rather than less, competitive than were Ss who played for imaginary dollars. Results fail to support the 'insufficient incentive to cooperate' criticisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"72 Ss played a Prisoner's Dilemma game against a 'dummy' who played either a 50 or a 75% cooperative strategy on a preplanned and random basis over 110 iterations of the game. Ss were in 1 of 3 message credibility conditions: a promise to cooperate which was sent by the 'dummy' on every 10th trial was kept 90, 60, or 30% of the time. Difference in strategies did not affect the strategy selections of the Ss. Ss who received the most highly credible messages cooperated more often on the message trials, were more willing to reciprocate promises, and displayed more 'trust' than did Ss in either of the other 2 credibility conditions. Strategy  Credibility interactions were found on overall cooperative strategy selections, cooperations on the message trials, and 'forgiveness.' (24 ref.)

"64 students played against a preplanned 50% unpatterned set of strategies selected by a 'dummy other' in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. The experimental conditions were no feedback, cumulative feedback of scores for self, for other, and for self and other.

Results indicate that ideographic factors are important in the early trials but that the logic of the conflict situation soon becomes compelling to Ss. (15 ref.)

NONE OF THE CONDITIONS PRODUCED DIFFERENCES EITHER IN THE DYADIC ANALYSES OR IN THE INDIVIDUAL ANALYSES. HOWEVER, WHEN ONLY THOSE SS WHO PREDICTED BETTER THAN CHANCE WERE CHOSEN (REALISTS), THEY WERE FOUND TO COOPERATE LESS THAN EITHER THE NONREALISTS OR THE NONPREDICTORS.

"In Exp. I it was found that the amount of shock endured was grossly linear to the exchange value in cents and that clear distinctions were made between amounts of shock by 11 male and 11 female Ss drawn from sophomore college classes. In Exp. II a new sample of 40 male and 40 female Ss was introduced by like-sexed pairs to a 2-choice Prisoner's Dilemma-type game with money and shock as payoff. ½ of the pairs received money, then the shock payoff; ½ received shock, then the money payoff. Contrary to expectation, no difference was observed between shock and money games when other factors were held constant. However, in contrast to games with money alone as payoff, the level of cooperative choice was rather high, and a significant sex effect emerged with male pairs being significantly more cooperative than female. The shock-then-money sequence provoked most clearly the sex difference. Other observations suggest that women are less tolerant of shock and, thus, provoked more into a competitive posture thereby than are men. (15 ref.)

"Studies using experimental games, and particularly studies of the other person's strategy, can add to understanding of variables affecting behavior in conflict situations. The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game has been most used in such studies because its structure uniquely resembles many real-life conflict situations. Results of PD studies have often not been differentiated from those using games with different structures. However, a review of the literature on strategy effects shows many differences in results between PD and Chicken, Quasi-PD games, Asymmetrical PD games, other asymmetrical games, Maximizing Difference games, and a wide variety of other matrix games and procedures.

"Examined the nature of 'rationality' in a mixed-motive game and determined if Ss' self-reported motives were related to their choices in the game. Choices and postexperimental questionnaire answers from 3 Prisoner's Dilemma studies were analyzed. Significant chi-square relationships emerged in each case, with motives and behavior related in the expected direction. An unexpected finding was the substantial percentage of Ss (up to 44%) whose motive was neither cooperation, competition, nor maximization of differences.

The free-play condition produced significantly less cooperation than all other conditions. The relatively small differences among the other conditions were probably due to the overriding effects of the tit-for-tat strategy with which Ss all concluded.

"Factors which increased cooperation include: the academic involvement produced by small classes and belief in the legitimacy of psychological research produced by the content of psychology courses; a small amount of social interaction between the Ss at the beginning of the experiment; the public commitment involved in stating a norm, i.e., that cooperation in the game is desirable; the S-males were more cooperative than females; and the desire to compete, over time within the span of 30 trials. The average pay-off/trial has a significant effect on the level of cooperation. The degree of friendship between the Ss, and instructions labeling the experiment as dealing with cooperation and competition have no effect on the level of cooperation. (25 ref.)

"Administered a battery of personality tests, including the Adjective Check List, to 60 male Berkeley students and 40 Berkeley ROTC cadets. Ss then participated in 41 trials of an extended 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma game. Each S believed he was the captain of 1 of 2 teams playing each other. During the 1st 20 trials Ss played against a hostile, noncooperative stooge. In the last 21 trials, experimental Ss received either group pressure to cooperate or defect from their own team or an offer of cooperation from the artifactual adversary. Control conditions paired players for true feedback after the 1st 20 programmed trials. Results indicate that the 1st 20 trials successfully induced a high level of defection in most Ss, especially for ROTC Ss. Offer of cooperation induced cooperation among non-ROTC Ss, and group pressure was successful with ROTC Ss. Even under control conditions the non-ROTC Ss tended to break out of their deadlock while the ROTC Ss did not. Analysis of the personality measures revealed that the factors of 'hippiness' and activism were higher for the non-ROTC group, while task-directedness characterized ROTC Ss. It is concluded that results justify the 'hip' designation for the students and suggest a type of individual difference frequently overlooked in relating personality to Prisoner's Dilemma performance.

"Prisoner's Dilemma and a Maximizing Difference game (in which a noncooperative choice may result in an outcome that provides S with a higher score than his opponent, but which nonetheless lowers his absolute score) were applied to adult tribal Africans of varying degrees of Westernization. Westernized Ss showed less cooperation than traditional Ss in the Prisoner's Dilemma but not in the Maximizing Difference game. Traditional and Westernized Ss manifested greater similarity to their partners in the Maximizing Difference game than in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Results lead to appraising individualism-conformity as a very important dimension, to concluding that several dimensions are involved simultaneously, and to contending that results depend on the structure of the situation in which interaction occurs.

"Investigated the propensity to cooperate in single plays of 3 game structures (Chicken, No Conflict, and Prisoner's Dilemma) under 2 conditions of commitment to future interaction, using 2 experimental environments. In addition, the effects of negative payoffs and the opportunity to maximize relative rather than absolute gain were examined. 320 business administration undergraduates served as Ss. Results show that committed Ss were more cooperative in all 3 structures than uncommitted Ss. The propensity to cooperate was greatest for the No Conflict structure, weakest for the Prisoner's Dilemma structure, and intermediate for the Chicken structure. The largest difference between committed and uncommitted Ss in the propensity to cooperate was observed for the Prisoner's Dilemma structure. A comparison of these results with repeated play studies supports the use of single play studies of social interaction for analyzing the effects of social structure on behavior.

No relationship was found between the Rotter Interpersonal Trust Scale and the Prisoner's Dilemma.

"30 PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS PLAYED 100 TRIALS OF A PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAME AND COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE GIVING INDICATORS OF (1) THEIR OWN AND THEIR FATHER'S SOCIAL POSITION, (2) THEIR ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AND (3) EXPECTATIONS OF CHANGE FOR THE SELF AND THE NATION. SEX WAS THE ONLY INDICATOR OF SOCIAL POSITION OF THE SS THEMSELVES WHICH DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN THEM.

"In an attempt to explain cooperation within the dyad in terms of reinforcement theory, 2 groups of 10 dyads each received monetary gains while engaging in a cooperative reaction-time game; 2 similar groups were not rewarded, but sustained losses. Immediately following this reaction-time game, 1 of the rewarded groups and 1 of the nonrewarded groups played a series of 60 consecutive Prisoner's Dilemma games, a task in which one may either cooperate or compete. A comparison of Ss who were rewarded during the reaction-time game with Ss who had no previous experience within the dyad indicated that the rewards received during the initial task increased the probability of a cooperative response during the Prisoner's Dilemma game, and that this effect persevered over time. The results also indicated that losses sustained during the reaction-time game did not increase or decrease the number of cooperative responses in the group tested immediately but did increase such responses in the group tested 1 wk. later.

"40 male undergraduates possessed a unilateral power advantage over a simulated opponent in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. In response to the Ss' threats demanding a cooperative response, the simulated target's verbally announced behavioral intentions and his subsequent responses were manipulated in a 2  2 factorial design: Honest-Compliant, Honest-Defiant, Dishonest-Compliant, and Dishonest-Defiant. Ss sent more threats to a compliant than a defiant target. When the target was Honest-Compliant, he converted the Ss into mutual cooperators; but when he was Dishonest-Compliant, Ss exploited him. While behavioral defiance generally inhibited Ss from sending threats, when the defiant target used deceit in the form of announcing intentions to comply, he induced Ss to make themselves vulnerable to exploitation.

"Investigated the nature of the interaction between cooperative and competitive persons. It was hypothesized that cooperative behavior would decrease over time in an interaction between the 2. Ss were 60 male undergraduates. Pairs, in which 1 S was competitive and the other cooperative, played 30 trials of a Prisoner's Dilemma game. 3 experimental conditions were created by varying the nature of the information each S received about his partner's orientation. A decrease in cooperative behavior was found only when Ss believed that their (dissimilarly motivated) partner had the same orientation as themselves. When Ss had veridical information about their partner's dissimilar orientation, there was a significant increase in cooperative behavior over time for both members. When Ss has no information about their partner's goal orientation, cooperative behavior remained stable over time. Data are discussed in terms of the active vs passive role taken by Ss in transforming interpersonal situations which they confront. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Hypothesized that (a) males would be more cooperative and more imitative of each other than would females in the Prisoner's Dilemma game; and (b) when given the opportunity to communicate, males would talk about strategy matters and consequently enhance their levels of cooperation and imitation, while females would discuss nonstrategic matters and show less change in their game behavior. These hypotheses were supported with data from 30 male and 30 female undergraduates. Sex composition of the dyad and communication opportunities were varied over 6 blocks and 30 trials each. Results suggest that males are success-oriented and play opportunistically, and cooperative behavior on their part is an attempt to maximize their gains. Females appear more socially-oriented, and their choice of the competitive response may be a defensive measure in a situation where their primary goal of social interaction is restricted.

"Investigated the relationship of moral judgment to maladaptive aggression among 76 male institutionalized psychiatric patients and a comparison group of 38 male college students. It was expected that the lower levels of moral reasoning would be associated with maladaptive aggression in an experimental situation. The dependent measure was derived from having Ss play a modified version of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Each S was given 10 'zap' options which, if exercised, enabled him to (maladaptively) aggress against the other player at a cost to himself. Results suggest a direct relationship between level of moral reasoning and observable maladaptive aggression in the predicted direction. Findings are discussed in relation to problems in aggression research methodology. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"43 hospitalized acting-out and 56 normal 15-18 yr olds participated in a 30-trial prisoner's dilemma bargaining game in 1 of 2 feedback conditions. In the lapsed saint (LS) strategy, the other player assumed an unconditionally cooperative manner and then switched to a more competitive stance. The reformed sinner (RS) assumed a competitive strategy and then became cooperative. While both groups were similar in their choices on initial trials, differences in game-playing behavior occurred on later trials. As predicted, the normal Ss showed significantly higher levels of cooperation in the RS condition than in the LS condition, while the hospitalized Ss did not. The hospitalized Ss tended to be higher in suspicion in the RS condition and higher in risk-taking in the LS condition than normals. Moreover, the acting-out Ss showed less overall exploitation than normals. Sex differences revealed a complex pattern of interaction with population and strategy; however, females cooperated more than males on later trials.

"Administered 20 trials of the Prisoner's Dilemma game to study sociometric conflict among 150 elementary school children, classified in 3 social levels (approximately low, medium, and high). No significant results were obtained between pupils at these primary school ages. Attitude and personality differences of the different class levels did not appear to affect the Ss' approach to the simple rules of the game.

"Nonrandomly selected 80 male Ss, 40 8-13 yr old whites from families of fairly high financial means and 40 11-16 yr old African Zambians from poor schools and financially needy families. Ss played the Prisoner's Dilemma game, calculated to reveal cooperative and competitive responses. To test desire for absolute gain, Zambian Ss also played a game entitling players who threw high numbers in dice to take either 1 sweet from E or 2 from an incoming 'victim.' In contrast to the emphasis in Zambia upon cooperation and deemphasis upon competitive and exploitive behavior, analysis of variance results revealed no significant differences between whites and African Zambians. Larger variance among Zambians, though, suggested a conflict between traditional and competitive norms. In the subsidiary experiment of throwing a die, Zambians acted no differently from European Ss in the same circumstances and gave no evidence of altruistic behavior. Reported absence of cooperation and altruism in these games suggests that Zambian philosophy may need revision when these children become adults.

Ss faced 1 of 4 types of opponents programed by E to be either honest or dishonest and cooperative or competitive. Postgame ratings indicated that a majority of Ss perceived the opponent as competitive and honest regardless of the opponent's actual behavior. Ss' perception was significantly associated with their cooperative behavior, with accurate perceivers being less cooperative than inaccurate perceivers. The greater competitiveness of accurate perceivers was tentatively explained as a function of their more extensive use of the cues generated directly by the experimental context.

About 30 experiments and about 10 other publications are cited about aspects of human behavior during the PDG. A summary of the studies indicates that (a) after about 30 trials had been played, men became more cooperative than women in game experiments; and (b) the male reactions to opponent's behavior were more adequate than those of female players. It is concluded that men are more motivated to win the game while women are more oriented to the interpersonal aspects of the situation. Some studies found that women were more influenced by the attractiveness of the opponent than the men. Also women's behavior was less rational than that of men in trying to make irrational manipulations seem sensible.

"Defined both unreciprocated cooperation and the rewarding of cooperation at a cost to oneself as martyrlike behavior within the structure of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. 78 17-28 yr. olds completed the Adjective Check List (ACL), a shame-guilt test, and a tolerance for ambiguity measure. The effect of exposure to martyrlike behavior was available both in the form of the Ss' play in the game (overt behavior) and a change in attitudes (covert behavior). Results demonstrate that the individual's ego ideal is more important than his superego as a factor predicting his tendency to be positively influenced by martyrdom. Measures of self-esteem and of attitudes that can predict such positive responses in 2 stages were developed. The measure predicts the individual's attitudes, and the individual's attitudes predict influence. No relationship was established between trends toward an authoritarian personality and response to martyrlike behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Presented a 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma game to a total of 216 undergraduates, to test several hypotheses derived from M. Fishbein's extension of Dulany's theory of propositional control. According to the theory, a persuasive message will influence a player's behavioral intention, and hence his behavior, only if it affects either his attitude toward the act (A-act) and/or his normative beliefs (i.e., his perception of the other player's expectations) multiplied by his motivation to comply with the norms, expressed algebraically as NBs (Mcs). Persuasive messages were directed at either A-act or NBs. Orthogonal to the message type, 2 motivational orientations were created, cooperation and competition. Consistent with earlier findings, A-act was found to be more important than NBs (Mcs) in predicting behavioral intentions and behavior under competition, but less important than NBs (Mcs) under cooperation. Results also support the hypothesis that the attitudinal message would change behavior more effectively in the competitive situation, while the normative message would be more effective in cooperative groups.

It was shown the nature of partner image determines specific dominant behavior, e.g., cooperation with a human partner, defensive reaction with a mechanical one.

"Varied accomodative or exploitative strategies of a simulated source of threats and compellant or deterrent wordings of the threat in a 2  2  2 orthogonal design. 20 male and 20 female undergraduates participated in a message-modified version of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Results indicate that when a threatening simulated source was accommodative following the sending of a threat, the target was more compliant to the threat and informed the source of his intention to comply more frequently than when the source employed an exploitative strategy. Results are interpreted in terms of the signaling capacities of threats when followed by subsequent beneficent behavior of the source. Compellant wording of a threat was found to (a) heighten the perception of a hostile and exploitative source, (b) increase compliance to threats, and (c) cause the target to try to deceive the source with statements of intention. Overall, females were more cooperative than males, but in the compellant-exploitative condition they were much less cooperative. (28 ref.)

"Tested the formulation of R. S. Wyer (see record [rid]1970-02267-001[/rid]) of behavior in 2-person games, which predicts responses as a function of 3 descriptive parameters of the payoff matrix and the expectancy for how the other (O) will respond. An experiment with 120 undergraduates systematically manipulated payoff values in the matrices to which Ss were exposed, and used a simulated O who responded in a predetermined random sequence. Effects over a series of 50 trials were generally consistent with predictions. However, quantitative predictions of individual Ss' behavior were fairly inaccurate. Additional data indicate that, at least in Prisoner's Dilemma games, quantitative predictions of behavior were substantially more accurate when Ss interacted with real rather than simulated Os. The tendency for Ss to reciprocate cooperative behavior appeared to be less when O was simulated. These differences occurred despite the fact that between-group comparisons showed no difference between the effects of playing with real and simulated Os. Differences are tentatively attributed to a decreased utility attached by Ss to the points received by O under simulated conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Investigated the influence of context upon attitude toward a gazing person. 50 male undergraduates played a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game with a confederate whose gaze (constant vs. no gaze) and cooperativeness (100% cooperative, 90% cooperative, and 100% competitive) were manipulated in a 2  3 factorial design. The 1st part of the study found that Ss' ratings of the confederate on liking and partner preference were significantly affected by cooperativeness but not by gaze. Significant Gaze  Cooperation interactions occurred for Ss' self-ratings on friendly-hostile and cooperative-competitive scales. Ss in the 100% competitive-gaze and 100% cooperative-no gaze groups saw themselves as friendly and cooperative, while Ss in the 100% competitive-no gaze and 100% cooperative-gaze groups gave hostile and competitive self-ratings. Although Ss in the 100% competitive-gaze condition rated themselves as cooperative, their actual PD game behavior was highly competitive. Part 2 of the study supported the hypothesis of A.

"Studied the status positions of both source and target in a conflict situation in which the source uses threats as a means of coercing the target's compliance. The Prisoner's Dilemma game was modified to permit sending an occasional threat from a simulated source to target Ss. 120 ROTC cadets of varying ranks (status) assumed the position of targets and allegedly played other cadets. 4 source-target conditions were used: low-high, high-low, low-low, and high-high. The source's threats were 10, 50, or 90% credible and carried either high or low punishment for noncompliance. The major findings of this study were: (a) target Ss, irrespective of own status, complied more often to the threats of a high-status source than to threats issued by a low-status source; (b) as credibility of threats increased, the degree of compliance obtained increased; (c) as punishment magnitude associated with threats increased, compliance increased; (d) high-status Ss exploited the low-status simulated player more often in the game than did Ss in the other 3 status conditions; and (e) the perceived potency of the threatener was directly related to the credibility of his threats.

Results from 48 female undergraduates show an increasing amount of cooperation through all 4 conditions, especially when Ss could see each other.

"Of 200 college students, 24 who were at the upper and lower 10th percentiles on Bieri's test of cognitive complexity were selected out. High cognitive complexity Ss demonstrated highly differentiated constructs. Both groups played against E in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, ostensibly playing against another S. Overall, high rather than low cognitive complexity Ss emitted more cooperative responses, although there was a significant tendency for all Ss to make fewer cooperative responses as the experiment progressed. The type of strategy employed against Ss had no significant effect on their behavior either directly or in interaction with the complexity differences or the trials effect. The strategy employed by the simulated other had no overall or differential effect on either group. It is possible that no effects were observed because Ss were not aware of the differences in the other person's strategies. The fact that low cognitive complexity Ss made more competitive responses under all conditions would seem to indicate that when the opportunity to increase their own gain occurred they utilized it even when that meant decreasing the other person's gains. High cognitive complexity Ss were more likely to use a strategy that resulted in a more equitable distribution of payoffs if their opponent was cooperative, or one that minimized their own losses if he was not.

The game was presented to 176 undergraduates as a simulated arms race peace race dilemma with the units of cooperation being conversions from missiles to factories. The effects on cooperation of the following factors were studied: (1) making predictions of the other player's behavior, (2) the sex of the player, (3) S's belief about the sex of the other player, and (4) a contrived feedback in which S's own cooperation level was matched by a stooge. It was concluded that games in which players were asked to predict the moves of the other were significantly less conducive to cooperation than nonprediction games. There were no overall differences in cooperation rates between males and females. However, females were less accurate in their prediction of other's behavior, and less sensitive to the other player's strategy. The false feedback condition using a strategy which matched S's own level of coopertaion was significantly more conducive to cooperation than a contrasted group of natural pairs.

Effects on performance of variance among 4 independent variables (sex, initial position of inequality, amplitude of inequality, and external options for reducing inequality) were analyzed. Data analyses point to the existence of diverse dimensions of inequality which, when studied in relation to Ss' responses to conflict and negotiation, are not necessarily levels on an 'inequality' continuum but appear to represent heterogeneous influences on habit and should be studied as such.

"Conducted 2 experiments using a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game with 40 male undergraduates to investigate determinants of target compliance to escalatory and deescalatory influence strategies during a 2-person, mixed-motive conflict simulation. Both experiments involved the intermittent transmission of contingent threats of punishment with varying magnitudes from a robot to target Ss. In Exp I, an escalatory (increasing) pattern of threats and punishments was employed, and in Exp II, a deescalatory (decreasing) pattern was used. Escalation and deescalation were implemented noncontingently by robot, or gradually and contingent on target's response to previous influence exertion. Escalation of punishments was far more effective in eliciting compliance overall than was deescalation; these differences persisted within both the sudden and gradual conditions. Consistent with a utility analysis, however, sudden deescalation was not significantly less efficient in gaining compliance than gradual deescalation.

"Same- and mixed-sex dyads of 39 female and 53 male undergraduates played 100 trials of a maximizing difference game in a replication of an experiment in which S. P. McNeel et al (see record [rid]1973-09065-001[/rid]) used Flemish Ss. In contrast to the Belgian investigation, and in line with earlier experiments in the US which had used the Prisoner's Dilemma game, it was found that the like-sex female dyads were most competitive, followed by the like-sex male dyads. The males and females in the mixed-sex dyads were least competitive and not different from one another. Simply being paired with a female had an immediate effect on the males, but the females appeared to be more affected by the response strategy of the males. It is argued that the most likely factor accounting for the results was the greater use of 'tit-for-tat' responding by the males.

"Conducted 4 preliminary experiments with high school students as Ss on cooperation in N-person (6-10) nonconstant-sum games to determine whether the frequency of cooperative actions (Strategy C) depended on the profitability of the choices involved, on information about outcome after each choice, on communication between partners, and on the mutual attitude of the partners; Ss were also able to use individual action strategy (Strategy D). Results show that (a) opportunities for communication between players increased the frequency of choices only in games of the Prisoner's Dilemma type in which the formation of a 2-3 person coalition made the C choice profitable, (b) cooperation level was higher in groups comprising Ss favorably disposed to each other than in groups with Ss without such disposition, and (c) level of cooperation did not affect information about the outcomes of each game. One of the weaknesses of the preliminary is that the payoff matrices did not create a clear-cut conflict of interest (too-low payoffs, not sufficiently differentiated).

"Examined the effects of social feedback (praise and criticism) as well as opponent's strategy on the cooperation of 80 same-sex pairs of undergraduates who played 40 trials of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Feedback was seen by Ss as administered by a peer or E and was either praise of criticism. There were 5 feedback conditions: peer praise, E praise, peer criticism, E criticism, and a neutral control condition. The opponent's strategy was programed by E to be either Honest-Cooperative, Honest-Competitive, Dishonest-Cooperative, or Dishonest-Competitive. Analysis indicated that feedback was generally effective in increasing cooperation beyond that in the control group. However, with a competitive opponent, only E praise led to increased cooperation. It is suggested that the clarity of the feedback agent's role is crucial and that ambiguous motives may diminish the effectiveness of his feedback.

The PS orientation to the neutral confederate was predicted to be intermediate. A forced-choice seating measure showed significantly different PS orientations in the predicted direction. The effects were due largely to the cooperative treatment, with neutral and competitive treatments showing no significant differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Used the choice behavior of 96 male undergraduates in 2 types of mixed-motive games to classify Ss according to their predominant goal orientation. Ss with competitive (relative gain) goals and those with individualistic (own gain) goals were then presented with 50 decomposed Prisoner's Dilemma games in which they interacted with a conditionally cooperative other. Some Ss saw their own and the other person's outcomes displayed on each trial (Other condition) while others also saw a bogus average outcome (Average condition). The latter outcome was constructed such that comparison with it made the mutually competitive outcomes 'look bad' and the mutually cooperative outcomes 'look good.' On the basis of social-comparisons, it was predicted that relative-gain Ss would learn to cooperate in the Average condition but not in the Other condition. Own-gain Ss were expected to show high levels of cooperation overall and to cooperate sooner in the Average condition than in the Other condition. Predictions were significant only for own-gain Ss, though they were also in the expected direction for relative-gain Ss. The problems of using social-comparison processes as a basis for training Ss to be cooperative are discussed, with emphasis placed on the issue of the relevance of the available comparisons.

"Selected an experimental group of 20 boys from a children's home and a matched control group of 20 Ss from normal families.

He either replicated the S's choice, or was more benevolent or more malevolent than the S. The 'own home' Ss showed an overall higher level of cooperation than the institutionalized Ss, especially when the stooge played a benevolent strategy. Under all strategies, institutionalized Ss showed marked resistance to change from competitive to cooperative choices. They were often unable to cope with a situation when there was a disagreement between the strategic context and the partner's choice. The institutionalized Ss were less easily taken in than the 'own home' Ss by the seemingly cooperative behavior of the stooge. (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Assuming that the extent to which a concession (or a conciliatory act) is exploited or reciprocated depends upon the situational context in which the concession is made, the effects of 2 situational variables on cooperative choice were investigated: (a) the length of the competitive stalemate prior to conciliatory acts and (b) the consequence or cost to the party initiating such acts. 155 male undergraduates, scheduled in pairs, were led to believe they were playing a Prisoner's Dilemma game, but were playing against a preprogramed strategy of the E. The dependent variable was the level of cooperation on the last block of trials. Results suggest that (a) a long stalemate initiated by a sequence of competitive acts may be effective against a competitive person, but not against a cooperative person; and (b) conciliatory acts which are costly may facilitate the communication and perception of cooperative intent and thereby facilitate a mutually cooperative solution.

"40 female undergraduates were the targets of conciliatory initiatives from a simulated source during 70 Prisoner's Dilemma trials. The source had available to her either a promise to cooperate on the following trial or that promise with a threat of punishment if the target did not cooperate on the following trial. The threat was sent once. All Ss received 20 promises which were either 50 or 100% truthful. Ss were more cooperative on promise trials if the source had threat capability than if she had only the promise; the former was evaluated more positively than the latter.

"Hypothesized that heightening ingroup cohesion would increase discrimination toward an outgroup. This prediction was not supported. Instead, it was found that for the most part, only high cohesiveness elicits differential biases toward ingroup and outgroup. 44 male undergraduates were randomly assigned to pairs in either a low or high cohesiveness condition. The experimental task was a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game where the participants were 2 dyads rather than 2 individuals. Members of high-cohesive groups were more cooperative toward comembers than toward an outgroup; moreover, they evaluated their comembers more positively than outgroup members. In contrast, low-cohesive groups failed to exhibit either tendency toward greater ingroup favoritism. Results are tentatively interpreted in terms of a cognitive differentiation hypothesis suggesting that (a) cohesiveness leads group members to cognitively differentiate ingroup from outgroup and (b) ingroup-outgroup differentiation is a necessary and sufficient condition for eliciting intergroup bias.

"Assigned 72 male and 72 female undergraduates to male, female, and mixed-sex dyads which played 100 trials of a 2-choice, mixed-motive game that allowed behavioral separation of the relative gain orientation (desire to win or not lose) from that of individualism. An additional variable, which showed no significant main effects, was manipulated: 1/2 of the dyads were able to see the other player, while the other 1/2 were visually isolated. While females were consistently less relative gain oriented than males, this result was not strong enough to be significant. Hence, the prediction that females are more individualistically oriented than males rather than more 'competitive' (as has been suggested by researchers employing the Prisoner's Dilemma game) was not strongly supported. In the mixed-sex dyads, it was expected that all Ss would show a decreased tendency to compete compared to like-sex dyads. However, only males showed a significant decrease in competition, and only when they had competed previously themselves. Results suggest that, for males, but not females, differentiation of sex roles in mixed-sex interactions reduces the likelihood and/or impact of comparison of outcomes. (19 ref.)

Ss were 60 14-16 yr. old boys who played in dyads for 11/2 hr. at the Prisoner's Dilemma Game. 5 times during the game Ss rated their opponents on their game behavior on the 12 scales of the Semantic Differential (Dutch version). The lst rating occurred at the start and the remainder at various intervals and at the end of the contest. The unusable scales were discarded by the Ss. The independent variable was the dichotomizing of the scales with respect to meaningfulness. The rbis was used to determine significance. The difference in rating extremity of the meaningful versus meaningless scales was highly significant, confirming the hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Irrespective of parental occupation, Ss responded to the cost-gain features of the situation. Entrepreneurial Ss cooperated more frequently than did bureaucratic Ss.

"Hypothesized that the threat of electrical shock external to the point structure of the Prisoner's Dilemma game would be more analogous to everyday interactions of individuals and nations. A total of 104 undergraduates participated in the game in the usual manner or with the addition of a shock and/or warning switch. Results indicate that a bilateral possession of power and the ability to punish increased cooperative behavior. The presence or absence of a warning button did not significantly increase the amount of cooperative behavior over that of the shock alone condition. When both Ss were males, the presence of warning actually reduced the amount of cooperativeness. Results support the hypothesis; the ability to retaliate rather than the symbol or warning of retaliation increased cooperative behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"72 male and 72 female undergraduates played a Prisoner's Dilemma game, modified to include occasional promises to the S stating that he would be given extra points if he cooperated on the next trial. The probability and magnitude of promised reward and the overall cooperativeness of the promisor were manipulated. Females cooperated more and evaluated the promisor more favorably than did males. It is concluded that the norm of reciprocity overrode the effects of the manipulations on compliance for the reason that the promisor was unconditionally accommodative on the promise trials. An indirect relationship between ratings of the promisor's potency and his rewardingness was obtained. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Replicated the study of M. Deutsch and R. M.

Analyses of test scores and results from a semantic differential questionnaire indicate that: (a) the ST was considered less potent in the unilateral test condition than in either of the other 2 conditions; (b) Ss chose to penalize STs more often in the retaliatory condition; (c) the use of threats did not affect the overall competitiveness or winnings; and (d) males cooperated less, won more, and were generally more aggressive than females in the use of threats and penalties.

"Describes the research methodology and results of a study of individual choice in conflict situations. The objective was to develop a theory of choice which could explain decisions in terms of variables subject to external control. Graduate and undergraduate students played various forms of the Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken games. The choice- and policy-matching theories were examined. Role-reversal theory that an S selects the choice he believes his opponent would select if the opponent were in his place provided the most accurate predictions. However, none of the theories predicted well when the S's attitude toward the game was favorable and toward his opponent was unfavorable. Subjective estimates of belief and attitude were made and various objective measures attempted. A teaching hypothesis that S would try to change the opponent's choices through various means was investigated and provided a slight improvement in prediction. Application of theories to larger games maintained the superiority of the role-reversal theory for prediction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Choice behavior in games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma reveals Americans as maximizing gains when self-estimate was high, while Italians maximized gains when self-estimate was low. The present study manipulated ethical values through dispensing initial just or unjust reward, followed by a game in which monetary rewards depended upon which of 4 joint choices occurred in a standard 'payoff' matrix. American Ss initially rewarded on the basis of stated merit tended to retain that position in the game. They appeared to believe the stated differences in ability and to act accordingly. In contrast, Italian Ss showed a tendency to equalize payoff for both Ss under such circumstances. Both Americans and Italians tended to reduce inequity in the game when 1 member was arbitrarily rewarded initially. Data are open to varied interpretations.

"Modified the Prisoner's Dilemma game so that 72 male and 72 female 5th and 6th graders payed a simulated player who communicated occasional promises of a extra reward if the cooperative choice was made on the next trial. Ss were assigned to promise credibility conditions of 10, 50, and 90%; reward levels of $5, $10, and $20; and simulated strategies which were either 50 or 90% cooperative over the 100 trials. There was less compliance to the promise when it was only 10% credible; compliance was greater when the $20 reward was offered. Ss were more cooperative overall when the simulated player was 90% cooperative. Males were more cooperative than females, especially when the simulated player was 90% cooperative. The development of moral considerations and the capacity to take the other's viewpoint, as proposed by Piaget, were suggested to explain the results when no such effects had been found in a previous study using adult Ss who uniformly reciprocated the simulated player's helpfulness. The Ss' behavioral sensitivity to variation in reward probability and magnitude were consistent with H. A. Witkin's conclusions regarding the field dependence of children. (17 ref.)

"Based on results from previous experiments using the Prisoner's Dilemma game, it is inferred that cooperators will believe others are heterogeneous as to their cooperativeness vs. competitiveness, whereas competitors will believe other persons are uniformly competitive. Evidence relating to authoritarianism, and from a variety of experimental situations is found to confirm this inference. Low authoritarians tend to behave like cooperators in experimental game situations and to have beliefs about other persons similar to the cooperators' beliefs, whereas high authoritarians exhibit behavior and beliefs consistent with those of competitors. Results illustrate what may be a common phenomenon in personality and social psychology, that a personality predisposition acts through its influence upon the person's social behavior to determine the information he gains from his social environment and, thereby, the beliefs he comes to hold about his world.

"4 experiments with a total of 42 male and 48 female undergraduates and 48 female high school students, investigated the consistency of cooperative or competitive behavior of Ss in 2 different experimental situations. Ss who had behaved either extremely competitively or extremely cooperatively in a Game of Chicken or a Prisoner's Dilemma game were tested in 1 of 2 conditions: (a) a mixed-motive task where payoff was obtained through a series of steps which the other player could block (the Paddle Game), or (b) a picture-interpretation task involving story writing and discussion in dyads. In the Paddle Game, most Ss cooperated, but previous high competitors waited less often for their turn, were usually paid 1st, and in 1 experiment, earned more money. In the picture-interpretation task, few behavioral differences were found between cooperators and competitors, but pairs of competitors were in greater agreement in their story interpretations and portrayed more cynicism about interpersonal relationships than did others. Female cooperator pairs showed high agreement and low cynicism. This suggests that competitors may share certain views, different from cooperators, about interpersonal relationships. However, the findings do not justify broad generalizations from behavior in experimental games to other interpersonal situations. (26 ref.)

"Small samples of British (n = 57) and American (n = 20) university students were compared in attitudes toward social risk, tolerance for ambiguity, worldmindedness, and in competiveness of strategic choices. Competitive strategic choices were represented by choices to play in Prisoner's Dilemma games that offered higher rewards for competitive behavior. British Ss showed a greater preference for such competitive opportunities, but no consistent differences were found for other measures. Relations found in earlier studies between competitive matrix preference and the other personality measures were also present within these samples.

"A cross-national research program on determinants in the decision-making process, emphasizing the relationship between self-esteem and the competitive behavior observed in an experimental game such as the Prisoner's Dilemma. Ss were American, French, and Italian students selected for high or low self-esteem. The research 'indicates that competitive choice behavior of Ss who are dependent on each other for rewards is determined by (1) an equity seeking tendency, and (2) a self-compensatory or defensive tendency.' Since a 'defensive pattern of competitiveness occurred in both French and Italian samples, no exclusively cultural basis can be claimed for this category of response. According to the self-ratings on personality it appears that American students have higher levels of self-esteem than either of the 2 European samples.'

"Internationalist and isolationist Ss played a 2-part modification of the Prisoner's-Dilemma-type game. Though they did not know it, they were actually playing against E, rather than each other. In the 1st part of the experiment, Ss had little control over the payoff matrix. In the 2nd part, Ss had virtually total control over the payoffs. During the 1st part of the experiment, E played a 'cooperative' strategy against ½ of the Ss and a 'competitive' strategy against the other ½. The results indicated that neither the strategy played against Ss nor the personality of Ss influenced the number of cooperative choices.

"Past research suggested that females appear less cooperative when playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game (PD) because they are less likely than males to adopt a strategy that guides behavior over trials. This inference served as the basis for speculating that females (more than males) would be influenced by whether or not alternatives in the PD were labeled 'cooperation' or 'competition,' a variable that should affect the ease with which strategies could be generated. 40 undergraduates served as Ss. Results supported the hypothesis in that females 'learned' a cooperative orientation more quickly when alternatives were labeled, while this variable did not affect the behavior of males.

In evaluating power relations Ss apparently used other criteria in addition to objective power, including aspects of interaction. Evidence is presented that superior power was accurately perceived only when it was actually used.

"The response of groups to the experience of coping with resource dilemmas has been an object of study by scholars in several of the social and behavioral sciences. Social norms, trust, and the perception of group identity form cooperative mechanisms critical to group cooperation. However, the opportunity to communicate has been singled out as the most important factor influencing group cooperation performance in resource dilemmas. Until recently, the content of that communication has undergone little examination. This article examines the relationships among topical and functional communication content, group performance, and participant perceptions of cooperative mechanisms in 97 experimental simulation groups. Detailed discussion of specific strategies was positively related, and discussion of general strategy, basic information exchange, and recapitulation of past occurrences in the simulation were negatively related to both amount of harvest from the resource pool and participant perceptions of equality norm emergence, trust, and group identity formation, among others. These perceptions were positively related with both the total amount and within-group equality of harvest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A resource dilemma is a circumstance in which an aggregate of people share a slowly replenishing resource pool out of which each person can harvest for her or his own use.

In a study of 97 experimental simulations of a group resource dilemma, procedural leadership and three types of substantive leadership (information giving, initiating, and evaluating) were consistently, although weakly, associated with total group harvesting and/or with participant judgments relevant to group cooperation.

"Many environmental problems are resource dilemmas that contain two components--social and temporal--that encourage individuals not to act in the best interest of the group. Most research has focused on the social component. The authors examined the importance of the temporal component in two resource dilemma tasks. Participants (N = 112) reported their willingness to limit resource consumption in response to hypothetical dilemmas and forfeited extra credit points in response to a real dilemma. Cooperation rates were higher when the temporal dilemma was diminished, when uncertainty about environmental impacts was low, and for women. Individuals high in both proenvironmentalism and consideration of future consequences sustained high levels of cooperation even in the face of strong temporal dilemmas.

"Experimental games are often used as models of social dilemmas in which small groups of players have unrestricted access to, and share, a common and finite resource of desirable goods in the absence of any binding coordination mechanism. Experimental studies of social dilemmas employ different protocols of play that differ from each other in terms of the information available to the Ss when they register their requests from the common resource. Using 2 experiments (N=62 and 38), this study focuses on the sequential protocol, where each Ss has complete information about his or her position and the total requests of the previous movers, and the positional protocol, where each Ss only knows his or her position, but has no information about the other's requests. In an attempt to characterize the nature and intensity of the position effect, a descriptive model with 1 free (individual specific) parameter was developed and tested. The parameter is estimated from the Ss' requests under the positional protocol and quantifies the social norm of 'advantage of the early mover'. In a range of cases examined, the model predicted very accurately individuals' requests in the sequential protocol (with full information about position and others' requests).

"This study focuses on a class of common pool resource (CPR) dilemmas that, in addition to strategic uncertainty about the harvesting behavior of the other group members, include environmental uncertainty about the size of the CPR. In an attempt to decrease the rate of requests from the common pool, and thereby increase individual payoffs, the authors extend previous research, both theoretically and experimentally, in two different directions. In the bonus treatment, a reward is given to the agent(s) who requests the least, and in the penalty treatment, a charge is imposed on the agent(s) who requests the most. They show that under equilibrium play the bonus treatment decreases total group request, whereas the penalty treatment increases it. The experimental results do not support this prediction. Rather, both treatments considerably decrease the rate of request and, therefore, increase the rate of provision. The penalty treatment is shown to be more effective in reducing individual requests and enhancing provision rates than is the bonus treatment.

"The present research investigated how individual differences in Extraversion and Agreeableness affect cooperation in an experimental resource dilemma. 72 university students shared access to a common pool of resources with 7 (simulated) others. Manipulated feedback indicated either that the common resource was being used at a sustainable rate or that it was being rapidly depleted. As predicted, Extraversion was generally negatively related to cooperation, whereas Agreeableness was generally positively related to cooperation, whereas individuals high in Extraversion and individuals low in Agreeableness were unresponsive to feedback regarding collective resource use, individuals low in Extraversion and individuals high in Agreeableness exercised more self-restraint when the common resource was severely threatened. Exploratory analyses revealed neither interactive effects of Extraversion and Agreeableness nor effects of individual differences in Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect. Together these results highlight the importance of individual differences in Extraversion and Agreeableness in social dilemma settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Investigated the effects of impression management in a resource dilemma situation. A resource dilemma is defined as a special case of social dilemma simulating a situation in which a group of individuals can 'harvest' resources from a common resource pool. Ss were 96 male college students majoring in psychology in Korea. Groups of 4 Ss were asked to harvest points from a replenishable resource pool. Two factors were crossed in a factorial design: group membership (ingroup vs outgroup membership) and feedback type (individual vs aggregated group level). The primary dependent measure was mean group harvest. The results show that the 2-way interaction effect was significant. Ss of the groups composed of outgroup members harvested more when feedback information was presented on the aggregated group level than when it was presented on the individual level.

"Investigated the relationship between environmental uncertainty and social value orientation in a replenishable resource dilemma paradigm. 172 undergraduates harvested units from a common resource pool over 20 trials. Two levels of social value orientation (cooperative, noncooperative) were crossed with 2 levels of replenishment rate uncertainty (low, high). As predicted, noncooperators harvested significantly more resources than cooperators and high uncertainty Ss harvested more resources than low uncertainty Ss. The primary finding was the hypothesized 3-way interaction among social value orientation, environmental uncertainty, and trials: Social value orientation moderated harvest decisions only under conditions of high uncertainty during the middle series of harvest trials. Noncooperators increased their harvests during this period, while cooperators harvested less and held their harvests constant across these trials. The results demonstrate that systematic individual differences exist in decision makers' responses to high environmental uncertainty. Social value orientation may exert its effect by influencing the scanning and processing of goal-relevant cues in this decision environment.

"Examined consumption behavior of groups of players sharing a common resource pool under 4 distinct protocols of play. Under the simultaneous protocol all Ss made their requests simultaneously. In the other 3 protocols, players made requests, one at a time, but with various types and levels of information about the process. In the sequential protocol, Ss made requests with complete information about their position in the sequence and full disclosure of previous requests. In the positional protocol, requests were made with precise information on one's position in the sequence order, but without disclosing the requests of previous players. Under the cumulative protocol, Ss made requests with complete information regarding the total previous requests but without knowing their exact position in the sequence. Ss were 87 undergraduates. A significant 'position effect' was found in all 3 nonsimultaneous protocols: mean individual requests and position in the sequence were negatively correlated, reflecting an 'early mover advantage' and a 'late mover handicap.' The effect was weakest in the positional protocol, whereas the sequential and cumulative protocols were practically identical. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Considered a noncooperative n-person resource dilemma game in which players can share a common and uncertain resource whose probability distribution is common knowledge. Making their requests from the pool privately with no preplay communication, 90 college students were granted their requests if, and only if, the total group request did not exceed the value of the unknown resource. This game was investigated under the sequential protocol of play and show that if positions in the sequence are fixed for all stage games and commonly known, the threat of retaliation against players requesting disproportionally large shares is sufficient to induce a more egalitarian distribution of requests. Acquisition of property rights, which is hypothesized to induce more skewed request distributions, was ineffective, presumably because of the relatively large group size, or lack of outcome feedback.

"Compared the predictive ability of several methods of assessing social values, including the Trust Scale (e.g., T. Yamagishi; see record [rid]1986-27153-001[/rid]) and an older measure of trust, the Fascism Scale. Social values, as assessed by G. P. Knight and A. R. Dubro's (see record [rid]1984-28710-001[/rid]) judgmental measurement technique, were predictive of resource dilemma behavior. Trust, measured with Yamagishi's Trust Scale, predicted contribution to public goods. The trust and social values scales were not correlated, suggesting that they are distinct concepts; however, the social value scales did not correlate with each other. A testable explanation for the results, centering on the nature of payoffs in the different games, is offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Conducted 2 experiments to examine the influence of conformity on samples of American students. In Exp 1, with 80 undergraduates, the mediating effects of punishment and a verbal warning on S conformity were examined. Ss were influenced by conformity regardless of the probability of punishment or the issuing of a verbal warning. In Exp 2, with 50 undergraduates, conformity could be explained by the desire to seek social information regarding how to play the game rather than by competitive tendencies. Ss conformed to the behavior of others even when it was against their best interest to do so. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"117 undergraduates harvested resource units from a common pool over 10 trials. Following the harvest trials, Ss evaluated and chose among several allocation systems for the 2nd session. The 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design crossed 2 levels of social value orientation (cooperative, noncooperative) with 2 levels of group resource use (extreme overuse, moderate overuse) and variance in others' purported harvests. A higher proportion of cooperative Ss voted for a superordinate authority system in the extreme overuse conditions compared to the moderate overuse conditions. The majority of noncooperators, however, rejected this structural change regardless of the state of the resource pool. Cooperators placed greater importance on the fairness dimension, while noncooperators assigned greater weight to the self-interest dimension in their evaluations of structural change alternatives.

In an initial study, an experimenter induced 1 of 3 emotions (happiness, sadness, or anger) or no emotion in 64 college students. Shortly thereafter, a 2nd experimenter asked each S to solve a resource dilemma problem. Ss in the sad and angry mood conditions were less successful than Ss in the happy or neutral mood conditions. In a 2nd study with 32 college students, the effect of a sad mood leading to less success than a neutral mood was replicated.

"45 undergraduates split into groups participated in 30 non-cooperative independent single-trial resource dilemmas. On each trial, Ss in each group privately requested several points from a common pool. Individual requests were granted if the total group request was equal to or smaller than the pool size. The pool size on each trial was sampled from a uniform distribution that was common knowledge. Asymmetry in payoff was induced by assigning to each group member a different points-to-money exchange rate. As the uncertainty about the pool size increased, Ss (1) overestimated the pool size, (2) increased their requests, and (3) expected others to increase their requests. Individual requests and expectations regarding others' requests were inversely related to the exchange rates, reflecting attempts to equate payoffs across group members.

"Sexual diversity is a fact of modern life. The challenges that human resources (HR) professionals face with changing workforce demographics include same-sex married couples’ demands for equal benefits and compensation for themselves and their families. These demands present a serious dilemma for HR professionals in the 21st century. With the federal government’s implementation of the Defense of Marriage Act and five states sanctioning same-sex marriage, the legal inequalities that exist between heterosexual and homosexual married couples has taken center stage in the political and social arenas. The purpose of the qualitative, phenomenological study was to explore the lived perceptions of same-sex married couples in two organizations, along with the exploration of the dilemma that HR professionals face while dealing with federal state and local laws that prohibit same-sex married couples from receiving comparable benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. The study involved 14 participants who completed a one-on-one interview involving 6 open-ended questions. The use of a modified van Kaam method by Moustakas (1994) helped to analyze the collected data. The results of the study showed that because justice is a concern of the nation’s government, and HR professionals play such an important role as the administrators of equality in the workplace, then HR professionals throughout the country should lobby the federal government for appropriate legislation to protect the rights of married partners, including single-sex married spouses and their families, from sexual discrimination in private and public institutions.

"Large-scale environmental issues, such as global warming, are difficult to resolve. Many people believe that the solution to global warming will require some form of structural solution. A structural solution transforms a social dilemma so that cooperation is viewed as a more viable option. The purpose of the current study was to examine how mood would affect cooperation and willingness to give up free access in favor of a structural solution within a resource dilemma. Two hundred fifteen undergraduate students were randomly assigned to the 4 (Mood: anger, sadness, happiness, control) X 2 (Use: Optimal Use versus Overuse) between participants design. Cooperation was measured within a 10-trial resource dilemma, and their attributions for the success or failure of the resource were assessed. Finally, they were given the opportunity to vote to play a second round of the game using the status quo or one of three structural solutions: Harvest Cap, Leader, Computer Monitoring System. Results were largely inconclusive. Although well-validated mood manipulations were employed, the manipulations were largely ineffective at producing the desired moods. Mood did not have the predicted effect on cooperation or willingness to adopt a structural solution. There was a main effect of use on cooperation, indicating that those participants who experienced a rapidly depleting resource cooperated more (consumed less) than when the resource was being optimally used. Measured mood (particularly sadness) predicted willingness to adopt a structural solution. Discussion focuses on why the mood manipulation was largely ineffective and possible reasons for the lack of support for the predictions. Future studies should use a mood manipulation that connects more strongly to the dilemma situation, and measure consequential changes in both processing and behavior.

"Examined whether people respond differently to people-induced scarcities and abundances than to nature-induced ones. In a resource dilemma game, half of 72 high school students were confronted with a scarce remaining resource and the other half with an abundant one. Half of the Ss in each condition learned that scarcity and abundance could be attributed to the members of their own group, while the other half believed that these circumstances were due to the environment. Ss harvested more from the resource in abundance than in scarcity conditions. The difference in harvest size between scarcity and abundance conditions was greater in the environment condition than in the group condition. Results are contrasted to predictions derived from a rational economic analysis, and a psychological model that accounts for the results is discussed.

"We investigated how another person’s emotions about resource allocation decisions influence observers’ resource allocations by influencing the emotions that observers anticipate feeling if they were to act in the same way. Participants were exposed to an exemplar who made a fair or unfair division in an economic game and expressed pride or regret about this decision. Participants then made their own resource allocation decisions. Exemplar regret about acting fairly decreased the incidence of fair behavior (Studies 1A and 1B). Likewise, exemplar regret about acting unfairly increased the incidence of fair behavior (Study 2). The effect of others’ emotions on observers’ behavior was mediated by the observers’ anticipated emotions. We discuss our findings in light of the view that social appraisal and anticipated emotions are important tools for social learning and may contribute to the formation and maintenance of social norms about greed and fairness.

"In two studies, we investigate the effects of group size (un)certainty and social value orientations in common resource dilemmas. By focusing on this largely unexplored type of environmental uncertainty, we show that, in contrast to the often replicated finding that resource size uncertainty leads to over-harvesting in common resource dilemmas, group size uncertainty is not necessarily detrimental to the collective interest. Furthermore, we argue and show that whereas under group size certainty people base their individual harvests on the equal division rule, under group size uncertainty they base their harvests on their own social value orientations: whereas under group size certainty both proselfs and pro-socials harvest about an equal share of the common resource, under uncertainty prosocials show self-restraint in order to further their group's outcomes.

"Previous research on the allocation of scarce resources shows that when people are assigned labels of leader or follower in their group, leaders allocate more of the scarce resources to themselves than followers do. In three laboratory studies, we examine the idea that how people are selected for the leader role (i.e. election or appointment) determines whether leaders take more or equal shares (relative to followers) from a common resource. In a first experiment, we show that participants were more accepting of norm violating behavior by an appointed versus elected leader. In a second experiment, we show that when participants were assigned to a leader or follower role, allocations of appointed leaders differed significantly from those of elected leaders and followers, whereas there was no difference between the two latter conditions. Moreover, elected leaders were shown to feel more social responsibility than both appointed leaders and followers. In a final experiment, we show that when participants were primed with the concept of social responsibility (relative to a neutral condition) no difference in allocations between appointed and elected leaders emerged.

"Begins by presenting 3 arguments for taking exogenous dynamics seriously in understanding human resource consumption behavior. These include: (1) actors learn not only from each other's actions but also from the responses of the resource; (2) exogenous dynamics influence time discounting (i.e., the tendency to perceive longer-term outcomes as less impactful than shorter-term ones), which in turn may influence actors' payoff; and (3) exogenous dynamics critically affect the influence of consumption rates and variability in consumption on the state of the resource.  Simple Markov models are proposed as random player models, providing a common metric and framework within which to compare the performance of human agents in maintaining a resource with exogenous dynamics. Arguments 1 and 3 are supported by illustrative empirical data obtained by simulation and from human Ss. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

The penalty and reward sanctions produced greater cooperation, and loss aversion heightened exploitation. Exp 2, with 74 undergraduates, extended the concept of frame and loss aversion to the structure of sanction systems. In Exp 2, framing influenced the level of contributions to the sanction, with greater contributions in the take sanction than in the given sanction.

They had the option of forming coalitions, which decreased the size of the resource pool, or practicing collective resource allocation, which increased it. Groups with a high-discount rate used resource distribution strategies (coalition formation) that resulted in lower individual as well as group outcomes.

"The current study examined people's willingness to change from free access to a resource to a structural solution (in which access is restricted) when they either were or were not provided information about the size of the resource. People who were either certain or uncertain about the resource were equally willing to implement a structural solution. Four novel structural solutions were employed in the current research and people's preferences for and the evaluation of these solutions were assessed. People most preferred the option in which a computer monitored the resource and allowed or restricted people's access to the resource. Furthermore, people judged this option as being the most attractive option. There was no effect on preferences for a structural solution option based on the certain or uncertain nature of the resource. The perceived fairness of the method of choosing a structural solution, that is, command-and-control versus public participation, was also under investigation. People found the participatory method fairer than the command-and-control method. Additionally, those certain about the resource found the participatory method fairer than those who were uncertain about the resource. Another goal of the current study was to investigate the bias toward optimism when the resource was uncertain or certain and its effects on consumption. People were less optimistic about the size of the resource when the resource was uncertain rather than certain and, overall, people were more optimistic about their own ability to manage the resource than others' abilities to manage it. This finding was independent of the certain or uncertain nature of the resource. Furthermore, having greater optimism in one's ability to manage the resource significantly predicted greater resource use. Finally, because the paradigm employed in this study defined environmental uncertainty as providing no information about the size of the resource, it was of interest to investigate resource consumption rates. Contrary to predictions and past research, people who were uncertain about the resource initially consumed less than those who were certain about the resource and significantly increased their consumption through time. These results can contribute to the social dilemmas literature as well as inform public policy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Discusses a class of social dilemma situations in which Ss are instructed that there is a certain amount of money, x, that can be made available to them collectively and all they have to do is to request individually and anonymously how much money they want. If the total amount requested collectively by the group members does not exceed x, each member gets what he/she requested. Otherwise, no one receives anything. The amount x is a realization of a random variable drawn from a probability distribution whose parameters are common knowledge; the number of members in the group is known. The amount of money each group member requested was examined.

The solution is experimentally testable, whether or not the other requests are known. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Administered a resource management task to 86 US and 97 Dutch undergraduates. Ss were divided into groups of 6 and instructed to harvest points from a regenerating resource pool. Their objective was to maximize individual harvests while maintaining the resource pool. The factorial design crossed 3 levels of resource use (overuse, underuse, and optimal use) with 2 levels of variance of others' purported harvests (low and high). Both variables were manipulated through false feedback to Ss regarding the pool size and the other Ss' harvests. The primary dependent measures were Ss' individual harvests and whether Ss voted for or against elimination of free access to the resource in favor of electing a leader who would make harvest decisions for the group. Results indicate that harvest size increased over time only in the under- and optimal-use conditions. As predicted, overuse Ss voted to give up free access to the resource and to elect a leader more frequently than Ss in the other conditions.

"In this article, natural resource management is conceptualized as a social dilemma, a conflict between the short-term self-interest of users and the long-term collective interest of the user community. A self-interest vs community perspective is offered to explain individuals' decision making in resource dilemmas. The self-interest model assumes that users seek to maximize their personal benefits regardless of the collective implications. To foster sustainable use, it is necessary to restrict people's access to the resource either through controlling the resource centrally (centralization) or by creating a system of individual access (individualization). The alternative community model suggests that communities can foster self-restraint among users provided that they fell attached to their community. These 2 perspectives and their implications for natural resource management are systematically compared using findings from research on water conservation.

"Investigated the effects of inequities in access to and use of shared resources on harvest decisions and preferences for structural change in resource dilemmas. 70 undergraduates, in groups of approximately 6, harvested resource units from a common resource pool over 10 trials. Following the harvest trials, Ss were asked to vote on how to conduct the session. The variables were (a) access to the resource pool, (b) perceived resource use, and (c) perceived inequity in other group members' harvests. It was hypothesized that high-variance Ss, when placed in a situation where harvest inequities could be attributed to access differences, would demonstrate a stronger preference for equality-restoring decision structures than would low-variance Ss. Results offer little support for this prediction; the variance manipulation had the predicted effect only among high-access Ss in the overuse condition. The access and use variables had independent effects on preferences for structural change.

identity for Japanese. In the ChinaTaiwan experiment, Taiwanese but not

"{Behaviour on even simple experimental games shows considerable
individual differences, but previous attempts to link these preferences

three limitations of earlier studies, namely: (1) uncertainties

where more than one psychological motive can lead to a particular
choice. Sixty-seven participants completed 12 distinct real-money games

expectations about other players' choices. Personality was measured
using the full NEO-PI-R. Choices were highly stable across time (r =
.84). Moreover, choices on the 12 games and 6 expectations reflected a
single underlying dimension of ``prosocial orientation{''}, measuring
concern for the payoffs received by other players. Scores on the
prosocial orientation dimension were related to personality, with
openness, (low) neuroticism, and (low) extraversion retained as

"{Conflicts of interest between the community and its members are at the
core of human social dilemmas. If observed selfishness has future costs,
individuals may hide selfish acts but display altruistic ones, and peers
aim at identifying the most selfish persons to avoid them as future
social partners. An interaction involving hiding and seeking information
may be inevitable. We staged an experimental social-dilemma game in
which actors could pay to conceal information about their contribution,
giving, and punishing decisions from an observer who selects her future
social partners from the actors. The observer could pay to conceal her
observation of the actors. We found sophisticated dynamic strategies on
either side. Actors hide their severe punishment and low contributions
but display high contributions. Observers select high contributors as
social partners; remarkably, punishment behavior seems irrelevant for
qualifying as a social partner. That actors nonetheless pay to conceal
their severe punishment adds a further puzzle to the role of punishment
in human social behavior. Competition between hiding and seeking
information about social behavior may be even more relevant and
elaborate in the real world but usually is hidden from our eyes.}"
"{The present research tested 2 competing models specifying how 2 traits

dilemma (Study 2), a continuous give-some dilemma (Study 3), and a
2-alternative maximizing difference game (Study 4). Among proselfs or

"{It has been suggested that the expectation of repeated (versus single)
interaction might promote cooperation in social dilemmas. One key
question is whether the anticipation of repeated interaction may promote
cooperation in those with prosocial orientations, with individualistic
orientations, or both. We advance the argument that repeated interaction
may be perceived in terms of opportunities for punishing noncooperation
and rewarding cooperation (reciprocity), and that such
``contingencies{''} should have a relatively greater impact on
individualists' motivations to cooperate. Consistent with hypotheses, we
found evidence for the idea that the mere anticipation of repeated

those who are more prone to pursue prosocial goals.}"
"{Although it is commonly believed that women are kinder and more
cooperative than men, there is conflicting evidence for this assertion.
Current theories of sex differences in social behavior suggest that it
may be useful to examine in what situations men and women are likely to
differ in cooperation. Here, we derive predictions from both
sociocultural and evolutionary perspectives on context-specific sex
differences in cooperation, and we conduct a unique meta-analytic study
of 272 effect sizes sampled across 50 years of research on social
dilemmas to examine several potential moderators. The overall average
effect size is not statistically different from zero (d = -0.05),
suggesting that men and women do not differ in their overall amounts of
cooperation. However, the association between sex and cooperation is
moderated by several key features of the social context: Male male
interactions are more cooperative than female female interactions (d =
0.16), yet women cooperate more than men in mixed-sex interactions (d =
-0.22). In repeated interactions, men are more cooperative than women.
Women were more cooperative than men in larger groups and in more recent
studies, but these differences disappeared after statistically
controlling for several study characteristics. We discuss these results
in the context of both sociocultural and evolutionary theories of sex
differences, stress the need for an integrated biosocial approach, and
outline directions for future research.}"
"{We investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin (OXT) on trust and
cooperation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder marked
by interpersonal instability and difficulties with cooperation. Although
studies in healthy adults show that intranasal OXT increases trust,
individuals with BPD may show an altered response to exogenous OXT
because the effects of OXT on trust and pro-social behavior may vary
depending on the relationship representations and expectations people
possess and/or altered OXT system functioning in BPD. BPD and control
participants received intranasal OXT and played a social dilemma game
with a partner. Results showed that OXT produced divergent effects in
BPD participants, decreasing trust and the likelihood of cooperative
responses. Additional analyses focusing on individual differences in
attachment anxiety and avoidance across BPD and control participants
indicate that these divergent effects were driven by the anxiously
attached, rejection-sensitive participants. These data suggest that OXT
does not uniformly facilitate trust and pro-social behavior in humans;
indeed, OXT may impede trust and pro-social behavior depending on
chronic interpersonal insecurities, and/or possible neurochemical
differences in the OXT system. Although popularly dubbed the `hormone of
love', these data suggest a more circumspect answer to the question of
who will benefit from OXT.}"

"{The present research examined the interplay of individual differences in
self-regulatory mechanisms as outlined in regulatory focus theory

vigilant prevention focus, the more likely they are to act cooperatively

subtle cue of being watched renders reputational concerns salient. In
contrast, when no such cue is provided individuals' habitual vigilant

"{We describe and empirically investigate a hybrid social dilemma that
merges give-some and take-some dilemmas by allowing individuals to
choose to either give or to take resources from a shared resource pool.
Study 1 finds that (a) group size increases the inequality among group
members and the likelihood of creating the public good, while reducing
the amount of wasted resources; (b) larger bonuses increase provision
rates; and (c) asymmetry in the wealth distribution of the group members
induces higher levels of inequality of the final outcomes. Following the
logic of appropriateness, players with high (low) endowments were more
likely to give toward (take from) the shared resource. Study 2 finds
that the tendency of the players with high (low) endowments to give
(take) is amplified as the difference between endowment levels
increased, and the players' behavior is correlated with, and predictable
from, independent judgments of what is perceived as appropriate. (C)

"{Online labor markets have great potential as platforms for conducting
experiments. They provide immediate access to a large and diverse
subject pool, and allow researchers to control the experimental context.
Online experiments, we show, can be just as valid-both internally and
externally-as laboratory and field experiments, while often requiring
far less money and time to design and conduct. To demonstrate their
value, we use an online labor market to replicate three classic
experiments. The first finds quantitative agreement between levels of
cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma played online and in the physical
laboratory. The second shows-consistent with behavior in the traditional
laboratory-that online subjects respond to priming by altering their
choices. The third demonstrates that when an identical decision is
framed differently, individuals reverse their choice, thus replicating a
famed Tversky-Kahneman result. Then we conduct a field experiment
showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally,
we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to
cope with the unique threats to validity in an online setting, and
examining the conceptual issues surrounding the external validity of
online results. We conclude by presenting our views on the potential
role that online experiments can play within the social sciences, and
then recommend software development priorities and best practices.}"
"{Does emotional intelligence promote behavior that strictly benefits the
greater good, or can it also advance interpersonal deviance? In the
investigation reported here, we tested the possibility that a core facet
of emotional intelligence-emotion-regulation knowledge-can promote both
prosocial and interpersonally deviant behavior. Drawing from research on
how the effective regulation of emotion promotes goal achievement, we
predicted that emotion-regulation knowledge would strengthen the effects
of other-oriented and self-oriented personality traits on prosocial
behavior and interpersonal deviance, respectively. Two studies supported
our predictions. Among individuals with higher emotion-regulation
knowledge, moral identity exhibited a stronger positive association with
prosocial behavior in a social dilemma (Study 1), and Machiavellianism
exhibited a stronger positive association with interpersonal deviance in
the workplace (Study 2). Thus, emotion-regulation knowledge has a
positive side and a dark side.}"
"{As previous research has demonstrated numerous times, humans show a
robust tendency for cooperation. However, part- or indeed all-of this
cooperativeness may be due to socially desirable responding. To address
this problem, we propose and apply a new approach for the unbiased
measurement of cooperativeness in social dilemma games. Specifically, we
employ an extension of the randomized-response technique (RRT). The RRT
protects the privacy of respondents by adding random noise to their
responses. It thus encourages more honest responding and thereby
provides less biased estimates of sensitive attributes. In a large-scale
study with 2043 respondents we maximized anonymity in a one-shot
prisoner's dilemma game through use of the RRT. Comparing the prevalence
rates for cooperation obtained via the RRT with those from direct
self-report showed that traditional direct questioning formats
overestimate cooperation rates, with a relative bias of 18\%. This
finding suggests that to a considerable extent, self-reported
cooperation is due to socially desirable responding, rather than actual
cooperativeness. However, our results also demonstrate that cooperation
remains substantial even under conditions of maximized anonymity.

"{Laboratory studies of choice and decision making among real monetary
rewards typically use smaller real rewards than those common in real
life. When laboratory rewards are large, they are almost always
hypothetical. In applying laboratory results meaningfully to real-life
situations, it is important to know the extent to which choices among
hypothetical rewards correspond to choices among real rewards and
whether variation of the magnitude of hypothetical rewards affects
behavior in meaningful ways. The present study compared real and
hypothetical monetary rewards in two experiments. In Experiment 1,
participants played a temporal discounting game that incorporates the
logic of a repeated prisoner's-dilemma (PD) game versus tit-for-tat;
choice of one alternative ({''}defection{''} in PD terminology) resulted
in a small-immediate reward; choice of the other alternative
({''}cooperation{''} in PD terminology) resulted in a larger reward
delayed until the following trial. The larger-delayed reward was greater
for half of the groups than for the other half. Rewards also differed in
type across groups: multiples of real nickels, hypothetical nickels, or
hypothetical hundred-dollar bills. All groups significantly increased
choice of the larger delayed reward over the 40 trials of the
experiment. Over the last 10 trials, cooperation was significantly
higher when the difference between larger and smaller hypothetical
rewards was greater. Reward type (real or hypothetical) made no
significant difference in cooperation on most measures. In Experiment 2,
real and hypothetical rewards were compared in social discounting-the
decrease in value to the giver of a reward as social distance increases
to the receiver of the reward. Social discount rates were well described
by a hyperbolic function. Discounting rates for real and hypothetical
rewards did not significantly differ. These results add to the evidence
that results of experiments with hypothetical rewards validly apply in
everyday life.}"
"{Culture affects the extent to which people focus on other people or on
the situation in drawing inferences. Building on recent research showing
that perceptions of others and situations can mediate prime-to-behavior
effects, we tested whether culture would modify both the mechanism and
the outcome of primed constructs on behavior. Easterners and Westerners
were primed with competitiveness or cooperativeness before playing a
social dilemma game with an ambiguously or unambiguously competitive
player. Results indicated that the primes had different effects on the
social dilemma decisions of Easterners and Westerners and that these
effects were due to the different consequences the primes had for
Easterners' and Westerners' perceptions of the other player and
construals of the situation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{The evolution of parochial altruism is not well understood. We study
this problem by considering a prisoner's dilemma game with four
strategies: altruists who cooperate with everyone; parochialists who
only cooperate with members of their own group; traitors who only
cooperate with outgroup individuals; and egoists who never cooperate. We
develop a model that allows for both assortment and conflict between
groups. Individuals discriminate between in- and outgroup members. While
assortment and conflict allow for the evolution of both indiscriminate
and parochial altruism, discriminate behavior creates an advantage for
parochialists over altruists, as the latter waste help on outgroup
members. We use computer simulations to study the multilevel selection
dynamics. The simulation model describes an absorbing Markov chain. We
examine the absorption probabilities of altruists and parochialists.
Three model versions are compared, with only assortment, with only group
conflict, and with both mechanisms. We find that parochialism is
selected for by group conflict as well as assortment. Discrimination
allows for cooperation inside groups to withstand regular interactions
with outgroup members. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{How effective are rewards (for cooperation) and punishment (for
noncooperation) as tools to promote cooperation in social dilemmas or
situations when immediate self-interest and longer term collective
interest conflict? What variables can promote the impact of these
incentives? Although such questions have been examined, social and
behavioral scientists provide different answers. To date, there is no
theoretical and/or quantitative review of rewards and punishments as
incentives for cooperation in social dilemmas. Using a novel
interdependence-theoretic framework, we propose that rewards and
punishments should both promote cooperation, and we identify 2
variables-cost of incentives and source of incentives-that are predicted
to magnify the effectiveness of these incentives in promoting
cooperation. A meta-analysis involving 187 effect sizes revealed that
rewards and punishments exhibited a statistically equivalent positive
effect on cooperation (d = 0.51 and 0.70, respectively). The
effectiveness of incentives was stronger when the incentives were costly
to administer, compared to free. Centralization of incentives did not
moderate the effect size. Punishments were also more effective during
iterated dilemmas when participants continued to interact in the same
group, compared to both (a) iterated dilemmas with reassignment to a new
group after each trial and (b) one-shot dilemmas. We also examine
several other potential moderators, such as iterations, partner
matching, group size, country, and participant payment. We discuss broad
conclusions, consider implications for theory, and suggest directions
for future research on rewards and punishment in social dilemmas.}"
"{This study compared psychological and behavioral responses in a
take-some social dilemma with those in a give-some situation and
suggested an explanation in terms of a dual process model. Participants
facing the take-some dilemma exhibited a higher level of cooperation
than those facing the give-some dilemma only in their first decision
trial, and this effect was independent of our experimental manipulation
of the information processing mode. Furthermore, once an experiential
mode was induced, participants spent less time and experienced less
conflict when making decisions in the take-some dilemma than in the
give-some situations. The findings indicate that in social dilemmas the
information processing mode has a stronger effect on psychological
responses than on behavioral responses.}"
"{Many situations of information exchange represent a social dilemma, in
which individual costs and benefits for contributing information are
contradictory to the group's costs and benefits. Recent studies have
shown that (a) people select their contributions according to the
benefit that these contributions provide to others, (b) the social value
orientation of individuals affects their willingness to contribute, and
(c) externally provided behavioral guidelines have an impact on
individual behavior. We conducted 2 experiments in which people were
able to actively manipulate the value that their information had for
others (in Study 1, this value had no influence on their own costs; in
Study 2, a higher value to others implied higher contribution costs for
the individual contributor). Both studies revealed that people avoided
contributing such information that would have provided others with a
higher benefit than the benefit the individual contributors themselves
received through this information. Even prosocials-who generally acted
more cooperatively than proselfs-behaved like that. In both studies,
behavioral guidelines had an impact on the number of contributions,
independent of the value of information.}"
"{This research examined the question of whether the psychology of social
identity can motivate cooperation in the context of a global collective.
Our data came from a multinational study of choice behavior in a
multilevel public-goods dilemma conducted among samples drawn from the
general populations of the United States, Italy, Russia, Argentina,
South Africa, and Iran. Results demonstrate that an inclusive social
identification with the world community is a meaningful psychological
construct that plays a role in motivating cooperation that transcends
parochial interests. Self-reported identification with the world as a
whole predicts behavioral contributions to a global public good beyond
what is predicted from expectations about what other people are likely
to contribute. Furthermore, global social identification is conceptually
distinct from general attitudes about global issues, and has unique
effects on cooperative behavior.}"
"{We study experimentally how males and females differ in the way
same-gender peers observing their action affects their social behavior.
In our experiment, people play a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a partisan
audience watching the choice. Two groups participated in each session;
these groups could be both all-male, both all-female, or one all-male
and one all-female. Groups were separated into two rooms. Each person in
the group played the game once with an audience of the same group and
once with audience of the other group. Behavior is significantly
affected by the interaction of gender and place: males cooperate
substantially less often when observed by their peer group, while
females cooperate substantially more often. We discuss a possible
explanation for this pattern: Males and females wish to signal their
in-group peers, but males wish to signal their formidability and females
wish to signal their cooperativeness. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

"{We investigate how implicit influences of Christian religious
representations affect prosociality. We examine the direct impact of
religion as an independent variable on prosocial behavior. We do so by
priming participants with religious words in a scrambled sentence task
before they make a dictator game and a prisoner's dilemma game decision.
Priming religious words significantly increased prosocial behavior in
both games: participants in the treatment group were more generous and
cooperative than participants in the control group. The priming effect
was present regardless of participants' self-reported religiosity.
Self-reported religiosity was not correlated with generosity or
cooperation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{For cooperation to evolve via direct reciprocity, individuals must track
their partners' behavior to avoid exploitation. With increasing size of
the interaction group, however, memory becomes error prone. To decrease
memory effort, people could categorize partners into types,
distinguishing cooperators and cheaters. We explored two ways in which
people might preferentially track one partner type: remember cheaters or
remember the rare type in the population. We assigned participants to
one of three interaction groups which differed in the proportion of
computer partners' types (defectors rare, equal proportion, or
cooperators rare). We extended research on both hypotheses in two ways.
First, participants experienced their partners repeatedly by interacting
in Prisoner's Dilemma games. Second, we tested categorization of
partners as cooperators or defectors in memory tests after a short and
long retention interval (10 min and 1 week). Participants remembered
rare partner types better than they remembered common ones at both
retention intervals. We propose that the flexibility of responding to
the environment suggests an ecologically rational memory strategy in
social interactions.}"
"{This study examined whether blushing after a sociomoral transgression
remediates trustworthiness in an interdependent context. Participants (N
= 196) played a computerized prisoner's dilemma game with a virtual
opponent who defected in the second round of the game. After the
defection, a photograph of the opponent was shown, displaying a blushing
or a nonblushing face. In a subsequent Trust Task, the blushing opponent
was entrusted with more money than the nonblushing opponent. In further
support of the alleged remedial properties of the blush, participants
also indicated that they trusted the blushing opponent more, expected a
lower probability that she would defect again, and judged the blushing
opponent more positively.}"
"{Data from self-report and observational studies make it clear that
problematic social anxiety confers interpersonal constraint that may
contribute to the interpersonal dysfunction reported by individuals with
social anxiety disorder. Direct observation of interpersonal behavior in
established relationships is rare and difficult to obtain for practical
reasons. We tested a flexible iterated prisoner's dilemma computer task
to examine whether it might capture interpersonal constraint related to
social anxiety. Our first study suggested that, at least for men, the
task directly captures social anxiety's constraint on responses to
friendly giving. Our second study more strongly supported the assertion
that the task directly assesses interpersonal constraint. The data
support a model in which social anxiety directly confers trait-like
tendencies toward interpersonal constraint and indirectly constrains
behavior in specific interactions. These studies provide further
evidence that constrained responses to positive social behaviors are
characteristic of people with problematic social anxiety and may be
particularly important to dysfunctions in the close relationships of
these individuals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{If psychopathy is the absence of the cooperative dispositions present in
normally-developing individuals, then individuals with higher levels of
psychopathic personality traits should exhibit lower levels of
cooperation in experimental games. The present study investigated
whether Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) scores were negatively
correlated with cooperation in one-shot prisoner's dilemmas and
bargaining games. The results show that specific PPI subscales
(especially Machiavellian Egocentricity) were negatively associated with
cooperation, and have diverse effects on bargaining. These results
suggest that neither cooperation nor psychopathy are `monomorphic', and
that future research should identify how different aspects of
psychopathic personality influence distinct types of social interaction.

"{Behavior in the local commons is usually embedded within a context of
incentives, regulations and social norms for the group of resource
users. Standard environmental economics has tended mostly to focus on
the material incentives and regulations that transform the relative
material costs and benefits of various/specific/certain actions.
However, there exist behavioral aspects and social norms that affect how
individuals value material and non-material incentives, and thus
determine their decision to either cooperate or over-extract resources
from a common-pool. This paper discusses the importance of social norms
in shaping behavior in the commons through the lens of experiments-in
particular, experiments conducted in the field with exactly those people
who usually face these social dilemmas in their daily lives. Using a
large sample of experimental sessions inclusive of around one thousand
people, both villagers and students, I test some hypotheses about
behavior in the commons, wherein regulations and social norms constrain
people's choices. The results suggest that people evaluate several
components of intrinsic and material motivations in deciding whether or
not to cooperate. While responding in the expected direction to an
imperfectly monitored fine for over extraction, the valuation of the
private net cost of violating the regulation is not a sufficient
explanation for participants' changes in behavior in the experiments.
Even when violations have zero cost, people may react positively to an
external regulator who issues a normative statement about a rule aimed
at solving a particular social dilemma.}"
"{Reciprocity is apparently uncommon in animal societies because it
requires, to evolve, specialized cognitive abilities that most species
would not possess. In particular, memory would be important because
cooperation can emerge and be maintained only if the same opponents
interact repeatedly and adjust their decisions to their opponent's
previous move. To investigate how these constraints influence
reciprocity, we first conducted a preliminary foraging experiment with
zebra finches (Taeniapygia guttata) to insure that corticosterone
elevations impaired the birds' event memory capabilities. Then, we
performed a reciprocity experiment with established pairs that were
tested in a two-choice apparatus under two different conditions: once
with an empty implant and once with an implant of corticosterone. We
found that the birds were capable of sustained cooperation in the
Prisoner's Dilemma treatment but only when they had an empty implant.
Thus, our results support the hypothesis that limitations in event
memory constraint the frequency of reciprocity and hence would make this
form of cooperation difficult for non-human animals. In addition, as
levels of stress hormones can differ greatly among individuals, our
findings might also contribute explaining individual variation in the
propensity to cooperate.}"
"{The Maine lobster industry is experiencing record high catches because,
in all probability, of an effective management program. One of the most
important conservation measures is the V-notch program that allows
fishermen to conserve proven breeding females by notching the tails of
egg-bearing lobsters. Such marked lobsters may never be taken. Although
thousands of lobster fishermen participate, it is a voluntary practice.
The genesis of this practice is not easily explained, because V-notching
poses a prisoner's dilemma problem that gives fishermen an incentive to
avoid the practice. The most common explanations for ways to overcome
prisoner's dilemma problems will not work in the case of the V-notch. An
unusual combination of factors explains the V-notch program: (1) a
strong belief among those in the industry that the V-notch is effective
in conserving the lobster stock; (2) a low discount rate because the
long-term gains from V-notching are higher than the one-time gain from
defection; (3) a gain in reputation for those who V-notch. At the start
of the 20th century, fishermen did not V-notch; by the end of the
century, V-notching was common. We explain the change in strategies
using a three-parameter evolutionary model that emphasizes the
importance of culture change.}"
"{Two experiments using an iterated prisoner's dilemma game examined under
which conditions participants' cooperation rates would either change due
to monetary value changes (e.g., 3 cents to 3 dollars) or not change due
to numeric value changes (e.g., 3 dollars to 300 cents). A total of 102
university students played the game against a computer that employed one
of four strategies across blocks. Results showed high rates of
cooperation when participants played against a tit-for-tat strategy and
low rates of cooperation against a random strategy. There was no change
in cooperation rates due to changes in numeric value alone and a
decrease in cooperation rates when large monetary values were at stake.
Cooperation rates were higher and cooperation responses slower at
earlier stages of the game. I argue that people's ability to strategize
plays a key role in the changing rates and speed of cooperative
behaviour in the prisoner's dilemma.}"

games has focused primarily on social emotions such as anger and guilt.
In this article, we provide a test for behavioural differences between
two prototypical decision-related negative emotionsregret and
disappointmentin one-shot social dilemma games. Three experiments with
two different emotion-induction procedures (autobiographical recall and
imagined scenarios) and two different games (the ultimatum game and the

results extend previous findings concerning differences between regret

"{We compared neural and behavioral responses to feedback received during
interpersonal interactions within the Prisoner's Dilemma game between
adolescents with anxiety disorders (n = 12) and healthy peers (n = 17).
Groups differed significantly in neural activation in the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus,
insula, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Anxious adolescents were
also more likely than controls to cooperate after co-player betrayal.
Our findings provide evidence that social behavior and related neural
activity differs between anxious and healthy adolescents. These findings
constitute a step toward elucidating neural correlates of social
impairment in anxious youths.}"
"{Consciousness and self-awareness, juxtaposed by the ability to
self-deceive, are legacies of our evolutionary heritage. As a purposive
outgrowth of modularity, self-deception may serve to isolate threatening
thoughts from consciousness and facilitate cooperation. The primary goal
of the present investigation was to determine if individuals with
depression exhibit both low levels of self-deception and cooperation.
Relationships between the tendency to self-deceive and the conscious
attributions typical of depression or promoting cooperation were also
examined. Eighty undergraduate participants completed measures of
self-deception, impression management, depression, and attributional
styles. Cooperation was assessed by responses to social dilemmas based
on the prisoner's dilemma game. Results indicated that, as expected,
high self-deceivers cooperated more and exhibited lower levels of
depression than low self-deceivers. Self-deception scores were
significantly associated with several attributional styles but
independently predicted depressive symptomology. That individuals with
depression displayed both reduced levels of self-deception and
cooperation is discussed in light of several models of the evolutionary
significance of depression, especially E. H. Hagen's bargaining model of
depression {[}The functions of postpartum depression. Evolution and

"{Theoretical studies of cooperative behavior have focused on decision
strategies that depend on a partner's last choices. The findings from
this work assume that players accurately remember past actions. The kind
of memory that these strategies employ, however, does not reflect what
we know about memory. Here, we show that human memory may not meet the
requirements needed to use these strategies. When asked to recall the
previous behavior of simulated partners in a cooperative memory task,
participants performed poorly, making errors in 10-24\% of the trials.
Participants made more errors when required to track more partners. We
conducted agent-based simulations to evaluate how well cooperative
strategies cope with error. These simulations suggest that, even with
few errors, cooperation could not be maintained at the error rates
demonstrated by our participants. Our results indicate that the
strategies typically used in the study of cooperation likely do not
reflect the underlying cognitive capacities used by humans and other
animals in social interactions. By including unrealistic assumptions
about cognition, theoretical models may have overestimated the
robustness of the existing cooperative strategies. To remedy this,
future models should incorporate what we know about cognition.}"
"{Two experimental studies were used to investigate how interacting with
aggressive virtual characters in video games affects trust and
cooperation of players. Study 1 demonstrates that experiencing virtual
aggression from a victim's perspective can impair players' investments
in a subsequent common goods dilemma situation. This effect is mediated
by reduced expectations of trust in the cooperativeness of interaction
partners. In Study 2 the same effect was replicated by using a different
cooperation task and by investigating the moderating role of justice
sensitivity from a victim's perspective as a dispositional factor.
Participants transferred less money to an unknown partner in a trust
game after exposure to aggressive nonplayer characters in a video game.
This effect was stronger for people high in victim sensitivity. Results
of both studies can be interpreted in line with the sensitivity to mean
intentions model and add to the body of research on violent media
effects.}"
"{For the purpose of managing a common pool resource (CPR), it may be
crucial to know what kind of information is important to the actors

increased in importance with decreasing resource availability, (2) this
increase was more pronounced in the presence of high ecological
uncertainty, and (3) individuals attributing the availability of the
resource to the group attached more importance to information on others'
behavior. These findings were reflected by the results on consumption
behavior, as (1) the average consumption decreased with decreasing
resource availability, (2) it decreased more pronounced in the presence
of high ecological uncertainty, and (3) individuals attributing the
availability of the resource to the group were more inclined to follow
the group's consumption than individuals attributing to the resource.}"

"{Understanding the neural mechanisms responsible for human social
interactions is difficult, since the brain activities of two or more
individuals have to be examined simultaneously and correlated with the
observed social patterns. We introduce the concept of hyper-brain
network, a connectivity pattern representing at once the information
flow among the cortical regions of a single brain as well as the
relations among the areas of two distinct brains. Graph analysis of
hyper-brain networks constructed from the EEG scanning of 26 couples of
individuals playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma reveals the
possibility to predict non-cooperative interactions during the
decision-making phase. The hyper-brain networks of two-defector couples
have significantly less inter-brain links and overall higher
modularity-i.e., the tendency to form two separate subgraphs-than
couples playing cooperative or tit-for-tat strategies. The decision to
defect can be ``read'' in advance by evaluating the changes of
connectivity pattern in the hyper-brain network.}"
"{Two experiments utilized a new experimental paradigm-the Intergroup
Prisoner's Dilemma-Maximizing Difference (IPD-MD) game-to study how
relative deprivation at the group level affects intergroup competition.
The IPD-MD game enables group members to make a costly contribution to
either a within-group pool that benefits fellow ingroup members, or a
between-group pool, which, in addition, harms outgroup members. We found
that when group members were put in a disadvantaged position, either by
previous actions of the outgroup (Experiment 1) or by random misfortune
(Experiment 2), they contributed substantially more to the competitive
between-group pool. This destructive behavior both minimized inequality
between the groups and reduced collective efficiency. Our results
underscore the conditions that lead group members to care about relative
(rather than absolute) group outcomes and highlight the need to
differentiate between the motivation to get ahead and the motivation not
to fall behind: the latter, it appears, is what motivates individual
participation in destructive intergroup competition.}"
"{In intergroup conflict, individual cooperation may be directed at
strengthening the ingroup, thus undermining the effectiveness and
sustainability of the competing outgroup. Reversely, cooperation
directed towards the competing outgroup indirectly undermines the
viability of the ingroup and is often seen by ingroup members as
disloyal, non-cooperative behavior. Using the Intergroup Prisoner's
Dilemma-Maximizing Differences Game to model intergroup conflict, the
experiment reported here shows that compared to individuals with a
chronic pro-self orientation, those with a chronic pro-social
orientation display stronger ingroup trust and ingroup love-they
self-sacrifice to benefit their ingroup-but not more or less outgroup
distrust and outgroup hate. Furthermore, in this situation pro-social
individuals were driven more by ingroup fairness considerations when
contributing to their ingroup. Path analyses suggest that effects of
social value orientation on ingroup love are mediated by ingroup trust
and not by fairness considerations. Implications for research on social
value orientations, and intergroup conflict and competition are
discussed.}"
"{Conflict pervades social life. To forgive others, people must control
their vengeful impulses. The efficiency by which the body uses glucose,
an indicator of self-control, might have direct implications for
interpersonal forgiveness. In four studies (N = 693), we tested the
hypothesis that a physiological marker of deficient glucose use (i.e.,
type 2 diabetic symptoms) relates to less forgiveness. Higher type 2
diabetic symptoms correlated negatively with a dispositional tendency to
forgive others (Study 1) and correlated positively with unforgiving
motivations toward hypothetical transgressors (Study 2) and actual
transgressors (Study 3). Diabetic symptoms correlated negatively with
cooperative behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (Study 4). These
findings provide the first evidence that forgiveness depends on how
efficiently the body uses glucose. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

"{This study investigates how an individual's social value orientation
(SVO) interacts with explicit cooperative incentives on one hand, and
intrinsic and extraneously induced trust on the other hand, to affect
cooperative behavior. In three experiments, subjects (n = 322) played a
one-shot prisoner's dilemma (PD; with weak cooperative incentives) and
an assurance game (AG; with strong cooperative incentives) in conditions
with or without trust signals. The authors found, as expected, that
cooperative behavior is strongly spurred by explicit incentives, but not
by trust, among people with a proself value orientation. Conversely,
trust is very important to enhance cooperative behavior of participants
with a prosocial value orientation, whereas explicit incentives are less
important compared to proselfs. The authors conclude that this study
reveals two fundamentally different logics of cooperative behavior: one
based on extrinsic incentives and the other on trust.}"
"{If self-interested behavior conflicts with the collective welfare, rules
of cooperation are often installed to prevent egoistic behavior. We
hypothesized that installing such rules may instigate personal moral
norms of cooperation, but that they fail in doing so when installed by a
leader who is self-interested rather than self-sacrificing. Three
studies confirmed this and also showed that, consequently, only
self-sacrificing leaders were able to install rules that increase
cooperation without the need for a perfectly operating monitoring
system.}"
"{Intra-group cooperation in a social dilemma is increased after a group
has discussed and reached a decision, especially if the dilemma is
easily understood ('demonstrable'). This paper examines how
demonstrability affects the decision of a group that consists entirely
of participants who are initially noncooperative. Thirty-eight 6-person
groups with unanimous prior preference for cooperation or
non-cooperation discussed a prisoner's dilemma before making a group
decision. When demonstrability was low groups reflected the prior
(either cooperative or non-cooperative) preferences of their members.
When demonstrability was high we found that groups showed no effect of
prior preference. Specifically, groups of prior non-cooperators made
more cooperative group decisions and subsequently their members remained
cooperative when asked to express preferences individually. The combined

"{Prior studies have shown that selfish behavior is reduced when
co-players have the opportunity to approve/disapprove a player's choice,
even if that has no consequences on the player's material payoff. Using
a prisoner's dilemma, we experimentally study the causes of this
phenomenon, which seems crucial to understand compliance with social
norms. Our data is consistent with a model based on the assumption that
people feel badly if they expect to be disapproved by others.
Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence in line with the following
assumptions: (i) people become more aware about the other's opinion if
feedback is available, and (ii) even if the feedback is ex post and has
no effect on their ex ante expectations about disapproval, people prefer
not to receive negative feedback. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

participate in the game or not can affect contribution levels over time.
The analysis of two voluntary-participation treatments supports a
noticeable effect of an attractive exit option on contribution levels.
We conclude that voluntary participation can induce a recovery of
cooperation levels when the payoff yielded by the exit option is high
enough, so that the usually observed decay of average contribution

"{It is widely acknowledged that trust greatly affects work group
functioning. Whereas trust may facilitate cooperation, distrust may
impede it. Insight into when distrusters may be prompted to cooperate
may therefore be of importance. Empirical studies point to several
moderators of the effect of trust on cooperation. Unfortunately, these
studies largely ignored the potential role of group member affect. Our
study shows that group members' affective displays (particularly the
activation level of the displays) have a substantial impact on the
relationship between trust and cooperation. First, a scenario experiment
(n=80) revealed that low trusting individuals were more willing to
cooperate when confronted with group members who display high (versus
low) activation affective states, whereas for more high trusting
individuals cooperation was not contingent on other group members'
affective displays. Second, a laboratory experiment (n=78), employing a
social dilemma paradigm, replicated these findings and indicated that
this effect is explained by the extent to which others are expected to
cooperate. The discussion focuses on theoretical implications and
managerial ramifications. Our study testifies to the significant role
that affect may play in keeping up cooperation in organizations and work
groups when trust is withering.}"
"{Individuals' actions and their stated beliefs affect how others perceive
them. In a prisoner's dilemma, a defector who expects others to
cooperate is perceived as less moral than a defector who expects others
to defect; a cooperator who expects others to defect is perceived as
less competent than a cooperator who expects others to cooperate
(Experiment 1). This pattern suggests that in a context of
interdependence, a stated expectation that the behavior of others will
resemble one's own may protect one's social reputation. When outcomes
are not interdependent, expectations do not moderate the effects of
behavior on reputation (Experiment 2). In such a context, inductive
reasoning is sufficient to explain social projection. Both types of
results are replicated in a modified N-person social dilemma (Experiment
3), further validating the inductive-reasoning hypothesis. (C) 2010

"{Recent research has analyzed how individual characteristics, like the
exposure to different hormones and symmetry, affect decision-making and
strategic behaviour. The present article investigates the effect of
symmetry, of exposure to testosterone (T) in utero and during puberty
and of current T on cooperation in a Prisoners' Dilemma Game (PDG). T is
a hormone with well known effect on males' behaviour, and that promotes
activities that seek to increase reproductive success. Fluctuating
Asymmetry (FA) reflects the ability of the organism to maintain a stable
development and it is usually employed as a variable reflecting genetic
quality (low FA values are thought to signal higher genetic quality).
Our results show that subjects with intermediate levels of second to
fourth digit ratio (a proxy of exposure to Tin utero) and with high FA
cooperate more often in the PDG. We also observe that the latter effect
is due to the fact that FA has an impact on subjects' expectations about
the behaviour of their counterpart in the game. These results reinforce
the described link between markers related to genetic quality and
cooperative behaviour. This possible linkage of individual condition and
pro-social behaviour in humans clearly merits further attention. (C)

"{Previous research has suggested that the spontaneous display of positive
emotion may be a reliable signal of cooperative tendency in humans.
Consistent with this proposition, several studies have found that
self-reported cooperators indeed display higher levels of positive
emotions than non-cooperators. In this study, we defined cooperators and
non-cooperators in terms of their behavior as the proposer in an
ultimatum game, and video-taped their facial expressions as they faced
unfair offers as a responder. A detailed analysis of the facial
expressions displayed by participants revealed that cooperators
displayed greater amounts of emotional expressions, not limited to
positive emotional expression, when responding to unfair offers in the
ultimatum game. These results suggest that cooperators may be more
emotionally expressive than non-cooperators. We speculate that emotional
expressivity can be a more reliable signal of cooperativeness than the
display of positive emotion alone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

"{To test the hypothesis that sensitivity to monitoring drives people to
act altruistically toward members of their own community, two
experiments investigated whether an eye-like painting promotes altruism

(a recipient) who was from the minimal in-group or out-group.
Participants knew whether their recipient was an in-group member or an
out-group member, but were informed that their recipient did not know
the group membership of the dictator. In-group favoritism occurred only
when participants were facing a computer desktop which displayed a
painting of eyes, but did not occur in the absence of eyes. These
findings demonstrate that the eye painting displayed on the
participant's computer screen worked as a cue for monitoring and thus
enhanced the participant's altruistic behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"{The neuropeptide Oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in many aspects of
mammalian social behavior. This study investigates how OT interacts with
two well-studied determinants of cooperative behavior: incentives and
social information. Participants received OT or a placebo and played two
economic games: a Coordination Game (with strong incentives to
cooperate) and a Prisoner's Dilemma (with weak cooperative incentives).
OT enhanced cooperation only when social information was present, and
this effect was significantly more pronounced in the Coordination Game.
When social information was lacking, OT surprisingly decreased
cooperation. Consistent with the well-established role of OT in
trust-building and in social cognition, social information appears to be
crucial for OT to boost cooperative expectations in an interdependent
social interaction that provides incentives to cooperate. When these
cues are absent, OT appears to instead elicit a risk-averse strategy.

"{Background: Game theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game in
particular, which captures the paradox of cooperative interactions that
lead to benefits but entail costs to the interacting individuals, have
constituted a powerful tool in the study of the mechanisms of
reciprocity. However, in non-human animals most tests of reciprocity in
PD games have resulted in sustained defection strategies. As a
consequence, it has been suggested that under such stringent conditions
as the PD game humans alone have evolved the necessary cognitive
abilities to engage in reciprocity, namely, numerical discrimination,
memory and control of temporal discounting.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We use an iterated PD game to test rats
(Rattus norvegicus) for the presence of such cognitive abilities by
manipulating the strategy of the opponent, Tit-for-Tat and
Pseudo-Random, or the relative size of the temptation to defect. We
found that rats shape their behaviour according to the opponent's
strategy and the relative outcome resulting from cooperative or
defective moves. Finally, we show that the behaviour of rats is
contingent upon their motivational state (hungry versus sated).
Conclusions/Significance: Here we show that rats understand the payoff
matrix of the PD game and the strategy of the opponent. Importantly, our
findings reveal that rats possess the necessary cognitive capacities for
reciprocity-based cooperation to emerge in the context of a prisoner's
dilemma. Finally, the validation of the rat as a model to study
reciprocity-based cooperation during the PD game opens new avenues of
research in experimental neuroscience.}"
"{Evidence from two experiments indicates that task-related communication
promotes cooperation in mixed-motive situations by activating
interpersonal norms related to fairness and trust. In Experiment 1,
task-related communication increased cooperation between individuals in
a three-choice prisoner's dilemma game (PDG-Alt) but task-unrelated
communication did not. In Experiment 2, cooperation was increased both
by sending a task-related message to one's counterpart and receiving a
cooperative task-related message from one's counterpart. Mediation
analyses revealed that task-related communication increased cooperation
by activating fairness and trust norms (Experiments 1 and 2).
Specifically, whereas sending (relative to receiving) a task-related
message increased cooperation by activating fairness norms, receiving
(relative to sending) a task-related message increased cooperation by
activating trust norms (Experiment 2). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

"{This article investigates how group members respond to one another when
collective overuse occurs. The authors argue that interpersonal
reactions after overuse in a common-resource dilemma are largely
determined by the environmental characteristics of the social dilemma.
More specifically, under environmental certainty they expect people to
show more anger to group members than under uncertainty (Study 1).
Additionally, they expect stronger retributive reactions to high
harvesters than to moderate harvesters, and they expect this difference
to be larger under certainty than under uncertainty (Study 2 and 3).
Moreover, they predict that these effects are mediated by blaming. The
results of three experiments corroborate these predictions.}"
"{Experimental studies have shown that sanctions effectively deter free
riding within groups. However, the overuse of costly punishment may
actually harm overall welfare. A main reason for over-punishment is that
free-riders generate negative emotions that likely favor excessive
punishments. In this paper we ask whether the venting of one's emotions
in different ways can reduce the level of excessive punishment in a
standard VCM-with-punishment environment while preserving the norm
enforcement properties of punishment. We find that venting emotions
reduces (excessive) punishment, and under certain conditions the net
effect is an increase in final payoffs (i.e., welfare) to the group. (C)

compliance (contributing to the public good) is increasing in expected
punishment cost in both treatments. We also find the punishment severity

repeated treatment, we find that past punishment has a negative rather
than positive effect on compliance.}"
"The author examined a public goods (PG) dilemma with environmental uncertainty in a sequential protocol of play paradigm. Using a 5-person game, Experiment 1 examined provision point (PP) uncertainty and found that a certain PP requiring 3 contributors produced the PG more frequently than an uncertain PP of the same expectation that varied uniformly among 2, 3, and 4 contributors. Fixing PP at 3, Experiment 2 showed that PG provision rate was higher with a certain group size of 5 persons than an uncertain group size of the same expectation that varied uniformly among 4, 5. and 6 persons. Further analyses showed that a fear of wasting one's contribution and pessimistic beliefs of environmental uncertainty could have undermined contribution.

We propose a novel experimental design to distinguish two possible causes of crowding-in: reciprocity, the usual explanation, and conformity, a neglected alternative.

"We report an experiment on two treatments of an ultimatum minigame. In one treatment, responders' reactions are hidden to proposers. We observe high rejection rates reflecting responders' intrinsic resistance to unfairness. In the second treatment, proposers are informed, allowing for dynamic effects over eight rounds of play. The higher rejection rates can be attributed to responders' provision of a public good: Punishment creates a group reputation for being 'tough' and effectively 'educate' proposers. Since rejection rates with informed proposers drop to the level of the treatment with non-informed proposers, the hypothesis of responder's enjoyment of overt punishment is not supported.

"Tests the hypothesis that fair-minded offers in the Ultimatum, dictator, and public goods games will come from individuals who are most involved in the market and therefore concerned with their reputation for fairness. This is indeed consistent with the findings that are presented here for the Orma of East Africa. After highlighting aspects of pastoral-nomadic Orma life that mae be relevant to their behavior in experiments, the author discusses experimental methods. Results of the three games are consistent with general findings that shows fairness increasing with market integration. Something appears to trigger fair-mindedness in association with exposure to market institutions. Among those selling either their labor or their goods, there may be a higher premium placed upon reputation, and that one way of signaling a good reputation is to behave fair-mindedly. Eventually, this norm appears to be internalized, as is evident from its emergence in the anonymous, one-shot, economic experiments. This hypothesis warrants future replication in tightly controlled experiments with even more cross-cultural samples and also with cases similar to the Orma that offer a broad spectrum of variation in market integration within one society, thus helping to control for a vast array of potential confounds.

"This chapter attempts to expand the cross-cultural literature on economic games by focusing on the game behavior of the Tsimane', a group of Bolivian forager-horticulturalists. One salient feature that has been proposed as a possible explanation for cross-cultural differences in game behavior is the degree of market exposure and acculturation (Henrich 2000; Henrich et al., see record [rid]2005-01445-002[/rid]). This study therefore attempts to answer two questions: (1) Does Tsimane' game behavior differ from the standard results found among westernized, market-oriented, and industrialized populations? (2) Does differential exposure to competitive markets and an acculturated environment affect norms of fairness and game behavior across Tsimane' villages, or does a common Tsimane' identity and culture overshadow any differences due to acculturation? Offers in the Ultimatum Game tend to be lower than those found among western populations and higher than those reported for the Machiguenga, while contributions in the Public Goods Game tend to be higher than those reported for the Machiguenga, but within the range found among western populations. There is also a high level of variation in Ultimatum Game offers and Public Goods Game contributions by Tsimane' in comparison to standard western results. There are few differences in Ultimatum Game or Public Goods Game behavior that can be attributed to market exposure or acculturation, and the few differences that exist do not support the notion that exposure to modern markets produces game behavior similar to that found in the west. The strongest predictor of both individual Ultimatum Game and Public Goods Game behavior is village membership. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We ask whether conformity, copying the most observed behavior in a population, affects free riding. Our model suggests that, if sufficiently frequent at the start of a public goods game, conformity will increase the growth rate of free riding. We confirm this prediction in an experiment by showing that free riding grows faster when players have the information necessary to conform. As a stricter test, we econometrically estimate the dynamic on which the model is based and find that, controlling for the payoff incentive to free ride, players react significantly to the number of free riders in their groups.

"A limited number of studies have examined the appointment of leaders as a structural solution to social dilemmas (Messick & Brewer, 1983). The majority of these studies examined appointment of an overall leader to manage individual resource consumption on behalf of the entire group, particularly after leaderless groups have proven unable to show restraint. In this research, more attention was given to the acceptability of appointing a leader as an overall intervention, and less to the factors influencing the leader's effectiveness. We are only beginning to gain insight into important determinants of leader behavior in intergroup settings--those in which there is more than one subunit, each with its own leader. The inspiration for the current research came from Foddy and Crettenden's (1994) investigation of subgroup leadership behavior in resource dilemmas, and the game theory research concerning the structure of intergroup conflict. The present research tests the prediction that increasing a leader's sense of accountability to the overall collective acts to constrain intergroup competition and conflict. Collective accountability promotes thinking about others and attempts to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, which should result in a relatively equal division of contested resources, and restraint in use of scarce resources. Accountability to one's more circumscribed membership group, however, should enhance relative gain or competition between subgroups. In the first study reported, we contrasted leaders who were responsible to no one, to a subgroup or to a superordinate group. In the second study, we compared leaders who were or were not accountable to subgroups, with nonleaders, who were also accountable (or not) for their decisions. This second study allowed us to test whether the presumed superiority of leaders in managing a resource would be undermined by subgroup accountability.

"Focused on behavioral reactions to unequal distributions of wealth in an experiment involving 87 medical students who could contribute to a public good in fictitious 4-person groups. Within each group, the endowments were distributed asymmetrically. In one condition, Ss were told that this asymmetry was in accordance with group members' time investments. In the other condition, Ss were told that all members' time investments were equal. Results indicated that group members seize the opportunity to redistribute wealth through their contributions to a public good provision. Redistribution of wealth was more extreme if the initial distribution of wealth was incongruent with the group members' inputs (in terms of effort) than if it was congruent with those inputs. Results are interpreted in terms of equity theory and status-value theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Ss (73 university students) were either in a high-interest position (receiving 33% of the public good) or in a low-interest position (receiving 17%). To investigate whether equity theory may provide an adequate explanation for the effect of the interest differentials, the justification of the interest differences was manipulated. These differences were either justified (JFD) by an asymmetry of inputs or not JFD (because of symmetry of inputs). Predictions on the basis of equity theory were confirmed. The Ss were more motivated to minimize differences in final outcomes when interest differentials were not JFD than in case of a JFD distribution. On a behavioral level, high-interest Ss contributed more than low-interest Ss when the interest distribution was not JFD, but no differences were found in the case of a JFD distribution.

Two experiments were conducted with 240 male undergraduates in 5-person and 8-person groups.

"The paper presents a simple theoretical framework to explain the influence of the possibility to make non-binding announcements on investment behavior in public goods settings. Our model builds on the idea that voluntary contributions to the supply of a public good might be motivated by some form of joy of giving. We show that the possibility to make non-binding announcements has a positive effect on cooperative behavior, especially if individual announcements and factual investments are communicated to the players after each round. We also show that this result holds true even though the players have an incentive to overstate their true degrees of cooperativeness. Altogether, our theoretical considerations point in the direction that revealing as much information on individual intentions and factual behavior as possible enhances cooperative behavior. These conclusions are broadly confirmed by the results of a series of classroom experiments we present. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Public good games provide an experimental environment for the study of social dilemmas. Typically, participants receive their endowments for the game from the experimenter.

"In public-good provision, privileged groups enjoy the advantage that some of their members find it optimal to supply a positive amount of the public good. However, the inherent asymmetric nature of these groups may make the enforcement of cooperative behavior through informal sanctioning harder to accomplish. In this article, the authors experimentally investigate public-good provision in normal and privileged groups with and without decentralized punishment. The authors find that compared to normal groups, privileged groups are relatively ineffective in using costly sanctions to increase everyone's contributions. Punishment is less targeted toward strong free riders, and they exhibit a weaker increase in contributions after being punished. Thus, the authors show that privileged groups are not as privileged as they initially seem. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

A second study revealed that participants use communicated guilt to draw inferences about both past and future contributions from all fellow group members.

"The present research examines whether the emotional display (i.e. anger vs. guilt) of another group member affects people's decision-making in a public good dilemma. In two experiments we investigated whether the expressed emotion is particularly informative when communicated by a group member who is highly instrumental in reaching the provision point. A first experiment demonstrated that participants were more, likely to exit the group when anger as opposed to guilt was communicated, but especially when the group member displaying the emotion was able to contribute many endowments to the public good. Expected justice (based on past inferences) in the group mediated this effect, suggesting that communicated anger signals more than guilt that the group will not set out to achieve fairness. In agreement with this, a second experiment showed that when it was not possible to exit the group, participants preferred to install a democratic leader more when a wealthy group member communicated anger as opposed to guilt. Additionally, this study provided experimental evidence that a communicated emotion is only used for subsequent decision-making when more explicit information (i.e. a promise to contribute) is absent.

"Recent studies report that economic inequality is associated with reduced government expenditures on social programs. Several prominent social scientists, including Putman (Putnam, R., 2000. Bowling Alone. Simon and Schuster, New York), attribute this to the detrimental 'psychosocial effects' of group heterogeneity on cooperation. We test the hypothesis that inequality within a group reduces individual contributions in a public goods experiment. Unlike previous examinations of inequality and public good provision, we introduce inequality by manipulating the levels and distributions of fixed payments given to subjects. When made salient through public information about each individual's standing within the group, inequality reduces contributions to the public good for all group members.

"Experiments on three two-person threshold public good provision games, namely, the simultaneous, sequential, and dictator games, are conducted to explore the motives behind giving. Players who move simultaneously are endowed with equal bargaining power, and players who move first are endowed with more bargaining power than players who move subsequently. Dictators are indubitably endowed with complete bargaining power. Since the differences between the bargaining powers of two players increase from the simultaneous to the sequential to the dictator game, comparisons among games allow us to trace whether the contribution behavior is motivated by fairness or is simply due to the strategic concern. The experimental evidence shows that the strategic concern explains the overall contribution behavior better than the motive of fairness. However, in the final round 26% of the dictators share the threshold evenly with their opponents, suggesting that some subjects do play fairly.

"This paper addresses the external validity of experiments investigating the characteristics of altruism in the voluntary provision of public goods. We conduct two related experiments that allow us to examine whether individuals who act more altruistically in the context-free environment are also more likely to act altruistically toward a naturally occurring public good. We find that laboratory behavior can be predictive of contributions toward naturally occurring goods, but not in a uniform way. In fact, parametric measures of altruism do a poor job of predicting which subjects are most likely to contribute to a naturally occurring public good.

"This thesis explores some theoretical and empirical issues in the voluntary contributions to public good. Chapter I contains a brief motivation and introduction. In chapters II and III, we analyze two non-cooperative methods for either enhancing or mitigating externality-causing activities. Chapter II deals with positive externality in the public good contribution context, and chapter III with negative externality in the pollution abatement context. Chapter IV contains an empirical analysis of charitable donations by the elderly. Chapter II models the so-called 'corporate challenge gift' used in real world fund-raising, and adopts the concept to voluntary contributions to public goods more generally. We model the process as a sequential game in public good contributions. One of the agents sets a quantity-contingent matching scheme to leverage higher contributions from the other players. Under the assumption that the preferences of agents are public information and the assumption that the scheme setter can commit to the matching plan, we show that the scheme brings efficient levels of total contributions to the public good. Chapter III applies some ideas from a joint work with Professor Robin Boadway and Professor Jean-Franois Tremblay on 'Commitment and Matching Contributions to Public Goods' to the issue of reducing negative externality-causing activity. In particular, it adapts both the Guttman-Danziger-Schnytzer type of rate-matching mechanism and the quantity-contingent matching method for public good contributions to the international pollution abatement problem. In a simple two-country model, we find that both matching schemes induce the countries to internalize the negative externality imposed on the other country. However, perhaps due to the lack of enough policy instruments, they cannot equate the marginal costs of abatement across the countries, leaving room for Pareto improvement. This further improvement can be achieved if the two countries also contribute to a conventional public good. Chapter IV is an empirical exercise on some positive externality-generating activities by the elderly. It attempts to document the charitable giving of money and time by people aged 60 or above in the 2003 PSID data for the United States and analyze the influences of some economic and demographic factors on these activities. Income, wealth, the subjective rating of health status, and years in school are found to have statistically significant impacts. Income and wealth appear to have distinct influences. The tax price of money donation also has a statistically significant effect on money donations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Empirical research on this problem has often been discouraging, and economic models suggest that solutions are unlikely or unstable. In contrast, the authors present a model and 4 studies that show that an unwaveringly consistent contributor can effectively catalyze cooperation in social dilemmas. The studies indicate that consistent contributors occur naturally, and their presence in a group causes others to contribute more and cooperate more often, with no apparent cost to the consistent contributor and often gain. These positive effects seem to result from a consistent contributor's impact on group members' cooperative inferences about group norms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The authors manipulated the candidate's reported self-sacrifices to enter the group and the source of this information.

"The existence of a beauty premium in the labor market and the male-female wage gap suggests that appearance can matter in the real world. We explore beauty and gender in a public goods experiment and find similar effects. We find a beauty premium, even though beautiful people contribute, on average, no more or less than others. The beauty premium, however, disappears when we provide information on individual contributions, and becomes a beauty penalty. Players seem to expect beautiful people to be more cooperative. Relative to these expectations, they appear more selfish, which in turn results in less cooperation by others. These appear to be clear examples of stereotyping. We also find a substantial benefit to being male, especially with information. This is primarily due to men being better 'leaders.' Men tend to make large contributions, and people follow their example and give more in later rounds. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"We investigated experimentally whether costly punishment to enforce socially beneficial cooperation can improve group welfare. The evidence that punishment is detrimental stems from short experiments, and in many of them payoffs improve over time. Thus, the time horizon of these experiments may be too short to fully reveal the effects of punishment. We examined whether the duration of interaction affects the efficacy of punishment by running public goods experiments with punishment and by varying the time horizon: The experiment either lasted 10 periods (labeled P10) or 50 periods (P50). Overall, our experiments show that punishment not only increases cooperation, it also makes groups and individuals better off in the long run because the costs of punishment become negligible and are outweighed by the increased gains from cooperation.

"{Procedural justice schemes may promote cooperation by assuring fair
distribution of resources and the achievement of group goals. Refunds on
investments if group goals are not achieved may make the intergroup
relationship safe, but such protections may be impractical over the long
term. The current investigation examined whether intergroup cooperation
would continue after the removal of protective refunds. Groups took part
in a multiple trial, intergroup public-goods game. Half of the groups
always had refunds, and half had refunds for only the first half of
trials. Results showed that on the first trial following the cessation
of protections, cooperation decreased for all groups despite past
performance histories. However, cooperation rebounded if past success
carried over when protections were absent. The protective refund scheme
provided the opportunity for positive intergroup relations, but
cooperative actions justifying intergroup trust were necessary for
cooperation to continue when groups were unprotected.}"
"{Punishment may deter antisocial behavior. Yet to punish is costly, and
the costs often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels
of cooperation. However, the effectiveness of punishment depends not
only on how costly it is, but also on the circumstances defining the
social dilemma. Using the snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted
a series of economic experiments to determine whether severe punishment
is more effective than mild punishment. We have observed that severe
punishment is not necessarily more effective, even if the cost of
punishment is identical in both cases. The benefits of severe punishment
become evident only under extremely adverse conditions, when to
cooperate is highly improbable in the absence of sanctions. If
cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads
to higher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative.
Presented results suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem
not only from imposed fines, but may also have a psychological
background. Small fines can do wonders in motivating us to chose
cooperation over defection, but without the paralyzing effect that may
be brought about by large fines. The later should be utilized only when
absolutely necessary.}"
"{Measures of exploitativeness evidence problems with validity and
reliability. The present set of studies assessed a new measure {[}the
Interpersonal Exploitativeness Scale (IES)] that defines
exploitativeness in terms of reciprocity. In Studies 1 and 2, 33 items
were administered to participants. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor
Analysis demonstrated that a single factor consisting of six items
adequately assess interpersonal exploitativeness. Study 3 results
revealed that the IES was positively associated with ``normal{''}
narcissism, pathological narcissism, psychological entitlement, and
negative reciprocity and negatively correlated with positive
reciprocity. In Study 4, participants competed in a commons dilemma.
Those who scored higher on the IES were more likely to harvest a greater
share of resources over time, even while controlling for other relevant
variables, such as entitlement. Together, these studies show the IES to
be a valid and reliable measure of interpersonal exploitativeness. The
authors discuss the implications of these studies.}"
"{The evolution of cooperation requires some mechanism that reduces the
risk of exploitation for cooperative individuals. Recent studies have
shown that men with wide faces are anti-social, and they are perceived
that way by others. This suggests that people could use facial width to
identify anti-social men and thus limit the risk of exploitation. To see
if people can make accurate inferences like this, we conducted a
two-part experiment. First, males played a sequential social dilemma,
and we took photographs of their faces. Second, raters then viewed these
photographs and guessed how second movers behaved. Raters achieved
significant accuracy by guessing that second movers exhibited reciprocal
behaviour. Raters were not able to use the photographs to further
improve accuracy. Indeed, some raters used the photographs to their
detriment; they could have potentially achieved greater accuracy and
earned more money by ignoring the photographs and assuming all second
movers reciprocate.}"
"{In computer-supported information exchange, people frequently tend to
withhold their own information and free-ride on the others'
contributions. In doing so, they save costs (time and effort) and
maximize their own benefit. However, if everyone behaved in this way,
there would be no information sharing at all. In this experiment, we
tested if the presentation of a random number could serve as a cognitive
anchor and influence the amount of shared information. The experimental
setting had all the features of an information-exchange dilemma. Before
participants could share information, a random generator presented a
random number. It was found that this number served as a cognitive
anchor and influenced both the participants' behavioral intentions and
their actual behavior. Particularly, the high anchor increased
cooperation, even though enhanced cooperation was obviously detrimental
to the individual's own benefit.}"
"{Indirect reciprocity in which players cooperate with unacquainted other
players having good reputations is a mechanism for cooperation in
relatively large populations subjected to social dilemma situations.
When the population has group structure, as is often found in social
networks, players in experiments are considered to show behavior that
deviates from existing theoretical models of indirect reciprocity.
First, players often show ingroup favoritism (i.e., cooperation only
within the group) rather than full cooperation (i.e., cooperation within
and across groups), even though the latter is Parcto efficient. Second,
in general, humans approximate ontgroup members' personal
characteristics, presumably including the reputation used for indirect
reciprocity, by a single value attached to the group. Humans use such a
stereotypic approximation, a phenomenon known as outgroup homogeneity in
social psychology. I propose a model of indirect reciprocity in
populations with group structure to examine the possibility of ingroup
favoritism and full cooperation. In accordance with outgroup
homogeneity, I assume that players approximate outgroup members'
personal reputations by a single reputation value attached to the group.
I show that ingroup favoritism and full cooperation are stable under
different social norms (i.e., rules for assigning reputations) such that
they do not coexist in a single model. If players are forced to
consistently use the same social norm for assessing different types of
interactions (i.e., ingroup versus outgroup interactions), only full
cooperation survives. The discovered mechanism is distinct from any form
of group selection. The results also suggest potential methods for
reducing ingroup bias to shift the equilibrium from ingroup favoritism
to full cooperation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{Past research has revealed that people have a strong tendency to respond
to others cooperative behavior with cooperation and to others'
noncooperative behavior with noncooperation. Yet it is unclear whether
or not this tendency still holds when people have only incomplete
information about their interaction partner's past behavior. To address
this question, we designed a new paradigm - a coin allocation paradigm -
in which participants were provided with incomplete information about
another person's degree of cooperative behavior (i.e., coin allocations
to the participant). Consistent with our hypotheses, two experiments
revealed that incompleteness of information undermines both expectations
about another person's cooperation as well as one's own cooperation.
Moreover, complementary analyses indicated that the detrimental effects
of incompleteness of information on cooperation were mediated by
expectations of other's cooperation. We suggest that a relatively strong
belief in self-interest serves to fill in the blanks when information is
incomplete, which undermines expectations of other's cooperation as well
as one's own cooperative behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

"Because costly punishment is not credible, subgame perfection suggests that punishment will not deter free riding, regardless of the size or structure of groups. However, experiments show that people will punish free riders, even at considerable cost. To examine the implications of agents who punish, we simulate an environment populated with behavioral strategies seen in the lab and use the simulation to develop hypotheses about why group size should matter when punishment is allowed. We test these hypotheses experimentally and examine whether the effect of group size is purely due to the number of group members or if information about other group members is what is important. We find that large groups contribute at rates no lower than small groups because punishment does not fall appreciably in large groups. However, hindrances to monitoring do reduce the provision of the public good. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The present research examined the effects of endowment size, provision point level and the opportunity to voice one's opinion on contributions in asymmetric public good dilemmas. Results from a first experiment showed that group members endowed with more resources contributed more when the required threshold for obtaining a public good was high rather than low. 'Rich' participants who reported that their personal contribution was more critical for success contributed more. However, most groups failed to surpass the high provision point threshold level. Results from a second experiment reveal that 'rich' participants given voice, contributed more than 'rich' participants not given a voice. Voice contributed to greater feelings of inclusiveness, higher contributions and increased the likelihood that the group surpassed the high provision point level.

"The present research examined the moderating effect of the level of threshold on people's preferences for different leader types in step-level public good dilemmas. It was assumed that the primary focus of people in step-level public good dilemmas is to make sure that the group surpasses the threshold. Consequently, when the level of threshold is difficult to reach people are expected to provide more support for and cooperate with a leader that monitors and controls the contributions made toward the public good. However, if the threshold is easy to surpass people will focus more on whether the obtained public good or bonus will be distributed according to agreements, suggesting that people will provide more support to and cooperate with a leader that monitors and controls the distribution of the bonus. These predictions were confirmed across two experiments using a step-level public good paradigm with a dichotomous (Study 1) and a continuous (Study 2) contribution choice. Moreover, the results also revealed that perceptions of trust accounted, in part, for the effect of level of threshold on people's leadership preferences.

"Previous research has not been conclusive as to whether people prefer different or identical allocation principles in distributions of positive and negative outcomes. Thus, in this study, the question of whether or not group goal accounts for preferred allocation of positive and negative outcomes was posed. As hypothesized for division of surpluses, the results showed that relationship-oriented goals predicted preferences for equality, whereas performance-oriented goals predicted preferences for equity. Moreover, the results were the same for allocation of deficits. This suggests that people implicitly have different orientations, or goals, in mind in group situations that similarly influence the way they prefer to allocate positive and negative outcomes. The results also showed that participants allocating deficits deviated to a larger extent from the allocation principles than did participants allocating surpluses.

"Despite a large theoretical and empirical literature on public goods and common-pool resources, a systematic comparison of these two types of social dilemmas is lacking. In fact, there is some confusion about these two types of dilemma situations. As a result, they are often treated alike. In line with the theoretical literature, the authors argue that the degree of rivalry is the fundamental difference between the two games. Furthermore, they experimentally study behavior in a quadratic public good and a quadratic common-pool resource game with identical Pareto-optimum but divergent interior Nash equilibria. The results show that participants clearly perceive the differences in rivalry. Aggregate behavior in both games starts relatively close to Pareto efficiency and converges quickly to the respective Nash equilibrium. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Much research indicates that social value orientation, a trait-level preference for self and other outcomes in interdependent situations, predicts cooperation in social dilemmas. Also, perceptions of self-efficacy relate to cooperation in social dilemmas, with low-efficacy predicting low cooperation. The current research predicts that a temporal perspective of a public goods dilemma moderates each of these effects in systematically different ways. Research on Construal Level Theory (CLT) suggests that decision information of distant future events are construed more abstractly than the same information regarding near future events. If distant future decisions facilitate abstract construal of information, then this information may be more readily compared to abstract reference values, such as social values. Also, if a near future perspective facilitates low-level construal of behavioral alternatives, then self-efficacy, which is a feasibility concern, should be more strongly related to cooperative intentions in such perspective, relative to a distant future perspective. The results failed to support both interaction hypotheses and will be discussed in the context of social dilemmas, values, self-efficacy, and CLT.

"In three experiments, participants were faced with a social dilemma in which they could benefit themselves, the group, or other group members as individuals. The results showed that participants who felt high empathy toward a certain individual allocated more resources to the target of empathy, but without reducing the collective good. Then, we adapted the measure of empathy developed by Batson and colleagues (Batson, Ahmad, et al., 1999; Batson, Batson, et al., 1995) to the Spanish context. The results of Experiment 3 supported the existence of a new process: awareness of other individuals present in the social dilemma. It is proposed that this process is independent of those typically studied in research of this field: self-interest, group identification, and the empathy for a specific individual.

"Exchanging information through a shared database is a social dilemma. Each member of a work group saves costs by not contributing any information and by using the database only to retrieve information that was contributed by others. But if all people act according to this strategy, then the database is empty and useless for each group member. This article describes how standards influence people's behavior in this information-exchange dilemma. Based on assumptions about anchoring processes and processes of social comparison, the authors expect guidelines (as anchors) and feedback about others' behavior (as social standards) to influence people's information exchange. The first experiment indicates that arbitrary guidelines serve as behavioral anchors and influence people's contribution behavior-but only if the guidelines are made salient enough. The second experiment shows that bogus feedback about teammates' high or low contribution rates provoke the participants to conform to the behavior of the others.

"Previous social dilemma research has shown that sanctioning defection may enhance cooperation. The authors argue that this finding may have resulted from restricting participants to two behaviors (cooperation and defection). In this article, the authors introduce the concept of a 'social trilemma' (a social dilemma in which an alternative option to defect is present) and tested the effect of a sanction. The authors show that a sanction only increased cooperation and collective interests in the traditional social dilemma. In a social trilemma, the sanction failed because it caused some people to choose the alternative option to defect. Moreover, the results indicate that this was especially the case when people did not expect fellow group members to cooperate. In this case, the sanction even worked counterproductive because it decreased collective interests. It is concluded that allowing individuals to consider alternative options to defect can reveal the potential detrimental effects of sanctioning systems for the collective.

In this study, the two theories are integrated to show how performance comparisons with members of another team increase or decrease cooperation in an intra-team social dilemma. 111 MBA and undergraduate students participated in a laboratory experiment that finds that comparison of performance across competitive teams generates cooperation when the comparison is favorable. A computer simulation identifies decisions processes, finding partial support for comparative information across teams acting to reinforce cooperation. It also indicates that personal consistency accounts for parts of the decision process. These processes operate in the form of a rule called Win-Stay/Lose-Revert.

Players receiving high pay-off tended to make the choice closer to the solution predicated by the Nash Equilibrium than those with low pay-off. 3) Group size and feedback information had little effect on the game behavior.

"Three experimental studies examined the relationship between altruistic behavior and the emergence of status hierarchies within groups. In each study, group members were confronted with a social dilemma in which they could either benefit themselves or their group.

In both Studies 1 and 2, the most altruistic members gained the highest status in their group and were most frequently preferred as cooperative interaction partners. Study 3 showed that as the costs of altruism increase, the status rewards also increase.

"In situations of computer-mediated communication and computer-supported cooperation, a central challenge lies in increasing the willingness of those involved to share their information with the other group members. In the experimental work presented here, a shared-database setting is selected as a prototypical situation of net-based information exchange and examined from a social-dilemma perspective: the individual who contributes information to a shared database must reckon with costs and no benefits. The most efficient strategy from the perspective of the individual is thus to withhold information. Previous research has shown that a group-awareness tool which provides information about the contribution behavior of group members influences people's information-exchange behavior. In order to examine the psychological processes underlying these effects of group awareness in more detail, the present study adopts an interactional approach, according to which person-situation interaction is investigated. Certain personality traits (interpersonal trust, sensation seeking, and self-monitoring) were measured and several hypotheses tested regarding the reactions of individuals with high and low trait values to different types of awareness information. Results demonstrate that awareness tools providing information about highly cooperative group members encourage participants to trust one another and minimize the risk of being exploited. When an awareness tool additionally provides feedback about the contribution behavior of single individuals, it becomes an opportunity for self-presentation. In conclusion, an interactional approach which considers personality traits and situational factors in a net-based information-exchange situation provides new insights into both the influence processes of group awareness and the connection of these processes to specific personality traits with respect to contribution behavior.

"For centuries economists and psychologists (Frank, 1988; Ketelaar, 2004; Smith, 1759) have argued that moral emotions motivate cooperation. Ketelaar and Au (2003) recently found first evidence that guilt increases cooperation for proselfs in social bargaining games. We investigated whether this effect would also occur for shame, another moral emotion. Using a dyadic social dilemma game in Experiment 1 and an everyday cooperation measure in Experiment 2 as measures for short-term cooperation, we replicated Ketelaar and Au's findings for guilt. However, as predicted on the basis of previous emotion research, we found no such effect for shame. These results clearly indicate that the effects of moral emotions on cooperative behaviour can only be understood if the specific moral emotion is known.

"This study investigates the relationship between level of trust and cooperative behaviours in a social dilemma. We argue that this relationship should depend on the basis of trust (cognition-versus affect-based) and on beliefs about the equality of resource endowments. Results supported our prediction that increasing affect-based trust increases cooperation, but increasing cognition-based trust to a certain level can reduce cooperation because of free-riding tendency. Moreover, these effects of trust are stronger for individuals who believed that other group members had more resources than they did. Thus, our study demonstrates that higher levels of trust do not necessarily encourage cooperation. Implications of these findings are discussed.

"A low second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) has been related to high testosterone levels and to markers of high status. In a social dilemma context status can be obtained either by acting egoistically (i.e. not contributing one's share) or by acting altruistically (i.e. contributing more than one's fair share). We therefore predicted that a low 2D:4D would be associated with high levels of egoism and altruism and low levels of common cooperativeness (i.e. contributing exactly one's fair share). We found the exact opposite: participants with a low 2D:4D were more likely to act cooperatively and less likely to act altruistically and egoistically. These findings suggest that: (1) there might be a high and a low testosterone strategy to gain status and (2) the high testosterone strategy is characterized by a preference for normative behavior.

The results corroborate our line of reasoning. When the size of the resource was certain, proselfs as well as prosocials anchored their decisions on the equal division rule. Under resource size uncertainty, the equal division rule appeared to lose its coordinating potential, inducing proselfs to harvest more than prosocials.

"Despite the pervasive use of promises and threats in social life, very little research has been devoted to examining the effectiveness of these interpersonal tactics in promoting cooperation in social dilemmas. Based on the Goal-Prescribes-Rationality principle, we hypothesized that cooperation should be most strongly enhanced when promises and threats are communicated in combination, rather than in isolation. Also, we hypothesized that the combination of promises and threats should be especially effective among individuals with prosocial rather than proself orientations. Two studies provided good evidence for the latter hypothesis, in that the combination of promises and threats was only effective in people with prosocial orientations, people who are concerned with equality and collective interest.

"Past research has shown that people with prosocial orientations exercise restraint when collectively shared resources are close to being depleted, whereas people with proself orientations tend to maintain high levels of consumption. This research seeks to extend this important finding by examining whether the presence of noise in social-ecological interaction may modify the effects of social values in a commons dilemma. Participants were taking resources from a gradually declining pool. For half of the participants, the intended consumption was subject to incidental increases in consumption (negative noise). Consistent with hypotheses, noise exerted detrimental effects on cooperation when resources became scarce, yet these effects were only observed for prosocials, not for proselfs. These results indicate that noise in social-ecological interaction plays an important role in common-pool management. It tends to undermine cooperation among those who are otherwise inclined to save resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"While many experiments demonstrate that behavior differs from the predictions of traditional economic theory, they have not shown that economic reasoning is necessarily incorrect. Instead, these experiments illustrate that the preferences of homo economicus have been mis-specified. Modeled with social preferences, it may be rational for agents to forego material gains. Social dilemmas are examples in which punishment is not credible and yet people often pay to reprimand other participants. At the same time, we show that these people also react to changes in the price of punishing and income as if punishment was an ordinary and inferior good.

In accordance with functional perspectives on the role of discrete emotions, we found fear to reduce, and guilt to increase levels of cooperation. Moreover, we showed individual differences in the effect of induced emotional states. Specifically, results indicated that inducing fear reduced cooperation only for individuals with a pro-social value orientation, and that guilt induction increased cooperation only for individuals with a pro-self value orientation. We also established that both social value orientations could be adequately described in terms of differences in chronically accessible goals (as assessed by value-importance ratings). These results, therefore, seem to support our hypothesis that individual differences in the behavioral consequences of induced emotional states are related to variation in chronic accessibility of general goals associated with a particular emotional state.

Here we combine advances in experimental economics and evolutionary biology that separately have shown that costly punishment and reputation formation, respectively, induce cooperation in social dilemmas. The mechanisms of punishment and reputation, however, substantially differ in their means for 'disciplining' non-cooperators. Direct punishment incurs salient costs for both the punisher and the punished, whereas reputation mechanisms discipline by withholding action, immediately saving costs for the 'punisher'. Consequently, costly punishment may become extinct in environments in which effective reputation building--for example, through indirect reciprocity--provides a cheaper and powerful way to sustain cooperation. Unexpectedly, as we show here, punishment is maintained when a combination with reputation building is available, however, at a low level. Costly punishment acts are markedly reduced although not simply substituted by appreciating reputation. Indeed, the remaining punishment acts are concentrated on free-riders, who are most severely punished in the combination. When given a choice, subjects even prefer a combination of reputation building with costly punishment. The interaction between punishment and reputation building boosts cooperative efficiency. Because punishment and reputation building are omnipresent interacting forces in human societies, costly punishing should appear less destructive without losing its deterring force.

"This article presents a refined explanation of why minimal group identities affect cooperation in social dilemmas. The refined approach builds on key tenets of social identity theory to argue that identity affects cooperation by leading actors to maximize ingroup outcomes and minimize ingroup inequalities. A key implication of the argument is that social identity is predicted to reduce actors' responses to the 'greed component' in social dilemmas (the incentive to 'free-ride' on others' cooperation), but that it will not affect actors' responses to the 'fear component' (the motivation to avoid being 'suckered'). These predictions stand in contrast to those of two existing explanations of social identity and cooperation. The three arguments are tested against the results of two new experiments. Overall, the results support the refined approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In social dilemmas, equality is an important coordination rule. When equality is violated, people seek explanations. In Experiment 1, the authors assessed dispositional trust and found that especially high trusters were affected by the given explanation. High trusters reacted less negatively to external than internal explanations. Experiment 2, using a manipulation of trust in others, revealed a similar pattern across a wider range of negative emotions. In Experiment 3, the authors only induced high trust and showed that when the external explanation turned out to be a lie, emotional and retributive reactions became more negative. Moreover, attribution information did not influence reactions when participants realized that the information was dishonest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Sanctioning systems in social dilemmas are often meant to increase trust in others and to increase cooperation. We argue, however, that sanctioning systems may also give people the idea that others act in their own self-interest and undermine the belief that others are internally motivated to cooperate. We developed the 'Removing The Sanction' paradigm and a new trust manipulation, and showed in three experiments that when there is a sanction on defection, trust in others being internally motivated to cooperate is undermined: Participants who had experienced the presence of a sanctioning system trusted fellow group members less than participants who had not. In a similar vein, the sanction undermined cooperation when trust was initially high. The implications of these paradoxical findings are discussed.

"249 male postgraduate students of management played the Prisoner's Dilemma game and filled out a postgame questionnaire measuring attitude toward the 'other player.' Striking differences resulted between trusting and trustworthy Ss and suspicious and untrustworthy Ss with respect to meanings given to the dimension of trust (cooperation) in the interaction. As predicted, trusting behavior of the other player was given a positive evaluative meaning—good vs bad—by the trusting and trustworthy Ss and a negative dynamism meaning—weak vs strong—by the suspicious and untrustworthy Ss. Trusting Ss expected the typical other to make either trusting or suspicious moves, whereas the suspicious Ss expected the typical other to be uniformly suspicious. While 51% of trusting Ss thought that the other player was a female, 81% of the suspicious Ss thought so. (French abstract) (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Cognitive factors, a virtually neglected class of variables in Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game literature, were examined in relation to cooperative play. Following completion of 4 paper and pencil tests of cognitive abilities, 48 pairs of undergraduates played a 30-trial PD game. Those Ss above the median on abstract information-processing ability, quantitative ability, and verbal ability were more likely to achieve a cooperative resolution of the PD than those below the median on these variables. Results suggest that cognitive variables rather than personality variables are of more importance in determining game play. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"An adaptation of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory was administered to 106 male and 95 female undergraduates who rated the university's computer in terms of male and female characteristics. Subsequently 2 experimental groups of Ss played 100 trials of a Prisoner's Dilemma game against a computer 'other,' which adopted a noncontingent 80% cooperative strategy. Ss identified the computer as having male characteristics, and in the game situation they played as though playing against a male opponent. Males tried to exploit the other, whereas females acquiesced to the characteristics ascribed to the machine. Results demonstrate the value of experimental games as tools for psychological research.

"A model for gaming behavior in sequences of Prisoner's Dilemma games is proposed; the model takes into consideration the players' expectations regarding their partner's choice.

"80 undergraduates in 4-person groups played repeated trials of an n-person Prisoner's Dilemma game under 2 information conditions: (a) Each player's choice was made known to the others following each trial. (b) Each S was informed only of the number of others who cooperated or competed on each trial. The 1st condition was a 'public choice' situation, while the 2nd was an 'anonymous choice' situation. The data support the hypothesis that there would be greater cooperation in the public choice than in the anonymous choice condition, since the former created a situation in which the individual would be made accountable to the group for the consequences of his or her choices. Results are discussed in terms of the various manipulations of group process that can produce deindividuation (i.e., a lessening of the individual's propensity to behave in a socially approved manner).

"M. D. Sahlins (1975) proposed a model of reciprocity for social interaction citing 3 forms drawn from observations of kinship systems: an altruistic form of reciprocity, a balanced or economic form, and a negative form in which individuals try to outdo each other. This model was applied to a 2-person variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma game where 60 college students were each paired with a confederate (also college students) who responded over trials entirely generously, contingently generously, or nongenerously. 30 Ss were informed that there would be 10 trials while the other 30 were uninformed. Basically, Ss tended to match the generosity level of the confederate and were less generous when trial number was known. Evidence for Sahlins' model was provided by Ss' reports of reasons for their choices in the game. Those in the generous condition gave reasons for reciprocating based on a general feeling of obligation, trust, and desire to cooperate. Ss in the contingently generous condition gave reasons for reciprocating based on economic exchange and a desire to maintain a balance of resources. Ss in the nongenerous condition gave reasons based on a desire to take what profits one could before the other got them. Ss also showed a significant tendency to exploit the other on the final trial under the informed condition for the contingently generous but not for the generous condition.

"30 male undergraduates played 100 trials of the Prisoner's Dilemma game under 1 of 3 experimental conditions ( N = 10 in each): in Condition 1 the other player was portrayed as being of higher status than the Ss; in Condition 2, of equal status with the Ss; and in Condition 3, of lower status than the Ss. In reality, in all 3 conditions, the Other Player was simulated by a probability randomizer previously programmed to play a predetermined strategy. Results indicate that Ss playing with equal-status others were significantly more competitive than Ss playing with either higher- or lower-status others. Findings are interpreted in accord with earlier research on individual differences in game behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Compared the effect on cooperative behavior of 2 response-contingent payoff structures with the invariant payoff structure of the standard Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. 100 male undergraduate dyads played a 20-trial PD game that either (a) rewarded joint cooperation by increased profits, (b) punished joint competition by increased costs, (c) both rewarded cooperation and punished competition, or (d) left payoffs constant. Half of the pairs played for real money and half played for points. Although punishment led to higher cooperation than either reward or constant payoffs, Ss perceived themselves as more cooperative under the reward contingency. Findings support the interpretation that a predisposition to compete leads to earlier exposure to and superior learning of the punishment contingency. It is suggested that while this facilitates cooperative behavior, it may undermine cooperative motivation. Finally, real-money payoffs significantly increased both interdyad variability and intradyad uniformity in cooperative behavior. This effect of reward size on response variation is viewed as a threat to the external validity of conflict studies that have used only trivial rewards.

"Based on an outcome maximization hypothesis, 56 male undergraduates were predicted to respond optimally in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with anticipated shock outcomes. As expected, cooperation was significantly higher for 100% lag-one contingent matching feedback conditions than for noncontingent yoked-control conditions; also, cooperation increased over trials for contingent Ss and decreased over trials for noncontingent Ss. Man vs machine characterization of the player did not affect cooperative responding, lending more support in this situation to outcome maximization as opposed to competitive motivation and perceived-reactivity-of-the-other-player interpretations.

"Manipulated communication opportuniy and the ability to penalize other players in a design involving 13 male and 13 female undergraduates. 26 pentads first played 40 trials of a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game with no information as to how the payoffs were determined. After being instructed on the payoff matrix, one third of the groups were not allowed to communicate, one-third were allowed to talk in an effort to coordinate their responses, and one-third were provided both an opportunity to talk and a means of exacting a sanction against Ss who failed to cooperate. In contrast to 2-person PD games, no effects of sex were found. A highly significant effect of communication was found, with groups in the sanction condition emitting more cooperative and more repeated cooperative responses and earning more points. Questionnaire data indicate a declining trend from the information-only condition through the sanction condition in the tendency for Ss to list maximization of their own scores as one of their objectives. The data suggest the following: (a) Informing people of how they are interdependent--and how they can improve their scores at the expense of others--does not appreciably change their behavior. (b) (Encouragement of communication is also ineffective in creating increased cooperation. (c) The availability of disciplinary sanctions can provide an effective means for increasing cooperation.

"In an experiment with 100 male undergraduates, 8 groups of experimental Ss observed a staged, modeled Prisoner's Dilemma game, then played themselves; Ss in the control condition played without first being exposed to the modeled game. In the modeled game either both confederates (the model and his opponent) responded predominantly cooperatively, both responded predominantly competitively, or one competed while the other cooperated. Also, the opponent for experimental Ss was either one of the participants in the modeled game or an unfamiliar person. Results are as follows: (a) Observing either a mutually cooperative game or a mutually competitive game enhanced cooperation from the S when he played the game. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation by the model's opponent leads to imitation of the model's responses. (b) Ss would cooperate with an opponent they had seen behave cooperatively, even if he appeared exploitable. (c) The greatest amount of cooperation was exhibited by Ss playing an unfamiliar other after they had observed a mutually competitive game.

"Conducted a study of the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game with 80 male undergraduates in Swedish colleges to explore the 'boredom' hypothesis, which explains the usual finding of high competition as the outcome of Ss' attempts to alleviate their boredom by trying to outscore one another. Dyads played a 15-trial PD game in which boredom was manipulated by varying both the pattern of rewards sequentially over trials as well as by reward size, real money vs points. As expected, Ss' ratings of boredom were lowest with variable rewards and when playing for money. Cooperation was affected by variable rewards only in the points condition where boredom was highest. However, the same factors which reduced boredom significantly increased interdyad variability. The relationship between this latter finding and the validity of replicated PH games with constant rewards is discussed. (26 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Explored the relationship between group size and member cooperation when individual and group interests conflict. A theoretically based typology that identifies 9 systematic patterns associated with changes in group size and parameters of individual and group payoff structure is presented. The typology describes 9 different ways in which group size can affect cooperation in the provision of public goods (e.g., gain is constant--temptation increases with group size). In a computer-administered experiment using 3 of these 9 types and group sizes of 3, 6 and 9, 90 college students were given sequences of opportunities to choose between 'cooperation' (which benefited everyone) and 'noncooperation' (which benefited the chooser but harmed everyone else). For one of these types, a counter-intuitive but theoretically predicted positive relationship between group size and cooperation was found. Two explanations for a theoretically unexpected negative relation between group size and cooperation in the other conditions are developed, one based on I. D. Steiner's (1972) concept of a conjunctive task, the other based on the decreasing information value of responses in larger groups.

"Investigated the influence of assumptions regarding human nature, expectations of opponent's initial behavior, and early game interpersonal behavior on subsequent levels of cooperation with 236 undergraduates in a mixed motive, non-zero-sum game. It was hypothesized that differential effects for males and females may be due to their different assumptions, expectations, and different responses to initial interpersonal behavior. It was found that (a) women had a more positive view of human nature, however assumptions about human nature were not related to initial expectations or behavior; (b) women had a slightly higher expectation of cooperation from their opponents and this was highly related to initial cooperation; (c) women had more unconfirmed expectations of cooperation and for women this was negatively related to early game levels of cooperation; and (d) initial levels of cooperation and early game interpersonal patterns of cooperation were an important influence on later levels of game behavior and these factors were more influential for males.

"Used a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial design to examine the effects of commitment to future interaction (committed or uncommitted), relative power (high or low) and the structure of interdependence (Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken, or No Conflict). The dependent variable was the proportion of cooperative choices on a series of single-play game matrices. Data were collected from 120 undergraduates who responded either cooperatively or competitively to 18 game matrices. Each matrix was presented individually and without feedback concerning previous outcomes. As hypothesized, the results show an interaction between commitment and power. Low reward power Ss were more cooperative when uncommitted than when committed in Chicken and the No-Conflict game. High power Ss were more cooperative when committed than when uncommitted in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Results suggest caution when generalizing from the prevalent propositions that low power and commitment to future interaction have a cooperative effect.

"After manipulation of dyad cohesiveness, 72 college students played a differential power game from the position of low power. Their simulated opponent of high power accorded them benefits (reward) on 0, 50, or 100% of the trials. Subsequently the roles were reversed so that the S had the high power and the opportunity to reward his opponent. Finally, Ss played a 1-trial Prisoner's Dilemma game. Results for the power game indicate that the amount of reward the S gave to his opponent depended upon both the opponent's earlier level of reward and cohesiveness. However, only the cohesiveness manipulation influenced the Prisoner's Dilemma game, with unusually high cooperation resulting overall. Additional analyses showed that (a) reciprocation (either reciprocal giving or reciprocal withholding of reward) in the power game promoted cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma and (b) cohesiveness affected the Prisoner's Dilemma game responses of only those Ss uncertain of which response to expect from their opponent.

"An experiment employed the Prisoner's Dilemma game to explore possible differences in problem solving preference across a spectrum of motion sickness susceptibility. The dilemma was presented to 257 businessmen who had been rated for motion sickness susceptibility and divided into 3 groups accordingly. A mathematical form of the problem was used in which Ss were asked to imagine playing a game without communicating with his/her hypothetical partner. There were 3 possible solutions to the problem: win-win, lose-lose, and win-lose. Results support the contention that a cognitive bias exists across a spectrum of motion sickness susceptibility, highly motion-sick individuals having a greater tendency to pick the solution that allows both participants to win. This bias runs counter to that which might be expected on the basis of personality traits (non-motion-sick individuals are more socially involved) and suggest that the cognitive tendency may reflect basic problem-solving strategies rooted in orientation process.

A sociometric instrument, the Ohio Social Acceptance Scale, was administered to 89 10th-grade students to assess inclusion and affection. 24 of the resulting dyads were randomly selected for the study. Control conditions were established by the Prisoner's Dilemma game in terms of the asymmetry of the payoff matrix and fate control. Six variables reflecting trust and the quality of the interpersonal interaction were assessed in 8 10-choice games. Significant results in the predicted direction were obtained on the fate control dimension but not on the asymmetry, inclusion, or affection dimensions. Players who exercised fate control (a) gave higher estimates of their partner's trustworthiness than their partners not exercising fate control, (b) received fewer years in jail than their partners, and (c) had partners who received more years in jail than those who did not exercise fate control.

"Conducted 2 experiments with 183 male and 184 female undergraduates in which Ss either as individuals or as groups, participated in a Prisoner's Dilemma and could communicate either threats of punishment for target noncooperation or promises of their own cooperation. In Exp I they opposed a live target; In Exp II they opposed a simulated target who was either cooperative or competitive in response to the Ss' messages. Overall results show that groups more strongly preferred the use of threats than did individuals. Groups were more competitive than individuals at the outset in both experiments; in Exp II the difference was found consistently on the message-related trials. In Exp II there was also a series of interactions generally showing that individual women opposing a cooperative target were most cooperative and conciliatory, while men in groups opposing a competitive target were most competitive and coercive. Postexperimental ratings of the simulated target indicated a polarization of impressions in the groups. Women targets in Exp I were more cooperative against individuals than against groups; there was no difference for men. Targets opposing groups rated the opponent as less likable and less credible than targets opposing individuals. (16 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Examined the relationships of sex-role orientation and defensiveness to competitive behavior during Prisoner's Dilemma game (PDG) playing. 57 female university students of differing sex-role orientations (French and Lesser Student Attitude Scale) and levels of defensiveness (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale) played a PDG with a woman identified as either traditionally or career-oriented, but who was actually a confederate using a nonresponsive 60% cooperative strategy. To facilitate avoidance of competition, matrix values minimized the pull toward defection, and a 3rd self-protective choice was provided as an alternative to unilateral cooperative sacrifice. Results show that Ss rejecting the traditional feminine role consistently avoided competition, regardless of their level of defensiveness, and particularly when the other was similar in orientation. For Ss endorsing both traditional and career values, low defensiveness corresponded with avoidance of competition, while high defensiveness corresponded with competitive behavior, similar to that of traditionally oriented women. Both sex-role orientation and defensiveness demonstrated their usefulness as individual difference dimensions affecting the behavior of women in the PDG.

"Notes that social actors routinely assume that others with whom they interact are fully social, i.e., fundamentally capable of intent, communication, and consensus. These routine assumptions were made problematic in an experiment with 24 male undergraduates where Ss were required to interact with 2 different opponents in a Prisoner's Dilemma game playing situation: a computer opponent and an allegedly human opponent. Both opponents were actually simulated by a computer program. Results show that in many cases where the 2 simulated opponents played identically, Ss perceived marked differences between them and defined the computer opponent as incapable of meaningful interaction. Other Ss, who did not differentiate between the social capabilities of the 2 opponents, seemed to respond in a 'dehumanized' fashion toward the human opponent following their encounter with the computer opponent. It is concluded that this experiment demonstrates basic differences between communicative action, which is mediated by consensual understandings, and instrumental action, which is based on technical strategies.

There was a tendency for Ss high in trust to be more exploitative in their first use of promises than were the low scorers, but the situational factor of target credibility had much stronger behavioral effects.

"Used a nonmatrix version of a 2-person, non-zero-sum simulation game of the Prisoner's Dilemma type, with 3 decision possibilities (cooperative, competitive, and escaping) to investigate 3 hypotheses: (a) Schizophrenics show more escape choices than nonschizophrenics.

Three simulated stooge-strategies and 2 variations in communication were introduced, with 96 Ss of 3 diagnostic categories (schizophrenic, nonschizophrenic-psychiatric, and nonclinical) participating in like-diagnosis dyads. Results fully support hypotheses (b) and (c) and support hypothesis (a) for the free-communication condition only.

"In 5 experimental conditions, a total of 96 male undergraduates were given information about how their opponent-to-be in a forthcoming Prisoner's Dilemma game had played and fared in a game played previously.

A control condition gave no information about the previous game. Ss tended to cooperate in Conditions (a), (b), and (e), i.e., with opponents who appeared worthy of trust, and to compete in Conditions (c), (d), and the control, i.e., with opponents who appeared to be exploitative.

"60 female undergraduates opposed a simulated opponent in a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game. At first Ss communicated threats of a 10-point penalty if the opponent did not cooperate. When Ss did penalize, the opponent could retaliate with 0, 5, 10, or 20 points. After the 1st penalty and retaliation, the opponent became the communicator and sent a series of honest promises of cooperation to the Ss. As hypothesized, Ss whose penalties had been reciprocated with equal retaliation were more cooperative on the 1st block of promise trials than were 20-point or 5-point Ss, but this effect dissipated, presumably because the opponent was not programed to reciprocate with a competitive choice if the promised cooperation was exploited. The opponent in the zero retaliation condition was not significantly less effective with conciliatory promises than the equal retaliation opponent.

An attempt was made to replicate with females a previous finding by the author (see record [rid]1977-10027-001[/rid]) that preadolescent boys involved in a chum relationship exhibited significantly greater levels of altruistic behavior than those without a chum. 32 5th- and 6th-grade girls were chosen from a larger group of 105 because they indicated on 3 measures (a test of friendship stability, a 'chumship checklist,' and a best friend preference question) that they had a chum relationship. 32 additional girls (matched for IQ and sociometric popularity) who indicated they did not have a chum relationship were controls. Both groups completed the Altruism subscale of the Scale of Social Responsibility and participated in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. ANOVA revealed that the chum group scored significantly higher on both measures of altruism than Ss without chums. Results are consistent with both the author's study and Sullivan's chum theory.

"Utilized cooperative behavior to measure the predictive validity of the Social Interest Index (SII) by administering it to 131 male and 159 female high school students. High and low social interest (HSI and LSI) groups were formed consisting of Ss who scored .5 standard deviations or more above or .5 standard deviations or more below the mean SII score for all Ss. 35 pairs of Ss were randomly chosen from each group to play the Prisoner's Dilemma game (PD), which was used as a measure of cooperative behavior. Each pair played PD for 20 trials for a monetary incentive. Results show that the HSI Ss cooperated significantly more than LSI Ss both overall and on the 1st trial of PD.

"Examined speculations by D. M. Dawes et al (see record [rid]1977-25298-001[/rid]) concerning the extent to which persons use their own responses in mixed-motive situations as a basis for predicting the behavior of others. 172 female undergraduates played a 1-trial Prisoner's Dilemma game and predicted the responses of their partner and a person in another dyad. As predicted, Ss, irrespective of the particular choice they had made, tended to attribute their own response to others. In many Ss, this attribution appeared to be self-justifying, in that it was specific to the S's partner. Even more frequently, Ss attributed their own response to both partner and nonpartner (i.e., a false consensus), although they also tended to be more confident about their prediction of their partner's choice.

"Assessed the utility of a control-based analysis of crowding by examining the relationship between prolonged exposure to architecturally mediated social density and motivational deficits characteristic of learned helplessness. It was predicted that initial recognition of uncontrollable social outcomes would arouse negative interpersonal affect and generate attempts to restore control. Residents of long- and short-corridor-design dormitories, required to live in large and moderate size groups, were surveyed and considered in an experimental session following 1, 3, or 7 wks of residence. Frequent contact with unfamiliar neighbors and visitors in the relatively uncontrolled hallway of the long corridor was seen as generating crowding and difficulty in regulating interpersonal contact. As expectations for control diminished, helpless responding was expected to increase. To test these hypotheses, 60 dormitory residents completed surveys, and 60 participated in an experiment in which they played a Prisoner's Dilemma game that was modified so as to assess helplessness. Data confirm the predictions, indicating that the effects of loss of regulatory control in high-density residential settings were sequential and were mediated by expectations for control. Residents of the long-corridor dormitory, compared with short-corridor residents, were more competitive, reactive, and involved with reestablishing control after 1 and 3 wks of residence. By the end of 7 wks, however, they had become more withdrawn, were less involved, and exhibited symptoms of helplessness. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"42 same-sex pairs of varied racial composition were randomly selected from 8th graders in each of 2 matched schools, with open- vs closed-space architectural styles. Open-space Ss were more likely to develop cooperative interdependence in a mixed-motive game (a decomposed prisoner's dilemma) and were more inclined to make proximal seating choices indicative of anticipated peer interaction. A Sex by Race by Trial Blocks interaction effect reflected different patterns of responding for males and females. Females of either race learned to cooperate in same-race pairs and to compete in mixed-race pairs. White males learned to cooperate and Black males to compete independent of their partner's race.

In each same-sex group of 9 college students, individuals played a Prisoner's Dilemma game against a confederate. Ss with a dominant response of competition when playing under alone conditions were exposed to a Previous Winners, Human Relations, or No Audience condition. Results show that compared to the No Audience, the Previous Winners audience facilitated and the Human Relations audience inhibited competition.

"Three modes of behavior have been hypothesized in response to the Prisoner's Dilemma game and other cooperative/competitive games: a behavior mode that maximizes one's own gain, a behavior mode that maximizes joint gain, and a mode that maximizes relative gain. Since all behavior is a function, in part, of the individual's personality, it was hypothesized in the present study that a distinct personality pattern would be expected to be associated with each mode. Using a decomposed game format offering 3 unique choices and the EPPS, the responses of 239 12th-grade students were analyzed in a 2-factor multivariate ANOVA model. Although 3 unique response groups were identified, only 2 distinct personality patterns emerged: a joint and an own-relative mode. Proposed explanations of these findings include the interaction of personality structure with authoritarianism and with cognitive and ego/moral developmental stages.

"Tested whether the Adlerian concept of social interest as measured by the author's Social Interest Scale (SIS) could be related to cooperative behavior. The SIS consists of 15 pairs of characteristics, with one trait relevant to social interest and one that is not. The SIS score is the number of social interest traits chosen by the person. In Exp I, 30 male and 55 female undergraduates took the SIS and participated in a version of the Prisoner's Dilemma game which rewarded competitive responses over cooperative ones. A significant correlation was found between SIS scores and number of cooperative responses. In Exp II, 24 of the original Ss were asked whether they would be interested in aiding a local social agency which needed volunteers. Those who agreed without reservation were found to have scored significantly higher on the SIS than those who were uncertain or unwilling. Results are thought to provide validation for both the SIS and the concept of social interest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Conducted a study with 86 male undergraduates to compare the effects of direct vs vicarious experience in conflict resolution. An actor-S played a Prisoner's Dilemma game, while an observer-S observed his responses and their consequences. Each then played a subsequent, private test game against a new opponent. In all 3 games, the simulated opponents played a tit-for-tat strategy that reinforced cooperation and punished competition. Thus, the proportion of cooperative responses made was a measure of how frequently the S produced the reinforced response. Observers tended to respond more cooperatively than actors in the test game, particularly when the 1st game was marked by high degrees of mutual competition. Results are explained by assuming that an actor is more highly motivated than an observer and has greater difficulty acquiring a new response. The findings demonstrate that vicarious experience (observing) is superior to direct experience (participating) for the production of appropriate responses for reduction of interpersonal conflict.

"An experiment was conducted in an effort to clarify the nature of the relationship between frequency of exposure and interpersonal attraction. 96 female undergraduates were visually exposed to one another during each trial of a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game in which Ss' outcomes were controlled by the experimenter. The frequency of these visual encounters was varied, as was the nature of the monetary outcomes from the gaming trials (rewards vs punishment) and the attribution of responsibility for these outcomes (partners responsible vs nonresponsible). Measures of attraction indicated that, overall, more frequently viewed others were preferred to those less frequently seen. This exposure effect was most strongly obtained when the other Ss were viewed as personally responsible for delivering rewards, while either no effect or a weak negative exposure effect was found in the responsible/punish condition.

"Introduces a class of simple multiperson games to compare the effects of group size on cooperation. These games can be regarded as n-person generalizations of 2-person Prisoner's Dilemma with expected value payoffs. To ensure that identical expected-value monetary alternatives are available to players in different-sized groups, a certain formal constraint on payoffs is introduced. Results of an experimental study, with 160 undergraduates, comparing 3- and 7-person groups show that the smaller-sized group was markedly more cooperative than the larger. The paper demonstrates a technique to measure cooperation as a function of group size unconfounded by role-playing and utility considerations.

"Used a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game to examine compliance and the effects of a power reversal in a dyad. 30 male and 30 female undergraduates were first the targets of a simulated source's coercive or reward power employed with resolutely accommodative, irresolutely accommodative, or resolutely exploitative intent. Sex of S made up the final factor in the 3  2  2 factorial design. Midway through the experiment, Ss were given the opportunity to exercise reward and coercive power. Compliance fitted the cost-gains model. Although the resolutely exploitative use of power conveyed the impression of the greatest degree of potency, it did not elicit overall the greatest degree of compliance. After the power reversal, when Ss decided to use their coercive power exploitatively, they punished the simulated target's defiance most when they had previously faced the resolute sources and least when they interacted with the irresolute source. During power irrelevant interactions, Ss, in both the weak and strong power positions, reciprocated the degree of accommodative intent with which the source had used power.

The confederate punished noncompliance to threats either 10 or 90% of the time. Attraction was measured with the Interpersonal Judgment Scale. Compliance was high and unaffected by probability of punishment when the source was unattractive, while a positive relationship between threat credibility and compliance occurred when the threatener was attractive. In Exp II, high or low esteem for the confederate was induced prior to the game and the probability of punishment for noncompliance to threats was either 0 or 100%. Ss complied more frequently to the threats of a high esteem source and when the probability of punishment was high. Compliance was directly related to the probability of punishment when esteem was low, and compliance was frequent and unaffected by probability of punishment when esteem was high.

A study of acute experimental crowding was then conducted with 42 male and 42 female 18-55 yr old evening college students. Contrary to findings of prior research, the present study found that crowding produced arousal (as measured by 2 cognitive tasks). However, subsequent social behavior on the Tajfel task and Prisoner's Dilemma game was mediated by different sex-specific group processes. In general, crowded male groups displayed a competitive, fragmented orientation, whereas crowded women formed cohesive, cooperative groups. Contrary to preliminary expectations, Ss were differentially effected by crowding based on their seating position in the crowded room.

Partners (always fictitious) supposedly were changed from Block 2 to Block 3. Results indicate that when a threat was received prior to the start of Block 3, it was effective in increasing cooperative behavior only when the S knew that the source had incurred losses during Block 2. In addition, this greater increase in cooperative responding was maintained when the possibility of incurring punishment was subsequently removed in Block 4. Results suggest that the source's prior losses gave justification to this use of threat and, therefore, increased compliance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Tested the H. S. Sullivan (1953) assertion that an 'other' orientation gained in preadolescence through a relationship with a close friend of the same sex can develop into a general altruistic perspective. 30 male 6th graders from an original sample of 92 met 3 criteria of having a 'chum' (friendship stability, communication, and willingness to share time) and were included in the chumship group; 30 Ss from the same original sample failed to meet these criteria and were included in the nonchumship group. Groups were matched on level of IQ and social acceptance. Analysis of Ss' responses on the Altruism subscale of the Scale of Social Responsibility and to the standard Prisoner's Dilemma game revealed that those Ss involved in a chum relationship exhibited significantly greater levels of altruism.

"To assess the generalizability of the perceptual 'triangle hypothesis' proposed by H. H. Kelley and A. J. Stahelski (see record [rid]1971-02325-001[/rid]), the expectations, perceptions, and behaviors of 70 female undergraduates were measured in 2 conflict situations. Support for the triangle hypothesis came from data gathered in a situation similar to that employed by Kelley and Stahelski. In this situation, Ss who adopted a competitive orientation tended to (a) expect more homogeneity in the orientations of their opponents than did Ss with a cooperative orientation and (b) dominate behaviorally Ss with a cooperative orientation. Neither of these effects were found in a situation which provided Ss with a more flexible behavioral repertoire. The importance of the impact of structural factors on conflict processes was further shown by an examination of the self-fulfilling prophecy effects found in the 2 situations. Preinteraction expectations had a pronounced effect on both the course of the interaction and opponent evaluations in the 1st situation, while only weak effects of preinteraction expectations were found in the 2nd, less restrictive, situation.

"Tested the hypothesis that groups in Prisoners' Dilemma-like situations that cannot sanction noncooperators (because they cannot be identified) will be more cohesive and will have stronger norms against noncooperation than will groups in which a noncooperator can be identified. This hypothesis was derived from the assumption that group norms and group cohesion are both used by groups to control their members when there is a conflict between individual and collective goals. When groups cannot identify noncooperators, the cost of noncooperation is reduced and the intensity of the conflict between individual and collective interests is increased. It was also hypothesized that the group reaction to conflict between collective and individual interests would not be different if the conflict took the form of a 'problem of order' or a 'problem of collective action.' In a laboratory experiment with 128 Ss, these hypotheses were verified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{Animals show impulsiveness when they prefer a smaller more immediate
option, even though a larger more delayed option produces a higher
intake rate. This impulsive behavior has implications for several
behavioral problems including social cooperation. This paper presents
two experiments using captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) that
consider the effects of payoff accumulation and temporal clumping on
impulsiveness and cooperation. Payoff accumulation refers to a situation
where the benefits gained from each choice trial accumulate fro, one
trial to the next, and only become available to the animal after it has
completed a fixed number of trials. We hypothesized that this would
reduce impulsiveness because it removes the advantage of quickly
realizing food gains. Clumping refers to situation in which the animal
experiences several choice trials ill quick succession followed by a
long pause before the next clump. We hypothesized that if payoffs
accumulated over a clump of trials this Would enhance the effect Of
accumulation. We tested the effects of accumulation and clumping on
impulsiveness ill a self-control situation. We found a significant
interaction between clumping and accumulation. Payoff accumulation
reduced impulsiveness, but only when trials were clumped. Post hoc
analyses suggest that clumping alone increases impulsiveness. A second
experiment applied these results to cooperation. This experiment reveal
an interaction between payoff accumulation and trial's position within
the clump. Jays were more likely to cooperate on the first trial of a
clump, but the likelihood of cooperation dropped after the first trial.
However, this drop was larger when payoffs did not accumulate. This
observation suggests that the difference between accumulated and
unaccumulated treatments that we reported previously (Science 198: 22
16-22 18) may be largely due to differences in how animals behave in the
first trial of a clump. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"

"{Experimental research has enhanced the knowledge acquired from
theoretical and field sources of when and how groups can solve the

Widespread agreement exists that cooperation can happen, but little
agreement as to how. As a first step, we propose that individuals may
use three layers of information in deciding about their level of
cooperation. The layers range from the material incentives of a specific
production function and the dynamics of the game, to the composition of
the group and the individual characteristics of the player. We use this
framework to analyze data from a set of experiments conducted with
actual ecosystem users in three rural villages of Colombia. Prior
experience of the participants, their perception of external regulation,
and the composition of the group, influence decisions to cooperate or
defect in the experiment. Understanding the multiple information levels
of a game as they affect incentives helps to explain decisions in

"{A persistent anomaly in the social dilemmas literature is the
surprisingly high level of cooperation observed in experimental
investigations of the one-shot Prisoners' Dilemma (PD). The exchange
heuristic hypothesis and related approaches explain this finding by
arguing that actors subjectively transform PD into the Assurance
Dilemma. A tendency to transform PD into Assurance is expected to
increase cooperation because defection is the dominant strategy in PD,
but not in Assurance. Although existing arguments explain the processes
through which these subjective transformations occur, they do not
predict who actually makes the transformations. This study incorporates
arguments from the social values literature and proposes four hypotheses
about who transforms PD and how this affects cooperation. The hypotheses
are tested against the results of a new experiment. The results strongly
support the hypotheses and the overarching argument that
``prosocials{''} transform PD into Assurance, while ``individualists

"{Two studies examined the influence of I primes on cooperative behavior.
Two contrasting hypotheses were tested, using prosocial allocations
(Experiment 1) and behavior in a give-some dilemma (Experiment 2) as

The self-activation hypothesis (Verplanken \& Holland, 2002) predicts
that social value orientation influences behavior to a stronger degree
when activated. That is, proselfs should behave less cooperatively,
whereas prosocials should behave even more cooperatively in an I prime
condition. The independent self-construal hypothesis (e.g., Gardner,
Gabriel, \& Lee, 1999) predicts a stronger concern for one's own outcome
and less cooperative behavior for individuals with an activated
independent self-construal. In both studies an interaction between
priming and social value orientation occurred, supporting the
self-activation hypothesis. Implications for the importance of social
cognitive processes underlying cooperative behavior, as well as,
implications for research on independent vs interdependent

"{Prior theorizing of rationality in social dilemmas suggests that
individuals pursuing different interaction goals may `perceive'
different associations between competence and behaviour in a social
dilemma, arguing that competitive individuals associate competence with
noncooperation (i.e. noncooperation = smart), whereas prosocial
individuals associate competence with cooperation (i.e. cooperation=
smart; goal-prescribes- rationality principle, Van Lange \& Kuhlman,
1994). The present research examines whether cooperative interaction can
be affected by subtle activation (or priming) of competence, and whether
the effects may differ for competitive versus prosocial participants.
Consistent with hypotheses, two experiments revealed that priming
competence yielded reduced levels of cooperation (and greater
exploitation) among competitors, and yielded no effects (Experiment 1)

prosocials. The discussion considers theoretical implications of
relatively subtle influences on cooperative interaction in social

"{Two experiments tested the effects of organizational identification on
individual decisions to cooperate. These decisions occurred in the
context of a nested social dilemma in which individuals, subgroups, and

organizations, higher organizational identification caused lower
cooperation with the collective (and higher cooperation with the
subgroup) when the opposing organization had a purportedly
individualistic culture and reputation. The results of Study 2 supported
this interpretation by showing that organizational identification had a
negative effect on collective cooperation, and a corresponding positive
effect on subgroup cooperation, when decision makers perceived the
opposing department to have an individualistic reputation. I discuss the
implications of these results for organizations that try to elicit
cooperation by fostering members' organizational identification. (C)

"{Two experiments investigated how leadership shapes individual
contributions in small group, facing public goods dilemmas. We predicted
that the influence of leaders would be determined by their ability to
fulfill both instrumental needs (solve the free-rider problem) and
relational needs (contribute to the identity) of group members. The
relative importance of these two needs was expected to vary with the
salience of group membership (social vs personal identity). This
hypothesis was supported in two experiments. Experiment 1 revealed that
leaders showing group commitment and fairness toward members were more
effective at raising contributions when social identity was salient.
Furthermore, Experiment 2 showed that highly committed leaders were more
influential when social identity was salient, whereas leaders with
intrinsic leadership skills were more influential when personal identity
was salient. This suggests that the effectiveness of leader solutions to
social dilemmas depends upon the fit between leader characteristics and
member expectations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).}"

of child care when it was a public good (provided by the municipality)

that an equal distribution of the public good was perceived to be fairer

"{The authors introduce a new team game, the intergroup chicken game, to
model intergroup conflicts involving bilateral threats (e.g., military
conflicts, industrial disputes). The group that wins the game is the one
that competes while the other group yields, and the benefits associated
with winning (e.g., territory, higher wages) are public goods for the
members of that group. However, a failure to yield on the part of both
groups leads to an outcome (e.g., war, strike) that is disastrous to all
the players. The authors report an experiment in which an intergroup
chicken game with two players on each team was compared to a two-person
chicken game and a (single-group) four-person chicken game. The games
were played repeatedly, and each round was preceded by a signaling

"{Cooperation in 2-person social dilemmas was examined when people frame
outcomes as gains or as losses. It was argued that losses loom larger
than gains and that depending on people's social motive, behavioral
options in social dilemmas are valued differently. Results of 3
experiments supported the predictions based on prospect theory and
interdependence theory: Pro-socials (cooperators) cooperated more in a
loss than in a gain frame, whereas individualists cooperated less in a
loss than in a gain frame. Unexpectedly, competitors cooperated as
little in a loss as in a gain frame, which was attributed to a floor
effect. It was concluded that this research explains inconsistent
findings from previous research on gain-loss frames and shows that
loss-framed individuals pursue their cooperative or individualistic
goals to a greater extent than gain-framed individuals but pursue their
competitive goals to about the same extent.}"
"{The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has become the paradigm for the
evolution of cooperation among egoists. Since Axelrod's classic computer
tournaments and Nowak and Sigmund's extensive simulations of evolution,
we know that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the
Prisoner's Dilemma. According to recent developments of theory the last
champion strategy of `'win-stay, lose-shift'' (''Pavlov'') is the winner
only if the players act simultaneously, In the more natural situation of
players alternating the roles of donor and recipient a strategy of
`'Generous Tit-for-Tat'' wins computer simulations of short-term memory
strategies, We show here by experiments with humans that cooperation
dominated in both the simultaneous and the alternating Prisoner's
Dilemma. Subjects were consistent in their strategies: 30\% adopted a
Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy, whereas 70\% used a Pavlovian
strategy in both the alternating and the simultaneous game. As predicted
for unconditional strategies, Pavlovian players appeared to be more
successful in the simultaneous game whereas Generous Tit-for-Tat-like
players achieved higher payoffs in the alternating game. However, the
Pavlovian players were smarter than predicted: they suffered less from
defectors and exploited cooperators more readily, Humans appear to
cooperate either with a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy or with a
strategy that appreciates Pavlov's advantages but minimizes its
handicaps.}"

Prisoner's and Chicken Dilemma Games revealed that people cooperate less
when category information suggests that the other is competitive and
immoral rather than cooperative and honest, but not when nondiagnostic

are motivated to interpret attribute information as consistent with
their stereotype-based beliefs; dilution occurs only when it is
impossible to construe attribute information as consistent with the
stereotype. Implications to both the person perception literature and

"{Many experiments on human cooperation have revealed that individuals
differ systematically in their tendency to cooperate with others. It has
also been shown that individuals condition their behaviour on the
overall cooperation level of their peers. Yet, little is known about how
individuals respond to heterogeneity in cooperativeness in their
neighbourhood. Here, we present an experimental study investigating
whether and how people respond to heterogeneous behaviour in a public
goods game. We find that a large majority of subjects does respond to
heterogeneity in their group, but they respond in quite different ways.
Most subjects contribute less to the public good when the contributions
of their peers are more heterogeneous, but a substantial fraction of
individuals consistently contributes more in this case. In addition, we
find that individuals that respond positively to heterogeneity have a
higher general cooperation tendency. The finding that social
responsiveness occurs in different forms and is correlated with
cooperativeness may have important implications for the outcome of
cooperative interactions.}"

in the forum. In a public good game, there is no relation between
cooperation in the game and contribution to the content of the forum.
Subjects are not more altruistic with partners from the same forum but
do cooperate more with them. These results suggest that the public good
provided in Internet forums is mainly provided by a group of
unconditional altruistic users, and that the sense of belonging supports
the cooperation in that provision.}"
"{The present research investigates the role of intuitive mental
processing on cooperation in experimental games involving structural
inequality. Results from an experiment using conceptual priming to
induce intuitive mental processing provide the first evidence that
cooperation is promoted by intuition in an asymmetric context that
distributes the gains from cooperation unequally among a group.
Therefore, the results extend our understanding of the cognitive
underpinnings of human cooperation by demonstrating the robustness of
intuitive cooperation in games involving structural inequality regarding
asymmetric gains from cooperation. Additionally, the results provide the
first successful conceptual replication of the intuition-cooperation
link using conceptual priming, therefore also contributing to the debate
about the validity of previous research in other contexts. Taken
together, the present research contributes to the literature on
psychological and institutional mechanisms that promote cooperation.}"
"{Peer-punishment is effective in promoting cooperation, but the costs
associated with punishing defectors often exceed the benefits for the
group. It has been argued that centralized punishment institutions can
overcome the detrimental effects of peer-punishment. However, this
argument presupposes the existence of a legitimate authority and leaves
an unresolved gap in the transition from peer-punishment to centralized
punishment. Here we show that the origins of centralized punishment
could lie in individuals' distinct ability to punish defectors. In our
laboratory experiment, we vary the structure of the punishment situation
to disentangle the effects of punitive preferences, monetary incentives,
and individual punishment costs on the punishment of defectors. We find
that actors tacitly coordinate on the strongest group member to punish
defectors, even if the strongest individual incurs a net loss from
punishment. Such coordination leads to a more effective and more
efficient provision of a cooperative environment than we observe in
groups of all equals. Our results show that even an arbitrary assignment
of an individual to a focal position in the social hierarchy can trigger
the endogenous emergence of more centralized forms of punishment.}"
"{The most important unanswered question in evolutionary biology, and more
generally in the social sciences, is how cooperative behavior evolved.
What it takes to bring out our cooperative spirit is a scientific puzzle
that is driving basic scientific research and shaping the future of
science. By using the public goods game model, we designed four types of
experiments, namely, non-punishment (NP), free punishment (FP), cost
punishment (CP), and external punishment (EP) experiment, to test the
hypothesis that people with higher cognitive abilities have internalized
a higher tendency of cooperation. We found that people with higher
cognitive abilities are more willing to sacrifice private gain for the
public good in FP, CP, and EP experiment; They also imposed more
``pro-social punishment{''} (spending time and energy to punish unfair
actions, even though there's nothing to be gained by these actions for
themselves), and less ``antisocial punishment{''} (punishing the high
contributors as much as they punished the low contributors).}"
"{We investigate the impact of various audit schemes on the provision of
public goods, when contributing less than the average of the other group
members is centrally sanctioned and the probability of an audit is
unknown. We study how individuals update their beliefs about the
probability of being audited, both before and after audits are
permanently withdrawn. We find that when individuals have initially
experienced systematic audits, they decrease both their beliefs and
their contributions almost immediately after audits are withdrawn. In
contrast, when audits were initially less frequent and more irregular,
they maintain high beliefs and continue cooperating long after audits
have been withdrawn. This identifies the compliance effect of
irregularity and uncertainty due to learning difficulties. By increasing
both the frequency of audits and the severity of sanctions, we also
identify an educative effect of frequent and high sanctions on further
cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{The transmission of cooperative norms among individuals across
generations plays a key role in our ability to successfully manage
social-ecological systems in changing environments. Here, we use an
intergenerational public goods experiment combining both cooperative
advice and in-game communication in order to examine the transmission of
cooperative norms across generations of experimental participants. We
show that cooperative intergenerational advice has a positive impact on
both (i) contributions by individuals in a subsequent generation and
(ii) the cooperative content of communication among individuals in a
subsequent generation. The impact of cooperative intergenerational
advice is most pronounced at the beginning of the subsequent generation.
The impact of in-game communication, on the other hand, is relatively
consistent over the course of the experiment. Sessions combining advice
and communication have the highest levels of cooperation overall. Our
findings highlight the potential contributions of intergenerational
experiments to research in social-ecological systems more generally.}"
"{We explore the effects of competitive and cooperative motivations on
contributions in a field experiment. A total of 10,000 potential
political donors received solicitations referencing past contribution
behavior of members of the competing party (competition treatment), the
same party (cooperative treatment), or no past contribution information
(control). We first theoretically analyze the effect of these treatments
on the contribution behavior of agents with different social preferences
in a modified intergroup public good (IPG) game. Then, we report the
empirical results: Contribution rates in the competitive, cooperative,
and control treatments were 1.45\%, 1.08\%, and 0.78\%, respectively.
With the exception of one large contribution, the distribution of
contributions in the competitive treatment first order stochastically
dominates that of the cooperative treatment. Qualitatively, it appears
that the cooperative treatment induced more contributions around the
common monetary reference point, while the competitive treatment led to
more contributions at twice this amount. These results suggest that
eliciting competitive rather than cooperative motivations can lead to
higher contributions in IPG settings. (JEL D72, H41, C93)}"
"{Our paper investigates framing effects in a large-scale public good
experiment. We measure indicators of explanations previously proposed in
the literature, which when combined with the large sample, enable us to
estimate a structural model of framing effects. The model captures
potential causal effects and the heterogeneity of cooperation behavior.
We find that framing only has a small effect on the average level of
cooperation but a substantial effect on behavioral heterogeneity
explained almost exclusively by a corresponding change in the
heterogeneity of beliefs about Other subjects' behavior. The impact of
changes in preferences and game form misperception is on the other hand
negligible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{People on average do not play their individually rational Nash
equilibrium (NE) strategy in game experiments based on the public goods
game (PGG) that model social dilemmas. Differences from NE behavior have
also been observed in PGG experiments that include incentives to
cooperate, especially when these are peer-incentives administered by the
players themselves. In our repeated PGG experiment, an institution
rewards and punishes individuals based on their contributions. The
primary experimental result is that institutions which both reward and
punish (IRP) promote cooperation significantly better than either
institutions which only punish (IP) or which only reward (IR), and that
IP has contribution levels significantly above IR. Although comparing
their single-round NE strategies correctly predicts which incentives are
best at promoting cooperation, individuals do not play these strategies
overall. Our analysis shows that other intrinsic motivations that
combine conforming behavior with reactions to being rewarded/ punished
provide a better explanation of observed outcomes. In our experiments,
some individuals who display more cooperation than other individuals can
be regarded as the exemplars (or leaders). The role of these exemplars
in promoting cooperation provides important insights into understanding
cooperation in PGG and the effectiveness of institutional incentives at
promoting desirable societal behavior.}"
"{Theoretical investigations and quasi-experimental evidence from modern
conflict areas suggest that intergroup conflict and ostracism play a
pivotal role in the evolution of cooperation. However, there is little
direct evidence about the influence of intergroup conflict on human
social behavior in the presence of endogenous group formation and
unrestricted migration. This study introduces an experiment to examine
the impact of intergroup conflict and ostracism on group formation, and
human cooperation in a dynamic environment where group size, the
occurrence of intergroup hostility and the threat of ostracism are
endogenously determined. Here, we show that intergroup conflict may
inhibit merging into single large human coalitions. The threat of
ostracism is shown to increase the average group size and cooperation
within the society. In addition, we find that competitive pressure
between groups decreases the likelihood of social exclusion. Our results
suggest that free migration between groups suppresses the impact of
between-group competition on within-group cooperation. Moreover, our
results stress the role of ostracism as a means to repress competition
within groups and enhance group success in competition against other
groups.}"
"{Recently, researchers claimed that people are intuitively inclined to
cooperate with reflection causing them to behave selfishly. Empirical
support for this claim came from experiments using a 4-player public
goods game with a marginal return of 0.5 showing that people contributed
more money to a common project when they had to decide quickly (i.e., a
decision based on intuition) than when they were instructed to reflect
and decide slowly. This intuitive-cooperation effect is of high
scientific and practical importance because it argues against a central
assumption of traditional economic and evolutionary models. The first
experiment of present study was set up to examine the generality of the
intuitive-cooperation effect and to further validate the experimental
task producing the effect. In Experiment 1, we investigated Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers' contributions to a 4-player public goods
game with a marginal return of 0.5 while we manipulated the knowledge
about the other players' contribution to the public goods game
(contribution known vs. contribution unknown), the identity of the other
players (humans vs. computers randomly generating contributions) and the
time constraint (time pressure/intuition vs. forced delay/reflection).
However, the results of Experiment 1 failed to reveal an
intuitive-cooperation effect. Furthermore, four subsequent direct
replications attempts with AMT workers (Experiments 2a, 2b, 2c and
Experiment 3, which was conducted with naive/inexperienced participants)
also failed to demonstrate intuitive-cooperation effects. Taken
together, the results of the present study could not corroborate the
idea that people are intuitively cooperative, hence suggesting that the
theoretical relationship between intuition and cooperation should be
further scrutinized.}"
"{Cooperation is central to human societies. Yet relatively little is
known about the cognitive underpinnings of cooperative decision making.
Does cooperation require deliberate self-restraint? Or is spontaneous
prosociality reined in by calculating self-interest? Here we present a
theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation
is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of
generalized cooperative intuitions. Deliberation, by contrast, adjusts
behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation. Thus, in one-shot
anonymous interactions where selfishness is optimal, intuitive responses
tend to be more cooperative than deliberative responses. We test this
`social heuristics hypothesis' by aggregating across every cooperation
experiment using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period
(15 studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time
pressure experiment. Doing so demonstrates a positive average effect of
time pressure on cooperation. We also find substantial variation in this
effect, and show that this variation is partly explained by previous
experience with one-shot lab experiments.}"
"{Why should you help a competitor? Why should you contribute to the
public good if free riders reap the benefits of your generosity?
Cooperation in a competitive world is a conundrum. Natural selection
opposes the evolution of cooperation unless specific mechanisms are at
work. Five such mechanisms have been proposed: direct reciprocity,
indirect reciprocity, spatial selection, multilevel selection, and kin
selection. Here we discuss empirical evidence from laboratory
experiments and field studies of human interactions for each mechanism.
We also consider cooperation in one-shot, anonymous interactions for
which no mechanisms are apparent. We argue that this behavior reflects
the overgeneralization of cooperative strategies learned in the context
of direct and indirect reciprocity: we show that automatic, intuitive
responses favor cooperative strategies that reciprocate.}"
"{Based on individual variation in cooperative inclinations, we define the
``hard problem of cooperation{''} as that of achieving high levels of
cooperation in a group of non-cooperative types. Can the hard problem be
solved by institutions with monitoring and sanctions? In a laboratory
experiment we find that the answer is affirmative if the institution is
imposed on the group but negative if development of the institution is
left to the group to vote on. In the experiment, participants were
divided into groups of either cooperative types or non-cooperative types
depending on their behavior in a public goods game. In these homogeneous
groups they repeatedly played a public goods game regulated by an
institution that incorporated several of the key properties identified
by Ostrom: operational rules, monitoring, rewards, punishments, and (in
one condition) change of rules. When change of rules was not possible
and punishments were set to be high, groups of both types generally
abided by operational rules demanding high contributions to the common
good, and thereby achieved high levels of payoffs. Under less severe
rules, both types of groups did worse but non-cooperative types did
worst. Thus, non-cooperative groups profited the most from being
governed by an institution demanding high contributions and employing
high punishments. Nevertheless, in a condition where change of rules
through voting was made possible, development of the institution in this
direction was more often voted down in groups of non-cooperative types.
We discuss the relevance of the hard problem and fit our results into a
bigger picture of institutional and individual determinants of
cooperative behavior.}"
"{This paper presents the results from a series of framed field
experiments conducted in fishing communities off the Caribbean coast of
Colombia. The goal is to investigate the relative effectiveness of
exogenous regulatory pressure and pro-social emotions in promoting
cooperative behavior in a public goods context. The random public
revelation of an individual's contribution and its consequences for the
rest of the group leads to significantly higher public good
contributions and social welfare than regulatory pressure, even under
regulations that are designed to motivate fully efficient contributions.

"{Can the threat of being shamed or the prospect of being honoured lead to
greater cooperation? We test this hypothesis with anonymous six-player
public goods experiments, an experimental paradigm used to investigate
problems related to overusing common resources. We instructed the
players that the two individuals who were least generous after 10 rounds
would be exposed to the group. As the natural antithesis, we also test
the effects of honour by revealing the identities of the two players who
were most generous. The non-monetary, reputational effects induced by
shame and honour each led to approximately 50 per cent higher donations
to the public good when compared with the control, demonstrating that
both shame and honour can drive cooperation and can help alleviate the
tragedy of the commons.}"
"{Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized.
Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social
networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic,
changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This
dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that
has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical
attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those
around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present
experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and
dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize
cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale
cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial
to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research,
we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are
shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also
find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently,
cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network
connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome:
Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring.
Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links
with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to
substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the
predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and
demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in
supporting large- scale human cooperation.}"
"{We design a real-time, intercultural common pool resource experiment
using participants from cultures that derive different benefits from a
global public good (extraction vs. conservation of biodiversity
resources) to analyze the effect of group affiliation on cooperative
behavior. We also collect survey attitudes toward conservation to
augment our experimental results. We find that when participants
interact interculturally, extraction choices change significantly and
that these changes can be attributed to an amplification of the
relationship between attitudes and choices cued by the intercultural
treatment.}"

"{Context affects decision-making in many ways. In this paper we explore
differences in cooperation behaviour between communal farmers in Namibia
and South Africa, who share the same ethnic origin but have had
different historical and ecological constraints. We report on a series
of field experiments based on a common-pool resource model. Our
experimental design is framed according to the grazing situation in
semi-arid rangelands. Dependent on the behaviour in previous rounds,
participants are facing different states of resource availability with
varying need to cooperate, coordinate and to be patient. While only 4\%
of the grazing areas in South Africa remain in good quality, Namibians
achieve a level of 42\%. We analyse the different experimental states
and find that Namibians behave in all states more cooperatively. We
argue that the large difference between the two regions is due to a
combination of different historical developments and ecological
preconditions: Namibian resource users have a longer experience in
cooperative resource management and intact traditional norms. Moreover,
the real-life payoffs to cooperation are higher in Namibia stemming from
ecological factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote
cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and
collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce
individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision.
Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed
with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline
defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However,
extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in
complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for
instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the
police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and
legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the
public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single
monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the
monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we
conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers
from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the
effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal
effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to
the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our
essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by
introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies,
cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection
and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain
actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.}"
"{We test if cooperation is promoted by rank-order competition between
groups in which all groups can be ranked first, i.e. when everyone can
be a winner. This type of rank-order competition has the advantage that
it can eliminate the negative externality a group's performance imposes
on other groups. However, it has the disadvantage that incentives to
outperform others are absent, and therefore it does not eliminate
equilibria where all groups cooperate at an equal but low level. We find
that all-can-win competition produces a universal increase in
cooperation and benefits a majority of individuals if the incentive to
compete is sharp. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Why do people frequently cooperate in defiance of their immediate
incentives? One explanation is that individuals are conditionally
cooperative. As an explanation of behavior in one-shot settings, such
preferences require individuals to be able to discern their opponents'
preferences. Using data from a television game show, we provide evidence
about how individuals implement conditionally cooperative preferences.
We show that contestants forgo large sums of money to be cooperative;
they cooperate at heightened levels when their opponents are predictably
cooperative; and they fare worse when their observable characteristics
predict less cooperation because opponents avoid cooperating with them.}"
"{Reciprocal altruism, one of the most probable explanations for
cooperation among non-kin, has been modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma.
According to this game, cooperation could evolve when individuals, who
expect to play again, use conditional strategies like tit-for-tat or
Pavlov. There is evidence that humans use such strategies to achieve
mutual cooperation, but most controlled experiments with non-human
animals have failed to find cooperation. One reason for this could be
that subjects fail to cooperate because they behave as if they were to
play only once. To assess this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment
with monogamous zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that were tested in
a two-choice apparatus, with either their social partner or an
experimental opponent of the opposite sex. We found that zebra finches
maintained high levels of cooperation in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
game only when interacting with their social partner. Although other
mechanisms may have contributed to the observed difference between the
two treatments, our results support the hypothesis that animals do not
systematically give in to the short-term temptation of cheating when
long-term benefits exist. Thus, our findings contradict the commonly
accepted idea that reciprocal altruism will be rare in non-human
animals.}"

"{We study the effects of communication in an experimental tournament
between teams. When teams, rather than individuals, compete for a prize
there is a need for intra-team coordination in order to win the
inter-team competition. Introducing communication in such situations may
have ambiguous effects on effort choices. Communication within teams may
promote higher efforts by mitigating the internal free-rider problem.
Communication between competing teams may lead to collusion, thereby
reducing efforts. In our experiment we control the channels of
communication by letting subjects communicate through an electronic
chat. We find, indeed, that communication within teams increases efforts
and communication between teams reduces efforts. We use team members'
dialogs to explain these effects of communication, and check the
robustness of our results. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Globalization magnifies the problems that affect all people and that
require large-scale human cooperation, for example, the overharvesting
of natural resources and human-induced global warming. However, what
does globalization imply for the cooperation needed to address such
global social dilemmas? Two competing hypotheses are offered. One
hypothesis is that globalization prompts reactionary movements that
reinforce parochial distinctions among people. Large-scale cooperation
then focuses on favoring one's own ethnic, racial, or language group.
The alternative hypothesis suggests that globalization strengthens
cosmopolitan attitudes by weakening the relevance of ethnicity,
locality, or nationhood as sources of identification. In essence,
globalization, the increasing interconnectedness of people worldwide,
broadens the group boundaries within which individuals perceive they
belong. We test these hypotheses by measuring globalization at both the
country and individual levels and analyzing the relationship between
globalization and individual cooperation with distal others in
multilevel sequential cooperation experiments in which players can
contribute to individual, local, and/or global accounts. Our samples
were drawn from the general populations of the United States, Italy,
Russia, Argentina, South Africa, and Iran. We find that as country and
individual levels of globalization increase, so too does individual
cooperation at the global level vis-a-vis the local level. In essence,
``globalized'' individuals draw broader group boundaries than others,
eschewing parochial motivations in favor of cosmopolitan ones.
Globalization may thus be fundamental in shaping contemporary
large-scale cooperation and may be a positive force toward the provision
of global public goods.}"
"{Armies, churches, organizations, and communities often engage in
activities-for example, marching, singing, and dancing-that lead group
members to act in synchrony with each other. Anthropologists and
sociologists have speculated that rituals involving synchronous activity
may produce positive emotions that weaken the psychological boundaries
between the self and the group. This article explores whether
synchronous activity may serve as a partial solution to the free-rider
problem facing groups that need to motivate their members to contribute
toward the collective good. Across three experiments, people acting in
synchrony with others cooperated more in subsequent group economic
exercises, even in situations requiring personal sacrifice. Our results
also showed that positive emotions need not be generated for synchrony
to foster cooperation. In total, the results suggest that acting in
synchrony with others can increase cooperation by strengthening social
attachment among group members.}"

(ii) how social capital affects community resource management, and (iii)

in complex, cooperative, and competitive societies. Here, we report

"{Explaining the evolution and maintenance of cooperation among unrelated
individuals is one of the fundamental problems in biology and the social
sciences. Recent findings suggest that altruistic punishment is an
important mechanism maintaining cooperation among humans. We
experimentally explore the boundaries of altruistic punishment to
maintain cooperation by varying both the cost and the impact of
punishment, using an exceptionally extensive subject pool. Our results
show that cooperation is only maintained if conditions for altruistic
punishment are relatively favourable: low cost for the punisher and high
impact on the punished. Our results indicate that punishment is strongly
governed by its cost-to-impact ratio and that its effect on cooperation
can be pinned down to one single variable: the threshold level of
free-riding that goes unpunished. Additionally, actual pay-offs are the
lowest when altruistic punishment maintains cooperation, because the
pay-off destroyed through punishment exceeds the gains from increased
cooperation. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that
punishment decisions come from an amalgam of emotional response and
cognitive cost-impact analysis and suggest that altruistic punishment
alone can hardly maintain cooperation under multi-level natural
selection. Uncovering the workings of altruistic punishment as has been
done here is important because it helps predicting under which
conditions altruistic punishment is expected to maintain cooperation.}"
"{In this paper we study learning and cooperation in repeated prisoners'
dilemmas experiments. We compare interaction neighbourhoods of different
size and structure, we observe choices under different information
conditions, and we estimate parameters of a learning model.
We find that naive imitation, although a driving force in many models of
spatial evolution, may be negligible in the experiment. Naive imitation
predicts more cooperation in spatial structures than in spaceless
ones-regardless whether interaction neighbourhoods have the same or
different sizes in both structures. We find that with some interaction
neighbourhoods even the opposite may hold. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

"{Time-consuming and costly religious rituals pose a puzzle for economists
committed to rational choice theories of human behavior. We propose that
either through selection or a causal relationship, the performance of
religious rituals is associated with higher levels of cooperation. To
test this hypothesis we design field experiments to measure the in-group
cooperative behavior of members of religious and secular Israeli
kibbutzim, communal societies for which mutual cooperation is a matter
of survival. Our results show that religious males (the primary
practitioners of collective religious ritual in Orthodox Judaism) are
more cooperative than religious females, secular males and secular
females. Moreover, the frequency with which religious males engage in
collective religious rituals predicts well their degree of cooperative
behavior.}"
"{In an experiment, players' ability to learn to cooperate in the repeated
prisoner's dilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were
noisy, even though players could monitor one another's past actions
perfectly. In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of
opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at
which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the
robust observation from the psychology literature that partial
reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its
consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning.
This effect is magnified in the repeated game: when others are slow to
learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which
further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in
the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning,
can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there
may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful
attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned
from experience.}"

"Social dilemma situations have a particular decision structure. However, the present study shows that not only the structure but also the content or context of the situation is important. This study consisted of two parts. In one part, participants responded to 21 everyday social dilemmas by indicating how frequently they would behave cooperatively or noncooperatively. These data were factor analyzed and five factors were distinguished. For three factors the situations with high loadings had structural aspects in common and for two other factors the situations with high loadings dealt with the same content or issue. In the other part of the study, the participants made choices in an experimental social dilemma. They could contribute money to a pool and they received money (regardless of their own contribution) if the number of contributors was sufficient. The number of times the subjects made (monetary) contributions in this step-level public good dilemma correlated significantly only with the scores on the factor with situations in which money was at stake. It is argued that a classification of (daily life) social dilemmas is useful for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This exploratory study investigated the degree of correspondence between individual and group interests in the decision to adopt a sanctioning system to manage a shared resource with social dilemma properties. Fifty-two groups of four people accessed a 'free-running' computer-simulated shared resource and had either equal or unequal resource access and experienced either an equitable or inequitable sanctioning system. Consistent with past research, a worse group outcome and greater voting for system change was found under the equitable than under the inequitable sanctioning system. However, at the individual level of analysis, the results suggested that the sanctioning systems did not have the same implications for all group members and that some of those differences predicted voting for system change. The study suggests the need to investigate the various decision frames and inequitable implications associated with structural/institutional change and calls for further investigation of dependencies between micro- and macro-level units of analysis.

When a sanctioning system was already present, however, sanction support was strong and not affected by feedback. Interestingly, the presence of a sanctioning system increased pessimism about attaining collective efficiency. This suggests that the mere presence of a sanctioning system creates the need to have that sanctioning system, and that installing one can have irreversible consequences.

"A social dilemma is a situation in which the interests of the collective and its individual members clash. In these situations individuals typically are tempted to take actions that favor (sometimes even maximize) their short-term egocentric interests. However, if all group members adopt such behaviors, the group suffers since all its members are worse off than they could be by endorsing alternative prosocial actions that favor (sometimes even maximize) the collective interest. This book provides an overview and summary of the state of social psychological research on social dilemmas. It is organized around four core issues: individual differences, which determine people's preferences for outcomes that promote either their own or their group's well-being; the study of dynamic processes based on simulations of artificial societies; social dilemmas that emerge in intergroup conflicts; and the effect of various types and sources of uncertainty on behavior in social dilemma situations.

"This paper investigated the impact of leadership style on the stability of small social dilemma groups. In two experiments, group members were more likely to exit their group and take their resources elsewhere if they were supervised by an autocratic style leader than by a democratic or laissez-faire style leader. The destabilizing influence of autocratic leadership is due to the procedural rather than distributive aspects of this leadership style: More members exited their group under an autocratic style leader, relative to a democratic style leader, regardless of whether or not they received favorable personal outcomes from the leader. Hence, autocratic leadership is not a stable long-term solution to the problem of public goods in groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A robust finding in social dilemma research is an increase in individual cooperative choice following group discussion about the dilemma. To elaborate the idea that this effect arises from the development of within-group consensus, groups of six made explicit group decisions about their subsequent individual choice. Perceived demonstrability of cooperativeness in the dilemma was manipulated through changes both to instructions and the incentives of the dilemma. As demonstrability decreased, so did the proportion of groups deciding to cooperate, leading to a reduction in the group discussion effect. Social decision scheme analysis supported the demonstrability-group decision hypothesis. The interaction between demonstrability, individual opinions and group process is proposed to explain the group discussion effect. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Social dilemmas arise when group members experience a clash between their personal interests and the interests of the group to which they belong. Dawes (1980) specifies two necessary conditions for the occurrence of such conflicts: (a) The payoff to each individual for acting in self-interest (called defecting) is higher than the payoff for acting in the interest of the collective (called cooperating) regardless of what the others do, but (b) all individuals receive a lower payoff if all defect rather than cooperate. Two examples of social dilemmas are the public good dilemma and the resource dilemma. How do people act and what are the key elements and factors that affect human behavior in these dilemmas? In this chapter we focus on the uncertainties individual decision makers face in social dilemmas and on the way they react to such uncertainties. Our aim is twofold. First we will present a brief review on what is known about uncertainty effects in social dilemmas. The second aim is to identify what is not known about uncertainty effects in the social dilemma. We will argue that the research in this area has overlooked some important types of information, and we make a case for broadening the scope of research on the effects of uncertainty on behavior in social dilemmas.

"Cooperation to produce collective goods is widespread in society, and yet so is its failure. Theorists have identified competing mechanisms for facilitating group cooperation, including group identity, sanctions and reciprocity. Here I use empirical data to explore how these mechanisms influence cooperation in the natural laboratory of microcredit borrowing groups. Microcredit makes loans to high-risk borrowers through borrowing groups in which individuals' access to credit is dependent on the behavior of other members of the group, thereby creating a social dilemma for members and an opportunity to observe cooperation in real world groups. By analyzing both collective goods production (loans) and compliance (repayment), I find that the competing mechanisms have differential effects. Group identity, sanctions and reciprocity are all associated with more borrowing in the group. Only reciprocity, however, limits loan delinquency and is associated with group longevity, suggesting both that collective goods production is a distinct process from group compliance over time, and that reciprocity may be an important mechanism in both processes. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of group cooperation, as well as the implications for the related theoretical concept of embeddedness.

"This article extends Simpson's (2003) research on sex differences in social dilemmas. To test the hypotheses that men defect in response to greed and women to fear, Simpson created Fear and Greed Dilemmas, but experiments using these games supported the greed hypothesis only. In this article I focus on why the fear hypothesis failed and suggest that fear was actually absent in the Fear Dilemma. To retest Simpson's hypotheses, I propose a new asymmetric game, the Fear-of-Greed Dilemma. The asymmetry is important for two reasons. First, it creates the risk of exploitation that Simpsons Fear Dilemma lacked. Second, it exposes a critical limitation in Rapoport's (1964) K-index and suggests a re-specification. Laboratory studies supported the fear hypothesis and found mediating effects of expectations about partners on sex differences in cooperation.

"Interactions in social life may be seriously affected by negative noise, whereby actual or perceived behavior is less cooperative than was intended (e.g., arriving late due to an unforeseen traffic jam). The present research examines whether negative noise exerts detrimental effects on impressions and cooperation and whether such effects could be reduced by communication. Consistent with hypotheses, Study 1 revealed that negative noise exerts detrimental effects on both impressions of partners' benign intent and cooperation and that these detrimental effects could be effectively reduced by communication about noise. Study 2 replicated both findings but only for individuals with low trust. Mediation analysis revealed that impressions of benign intent and prosocial interaction goals underlie the positive effects of communication on cooperation.

"Recently economists have become interested in why people who face social dilemmas in the experimental lab use the seemingly incredible threat of punishment to deter free riding. Three theories with evolutionary microfoundations have been developed to explain punishment. We survey these theories and use behavioral data from surveys and experiments to show that the theory called social reciprocity in which people punish norm violators indiscriminately explains punishment best.

"Decentralized groups such as close knit residential neighborhoods and ethnically linked businesses often achieve high levels of cooperation while engaging in exclusionary practices that we call parochialism. We investigate the contribution of within-group cultural affinity to the ability of parochial groups to cooperate in social dilemmas. We analyze parochial networks in which the losses incurred by not trading with outsiders are offset by an enhanced ability to enforce informal contracts by fostering trust among insiders. We show that there is a range of degrees of parochialism for which parochial networks can coexist with an anonymous market offering unrestricted trading opportunities.

"The present study examined whether a temporary activation of independent or interdependent self-construals by priming has an influence on cooperation in social dilemmas. It was expected that individuals primed with independence would be primarily concerned with their own outcomes, whereas individuals primed with interdependence would also be concerned with the outcomes of their interaction partner. The former should therefore exhibit lower levels of cooperation. Additionally, the influence of social value orientation on cooperation was measured. Participants played 32 rounds of a give-some dilemma with an alleged interaction partner. As predicted, participants primed with independence exhibited lower levels of cooperation than participants primed with interdependence. Results are discussed in terms of their significance for research on self-construals and social dilemmas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A recurrent finding in studies that have systematically varied resource uncertainty is that increasing uncertainty leads to overharvesting or underprovision (Garling et al., 1999). In this chapter we first briefly review previous research with the aim of understanding the reasons for these results. An important issue is how the demonstrated negative effects can be counteracted. We therefore ask whether effective debiasing procedures are available. In particular we emphasize one problem, perhaps unique to these kinds of resource-management problems where there is interdependence between the actors. If somebody knows that he or she knows more than the others, that is, if there is asymmetrical access to information about the resource, why should this person share his or her knowledge rather than using it to exploit others? Given that everyone knows that this may be the case, why should one ever trust information somebody else provides? Since there seldom may be any alternative ways of obtaining knowledge, debiasing is perhaps futile. We will report new experiments that we have carried out, whose messages are more optimistic. We will also analyze important principal-agent problems in the society where asymmetric access to information is a ubiquitous property. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Various theories have been shown to account for the effects of procedural fairness on people's attitudes and behaviors. We propose that a logical next step for organizational justice researchers is to delineate not whether, but rather when certain explanations are likely to account for people's reactions to procedural fairness information. Accordingly, the present research tested the hypothesis that social psychological explanations would be particularly applicable to people high in interdependent self-construal. As predicted, the results of three studies showed that interdependent self-construal (ISC) moderated the relationship between procedural fairness and a variety of dependent variables (cooperation, positive affect, and desire for future interaction with the other party). In different types of interpersonal encounters (social dilemmas, reward allocations, and negotiations), procedural fairness had more of an influence on participants' reactions among those high rather than low in ISC. Theoretical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This dissertation proposed a model relating culture to self-interested behavior in resource negotiations. Participants from four economic regions-North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-made resource allocation decisions prior to a discussion in culturally mixed groups. Cultural differences were confirmed along two cultural values that shape implicit theories invoked in negotiations, self-direction and hierarchy. Results, based on an experimental commons dilemma simulation, supported a contextual model in which culture interacts with economic power asymmetry. Decision-makers from groups that scored high on the cultural value of hierarchy reacted to economic power cues, whereas, those low on hierarchy did not. Decision-makers from hierarchical groups that also scored high on the cultural value of self-direction were more self-interested in positions of high economic power, and relatively less so in positions of low economic power, suggesting they applied an equity norm. In contrast, decision-makers from groups high on hierarchy and low on self-direction were less self-interested and more socially responsible (cooperative) in positions of high economic power, suggesting they applied an inverse equity norm. Results also indicated that the interaction effect of cultural profile and economic power on self-interested behavior was fully mediated by social motives, egocentrism, and expectations. Implications for the impact of culture on social dilemmas are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Knowledge exchange with shared databases can be seen as a public-goods dilemma. People are reluctant to contribute information because they save time, effort and perhaps social power if they withhold their knowledge and socially loaf. But if all people choose this individually efficient strategy, then no information exchange can take place, and the group is less effective than it would have been if all members contributed. Thus, in the knowledge-exchange situation, group norms and individual norms oppose each other. In order to strengthen people's orientation towards the group, virtual collaborative tools sometimes provide member portraits. But based on the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effect (SIDE)-Model, ambivalent effects of these member portraits are expected according to people's social categorization: when people identify more strongly with the group, such portraits enhance participation, whereas when people have a stronger individual identity, they undermine participation. This study links the concepts of social value orientation to identity salience. The assumption is that in the information-exchange dilemma, the social value orientation of a group member will determine whether group identity or individual identity becomes salient for that group member. We then extend the SIDE-model to the domain of social loafing and expect that portraits of the group members will have different effects for people with individual orientation and for people with prosocial orientation. An experiment confirmed this expectation and revealed a significant interaction between social value orientation and portraits. Especially striking is the result that for prosocials the provision of member portraits leads to an increase in social loafing. This is analogous to the predictions of the SIDE-model.

"Examined the effects of environmental uncertainty (low, high uncertainty about the provision point) and social uncertainty (low, high uncertainty about others' cooperation) in a public goods dilemma. Participants were 108 volunteers aged 16+ yrs. In line with social comparison theory, it was predicted and found that environmental uncertainty decreases cooperation only under high social uncertainty, but not under low social uncertainty. The detrimental effects of environmental uncertainty can be counteracted by uncertainty reducing information on the provision point and/or on others' contributions as well.

"Examined factors affecting cooperation in public goods settings involving relatively small groups. The gender composition of the group and the history of the group's level of cooperation were investigated among 254 undergraduates. Ss were told that they were interacting with 3 other people via computer and that everyone in the group was making similar investment decisions. Ss worked through investment problems and received feedback indicating their group was cooperative or uncooperative. Three game-theoretical predictions are posited. Using expectation states theory and social identity theory, 2 sets of hypotheses regarding gender identity are offered. A 3  2 experimental design tested the predictions; the factors are gender composition of the groups and others' behavior. All game theory predictions are supported. For the public goods setting examined, expectation states theories provide more accurate models of group members' behavior than social identity theories.

"Conducted 3 experiments to examine the predictions of prospect theory, specifically that settings involving common pool resources would generate higher levels of cooperation than settings involving public goods when the payoffs are the same. Results showed that common pool resources generated higher levels of cooperation on 1st trials in both static and dynamic contexts. If no interaction with other group members was added, the higher levels of cooperation in resource settings remained in static settings. In dynamic settings, however, where the resource itself changed, the higher levels of cooperation in resource settings were short-lived. In both dynamic and static settings, the addition of group interaction seemed to eliminate the initial differences in levels of cooperation.

"Research in group decision making has long been divided along the lines of categorical, e.g., a guilty versus not-guilty verdict as in a criminal trial, versus continuous decisions, e.g., a monetary budget allocation. The possibility that groups may share the same processes when making these two types of decisions was studied by contrasting groups that made a natural categorical decision (a categorical elicitation mode) with groups that first decided on a numerical value on a corresponding continuous scale, and then derived a categorical choice based on that continuous judgment (a continuous elicitation mode). This elicitation mode difference was examined in a sequential step-level public good social dilemma with a variable provision point. It was found that groups in both elicitation mode conditions followed a similar simple-majority process in making the group decisions. Computer simulations further suggested that group decisions made in the categorical elicitation mode would be more extreme than those in the continuous elicitation mode. A practical implication is that by strategic maneuver (or happenstance) a particular elicitation mode could be adopted, and the group decision could be steered one way or the other. The social dilemma context of the experiment provided the additional opportunity to study the effects of provision point uncertainty on public good provision. Computer simulations based on individuals' contribution decisions found that a fixed provision point would provide a public good more often than would a variable provision point. Although a provision point is often an uncertain forecast and is seldom an exact value, the simulation results suggested that a provision point should be specified as an exact value despite its inherent variability in order to ensure a high public good provision rate.

"The traditional solution concept for noncooperative game theory is the Nash equilibrium, which contains an implicit assumption that players' probability distributions satisfy probabilistic independence. However, in games with more than two players, relaxing this assumption results in a more general equilibrium concept based on joint beliefs (P. Vanderschraaf, 1995). This article explores the implications of this joint-beliefs equilibrium concept for two kinds of conflictual coordination games: crisis bargaining and public goods provision. We find that, using updating consistent with Bayes' rule, players' beliefs converge to equilibria in joint beliefs which do not satisfy probabilistic independence. In addition, joint beliefs greatly expand the set of mixed equilibria. On the face of it, allowing for joint beliefs might be expected to increase the prospects for coordination. However, we show that if players use joint beliefs, which may be more likely as the number of players increases, then the prospects for coordination in these games declines vis-à-vis independent beliefs.

"Employed 3 types of social dilemma games (the Prisoner's Dilemma [PD], the Chicken Dilemma [CD], and the Trust Dilemma [TD]) with 116 male and 10 female undergraduates. Ss, who were classified as either cooperators or defectors, participated in one of the games before and after they received bogus feedback in which they were told that the majority had chosen the defecting alternative (DALT) or that the majority had chosen the cooperative alternative (CALT). Results confirm all 3 hypotheses in that (1) both before and after feedback, defectors made more defecting choices than did cooperators; (2) before and after feedback, more defecting choices were made in the PD than in the CD and in the CD than in the TD; and (3) more defecting choices were made after majority DALT feedback than after majority CALT feedback. Findings also indicate that defectors were especially sensitive to majority DALT feedback in the PD and the TD in that it facilitated their natural inclination to prefer DALT choices. No support for H. H. Kelley and A. J. Stahelski's (see record [rid]1971-02325-001[/rid]) triangle hypothesis was observed. (51 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Tested 3 distinct theoretical models relating player's attitudes toward a confederate in the Prisoner's Dilemma game: reinforcing outcome, cultural norm, and social comparison. 48 male and 48 female undergraduate Ss played 100 trials of the Prisoner's Dilemma game with a confederate, who played either a 74% cooperative or 74% competitive predetermined strategy. Ss then filled out the Interpersonal Judgment Scale rating the confederate. Behaviorally similar confederates received more positive evaluations than dissimilar confederates, supporting the social comparison hypothesis. Further, the strategy of the confederate did not influence choice behavior in mixed-sex dyads, suggesting that sex roles may inhibit behaviorally based male–female interaction. The generality of gaming research that has dealt almost exclusively with same-sex dyads is questioned. (46 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Investigated the cooperation in 6 pairs of female albino rats in the prisoner's dilemma game. Ss were taught to make either cooperative or uncooperative responses by running to one or the other end of a T-maze. Two T-mazes were joined together so that Ss could respond simultaneously. Three training procedures were used for each S: maze familiarization, matrix training, and cooperation testing. Ss were run under conditions in which visual communication was present and absent. Mutually uncooperative responses were the most common, and mutually cooperative behaviors were the least preferred. Introduction of a barrier between the mazes, which removed visual communication between pairs, sharply accentuated uncooperative behavior. Data indicate that Ss quickly began responding appropriately according to the payoffs involved. Similarities of the present findings to results with human Ss and the implications of using game theory for studying cooperative behavior in animals are discussed.

Each S was asked to indicate his/her choice as an initial move ahead of and after being informed of the hypothetical opponent's move.

"The moral acts of 19 dyads of 4-yr-olds in a cognitively simplified version of Prisoner's Dilemma game were analyzed in relationship to their friendship, emotions, and processes of conflict resolution. Degree of friendship was rated by teachers; 2 sociologists used a Q-sort of group processes to describe the dyads' interactions. The emotions of each S were coded from videotape independently of his/her partner's and with the sound turned off. Moral acts were categorically identified as equalization, reparation, stalemate, default, and betrayal. These acts were also assigned scale scores on a dimension of moral sensitivity that was independently derived from separate work with 143 undergraduates, who judged the 5 acts in all possible paired comparisons and then rated the moral difference between each pair. These data almost perfectly fitted a model of increasing monotonic function. The degree of friendship between the dyads and their interactive processes—group orientation, positive emotional tone, and active involvement—were positively related to sensitive moral action. Their emotions were related to concurrent acts, and more importantly, predicted their subsequent acts even though they seldom talked about morality. Results suggest that if social scientists' search for practical morality is to be successful, emotional communication needs to be considered.

"A theory developed to account for behavior in social dilemmas—situations in which the rational pursuit of self-interest can lead to collective disaster—was applied to the analysis of group motivation losses. Two group motivation loss effects demonstrated in previous research, the social-loafing effect and the free-rider effect, are shown to follow from social dilemma theories. An experiment with 75 undergraduates was performed to empirically demonstrate a 3rd motivation loss effect, termed the 'sucker' effect. It was hypothesized that group members would reduce their efforts if they had a capable partner who free-rode on their efforts, that is, who was capable of contributing to the group but would not. This prediction was confirmed. The effect was particularly strong in males. Potential remedies for such motivation losses are discussed.

"Explored the effect of legitimation of power on subsequent behavior of group members. 120 adult Ss worked in groups of 4, in which 1 group member—the powerholder—was able to take 3 times as many outcomes as the average group member. In half of the groups, this ability of the powerholder was acquired by previous effort expenditure (the merit condition); in the other half of the groups, the power was usurped (the usurpation condition). M. Mulder's (1972) power theory predicts that difference in quality of power has no effect. Insights derived from social justice literature by W. Austin and E. Hatfield (1980) suggest that when the powerholder takes more than the average fellow group member—this being so in the so-called proportional outcomes condition—then the proportionality standard of justice will be introduced. Data support Mulder's quality of power hypothesis. However, a legitimate powerholder later received more social support than a usurper. The standard of justice hypothesis by Austin and Hatfield was sustained, since regular group members in the proportional outcomes condition took fewer outcomes than those in the equal outcomes condition.

"Investigated the influence of the Type A behavior pattern on attribution processes using 48 male undergraduates. It was predicted that Type A Ss would be more motivated to succeed in the Prisoner's Dilemma game than would Type B's. Increased motivation to succeed was predicted to lead Type A's to exaggerate the amount of dispositional information they would believe they had inferred from observing the behavior of a future opponent, since such a belief would lead to increased confidence about predicting the target's behavior and thus increase Ss' perceived control over the outcome. Results support the predictions when the hard-driving competitiveness dimension of the Type A pattern was used as the individual difference variable. Moreover, evaluations of future opponents in the Prisoner's Dilemma game also differed as a function of the hard-driving competitive dimension. Results are discussed in terms of a person by situation interactive model of motivational influences on attribution processes and in terms of potential interpersonal effects of the cognitive behavior of Type A individuals.

"100 undergraduates were selected as Ss on the basis of their scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, a short form of the MMPI, and the Fear Survey Schedule. Three groups of Ss (depressed, nondepressed/other psychological problems, and normal) interacted with a same-sex normal person in a modified Prisoner's Dilemma procedure in which each player's relative power was manipulated. Dyads also had several opportunities to exchange communications during the game. Results indicate that when depressed Ss were in the high-power role, the interactive pattern in the Prisoner's Dilemma procedure was relatively exploitive and noncooperative. High-power depressed Ss also displayed elevation in communications of self-devaluation/sadness and helplessness. This array of behaviors elicited noncooperativeness, extrapunitiveness, and expressions of helplessness in their normal partners. Depressives in the low-power role exhibited no unique game behaviors but communicated self-devaluation and helpless messages; and in addition, they tended to blame their partner for their devalued condition—a pattern that elicited more ingratiating behaviors in their normal partners.

"Investigated attribution processes of 56 college students in a cooperation–noncooperation modified prisoner's dilemma game. These processes of the Ss were explored in a 2 × 2 factorial design (S's high or low cooperation and target's high or low cooperation). Results show that Ss attributed the target's high cooperation significantly less to an internal cause when the S's own cooperation was high than when it was low. There was no significant difference in the S's ratings of the internal attribution for the target's low cooperation between the S's cooperation conditions. When Ss attributed less to the internal cause, they had a tendency to attribute the cooperation to their own cooperation. Results confirm that an active observer in a social interaction perceives the causes of another person's behavior as dependent on the observer's own behavior toward the other.

Attributions were assessed by having Ss rate each of 4 responses representative of the social motives of cooperation, competition, apathy, and deceit in 5 situations. It was found that the type of account had specific attributional effects. A cooperative account led to a correspondent inference of a cooperative disposition, a transrelational equity account was apparently preceived as illegitimate and led to an attribution of a deceitful motive, and an excuse of ignorance was linked with apathy.

Results indicate that there was a tendency for the group-representative (GRC) and GAC to be more competitive than the individuals condition and IC, that the GRC was more competitive than the GAC, and that the IC and individuals condition did not differ. The difference between the GRC and GAC is interpreted as consistent with a prediction that intergroup contact can reduce competitiveness even when there is conflict and the absence of norms requiring cooperative behavior.

"Compared the opening general announcement and the specific announcements of each act (components of the graduated and reciprocated initiative in tension-reduction [GRIT] strategy). 100 female undergraduates played a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game. In Exp I, the presence or absence of an opening general announcement of intention was crossed, in a 2 by 2 design, with the presence or absence of specific announcements of individual acts. Results indicate that the general announcement was both necessary and sufficient, whereas the specific messages were ineffective. Results of Exp II indicate that Ss responded more cooperatively to the conciliatory initiatives of the simulated other when the general announcement included an invitation to work together toward a common object.

"In two studies, we examined the effects of repeating and rephrasing a statement of intent to act cooperatively in an interdependent relationship. In the first, 128 subjects in a Prisoner's Dilemma interaction opposed a simulated other who followed a constant pattern of choices from trial to trial but used one of four forms of communication of strategic intent: one general conciliatory statement, three statements involving rephrasing, three statements showing annoyance after the first, and no-communication control. All communication treatments prompted a more cooperative response than did the control; the rephrasing treatment was significantly more effective than the single statement. In the second study, 57 subjects were placed in either the standard statement condition or in a slightly revised rephrasing condition. Again, the response to rephrasing enhanced liking for the communicator and perceived trustworthiness and credibility. Rephrasing also made subjects alter their objective; they felt it less appropriate to try to gain more than the other person than did the subjects in the single-statement condition.

"Examines conflict spirals, triggered by the use of threats and punishments in conflict settings. A conceptual framework borrowed from A. W. Gouldner (1960) suggests that spirals involve 2 types of comparisons, qualitative and quantitative. Research exists to indicate that spirals will involve an exchange of qualitatively similar rather than dissimilar tactics, as well as a pattern of rough, rather than exact, quantitative matching. In order to examine these patterns in threat settings, 80 female undergraduates were used in a split-plot factorial design that manipulated a confederate bargainer's use of frequent vs infrequent threats, large vs small threats, and large vs small punishments in a prisoner's dilemma game (with trials as a repeated factor). Results indicate that retaliatory exchanges did develop and can be systematically described along quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Results suggest that spirals do involve the expected patterns of matching. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Cooperation in organisms, whether bacteria or primates, has been a difficulty for evolutionary theory since Darwin. On the assumption that interactions between pairs of individuals occur on a probabilistic basis, a model is developed based on the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Deductions from the model, and the results of a computer tournament show how cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in an asocial world, can thrive while interacting with a wide range of other strategies, and can resist invasion once fully established. Potential applications include specific aspects of territoriality, mating, and disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In 2 studies, 200 undergraduates played repeated trials of Prisoner's Dilemma game with a simulated other who could send verbal communications. In the 1st study, the other began intensifying conflict by being behaviorally unresponsive over a long duration, by being totally noncooperative, by responding more quickly to the competition than the cooperation of the S, or by coercing cooperation with threats for the purpose of exploitation. Then the other introduced a program of carefully communicated conciliation. Results show a significant increase in cooperation by the Ss across conditions. In the 2nd study, Ss' competition was intensified by the other's choice of verbal communication (threat, insult, or challenge). When the other introduced conciliation, Ss responded cooperatively in all cases. When the other lapsed into uncommunicated competition, Ss became highly competitive once more. Findings are discussed in terms of M. Deutsch's (see record [rid]1984-09390-001[/rid]) crude law of social relations and the evidence suggesting that an atmosphere of either cooperation or competition can be quickly altered in a situation of interdependence when 1 party clearly acts inconsistently with what is characteristic of that climate.

"A total of 48 Ss (24 female and 24 male) participated in 30 trials of a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a simulated other who was 50% cooperative in the 1st block of 10 trials and 100% cooperative in the 3rd block. Following Trial 10, the other sent 1 of 2 handwritten notes to the S, or, in Condition 3, sent none. One of the notes said, in effect, 'If you cooperate, I will,' (the IFU note), while the other said, 'I will cooperate; it's what we have to do to get our most points,' (the GRIT note). As hypothesized, the GRIT approach elicited more cooperation by the S than the IFU approach, particularly in the 3rd block where the other was consistently cooperative and most vulnerable. Both notes positively influenced cooperation in comparison with the no-note condition. Results are discussed in terms of the perceptions of intentions created by the 2 notes and the GRIT proposal in general. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A 60-trial iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game was played by 24 male undergraduates. Half were abstract information processors, and half were concrete information processors. In addition, half of the S pairs played the game face-to-face, while in the other pairs the game was played in separate cubicles. Rather than allowing for free play, Ss were given the illusion of playing against one another when in reality they all played against a simulation program. Concrete Ss cooperated most in the presence of another player, and competed most when not facing him. This was apparently due to the tendency for the concrete players to be 'caught' by the cooperative pull of the face-to-face condition. Abstract Ss tended to use information-seeking strategies in both conditions. When the information was irrelevant to the game, abstract players did not maximize to the same degree as when the feedback was more meaningful.

"96 undergraduates played Prisoner's Dilemma in which their power to control outcomes was less than, equal to, or greater than that of a simulated other (SO). After 10 trials on which (s)he was 50% competitive, the SO either did or did not send a note of intent to be cooperative. In the 2nd block of 10 trials, the SO either was 100% cooperative or began with cooperation and stayed with it if S did not exploit. When S did exploit, SO made the competitive choice on the following trial (retaliation) followed by a return to cooperation on the next trial. In a 3rd block, SO was 100% cooperative in all conditions. Ss whose power was equal to or less than that of the SO were more cooperative in response to conciliation than Ss whose power was greater. Ss in the equal or low power conditions who received the note of intent were more cooperative than those who did not. Ss in the equal power condition who experienced retaliation were more cooperative than those who did not. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

"112 undergraduates acted in a social dilemma situation in which 2 variables—use and variance—were experimentally manipulated. One-third of the Ss thought that the others in their group were overusing the common resource, one-third of the Ss thought that the others were underusing it, and the remaining one-third were led to believe that the others were using the resource optimally. Half of the Ss were also led to believe that the others took relatively similar harvests (low variance), while the other half thought the others differed greatly (high variance). Results indicate that more Ss in the overuse condition voted to give up free access to the resource and to hand over the management of the resource to a leader than in the other use conditions. More Ss in the high-variance condition voted for a leader than in the low-variance condition. Over all conditions, Ss preferred themselves most as prospective leader. Findings suggest that if a leaderless group does not efficiently deal with its external environment, resulting in the depletion of a common resource, a strong need for a leader will arise.

"Previous research with social dilemma games has provided 2 choices, cooperative and competitive, and results have shown that most Ss attempt to maximize selfish interests (respond competitively), resulting in an outcome that is detrimental to collective welfare. This study assessed the extent to which the introduction of an alternative (compromise) choice would facilitate cooperative behavior. Two experiments were conducted using 3-person groups of undergraduate males as Ss (N = 145). Exp I contrasted cooperative choices in a 2- vs a 3-choice game; results show significantly greater cooperation in the 3-choice game. Exp II contrasted different types of compromise choices in a 3-choice game; results indicate significantly different response proportions in these games.

"Tested the impact of asymmetric role relationships (in which some group members contribute more to the group's welfare than others) on behavior in a social dilemma setting by manipulating the sex composition of cooperative performance dyads, using 47 male and 48 female undergraduates. The prescriptions of traditional sex roles suggested that Ss of both sexes would defect more (i.e., work less hard) with a male partner than with a female partner, both when the partner presented an opportunity to free ride and when the partner appeared to be free-riding on the S's efforts. Results confirm this prediction. Male Ss were less willing to free ride when the partner was female than male, while females were more willing to free ride on their male partner than on their female partner. In the sucker condition, both males and females seemed to balk more at the prospect of carrying a male free rider than a female free rider. Further analyses suggested that the effects should not be attributed to perceived sex differences in task ability. Plausible alternatives are discussed, including the possibility that interaction with women, per se, encourages greater effort, regardless of whether roles prescribe differential effort for the task.

"Used an apex game in an experiment designed to demonstrate the differential impact of rewards and punishments as selective incentives on collective action in a power-based bargaining game. Apex games place weak players in the formal equivalent of a multiperson prisoner's dilemma in which each weak player must choose between competing against the other weak players for the opportunity to coalesce with the strong player or cooperating with the other weak players to produce a jointly preferable outcome. Punishments, not rewards, were predicted to be effective for enforcing cooperation by the weak players. 54 groups of 4 Ss each played the weak role in a 5-person apex game with a confederate playing the apex (strong) role in a 3 × 3 design with factors of low, medium, and high levels of rewards and punishments available as incentives. As predicted, punishments but not rewards had a significant impact on increasing cooperation. Despite this effect, many groups experienced harmful effects of punishment availability that increased the risk of retaliatory spirals. It is concluded that a 2nd-order dilemma may be seen in prisoner's dilemmas, since punishments are both necessary for enforcing cooperation and detrimental to that cooperation.

"As previous research on bargaining and allocation behavior has emphasized the positive nature of joint outcomes, the question is raised about the extent to which decisions for allocation procedures differ when joint outcomes are negative instead of positive. Although prominent theories of allocation behavior do not differentiate between allocation strategies in the case of jointly produced gains and losses, it is reasoned that losses may stimulate preferences for a formal allocation strategy (i.e., through judicial court) as compared to preferences for an informal allocation strategy (negotiating for the allocation device) in the case of gains. Results of a questionnaire study in which 321 undergraduates were led to make decisions in a Prisoner's Dilemma-like payoff situation support this hypothesis. Ss more frequently preferred an allocation clarified by court when losses occurred as a consequence of joint activities than when gains occurred. Implications are discussed with regard to perceptions of the payoff situation and the social context within which the procedural decisions were supposed to be made.

"To investigate the factorial dimensions among achievement-related motives (motive to avoid success) and to provide information about the relation of the motive to avoid success to cooperative action, 62 male and 62 female Japanese undergraduates were administered the ARM (Achievement Related Motives) Scale. Four factors were extracted by the principal-factor analysis from the correlation matrix, and the factors were rotated by a normalized varimax criterion. Two of these factors contained the motive to avoid success. Four factor scores were computed for each S using the varimax factor weights obtained in the factor analysis. Sex differences in each factor score were not significant. The number of cooperative actions on the Prisoner's Dilemma game was defined as a score of cooperative tendency. Sex differences in the mean cooperative score were not significant. It is interesting to note, however, that the relationships between the denying attitude for attaining success and the cooperative tendency were significant for females but not for males.

"Investigated the hypothesis that cooperation may occur as a result of strategic self-presentation that is instrumental for increasing personal gain. 149 undergraduates played a decomposed Prisoner's Dilemma game with a bogus partner. The prospect of future interaction with the partner and the discernment of the partner (i.e., contingency in giving approval) were manipulated, and Ss were classified as scoring high or low on a self-monitoring scale. It was hypothesized that high self-monitors would exhibit more variability in cooperative behavior across social contexts and would be more cooperative with discerning partners and partners with whom they anticipated future interaction than would low self-monitors. As predicted, the prospect of future interaction with a partner increased the cooperation of the high, but not the low, self-monitors. Cooperation was not related to attraction for the partner (Interpersonal Judgment Scale) for either high or low self-monitors. Correlates of self-monitoring did not predict cooperation. Results are discussed in terms of individual differences in motives for cooperation and strategic self-presentation. (40 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Tested the hypothesis that future dependence produces more helping behavior between people who like one another than between people who dislike one another. This hypothesis was derived from the goal/expectation theory of D. G. Pruitt and M. J. Kimmel (see record [rid]1977-28619-001[/rid]), a theory developed to interpret certain findings about cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. In an experiment with 60 female undergraduates, the hypothesis was supported. For Ss who liked one another, future dependence led to more time spent helping and a greater amount of help than no future dependence. For Ss who disliked one another, helping was low regardless of the extent of future dependence. The amount of help given the other increased across trials only for those Ss who were dependent on the other for later help. The Pruitt and Kimmel theory explains the low level of helping in the conditions where the other was disliked as due to a lack of trust that the other would reciprocate.

"Tested the hypothesis that when situational cues are ambiguous, Ss will rely heavily on 1st impressions of strangers. 80 male undergraduates participated in a message-modified prisoner's dilemma game, in which the 1st impressions of a source of noncontingent promises (each S's imaginary partner) were manipulated to be either good–impotent (harmless) or bad–potent (harmful). The source was either 100 or 0% reliable in fulfilling his promises, and the instructions were either individualistic or competitive. Results show that initial trust by Ss was affected by both 1st impressions and the source's reliability. However, Ss displayed the most overall trust when they perceived the promiser as good and impotent. On nonmessage trials, Ss were more cooperative when a good–impotent impression conflicted with competitive instructions. Overall, when Ss had blatant contradictory information they discounted all but their impressions of their opponent, but when cues were consistent with one another, Ss based their nonmessage trial responses on some algebraic summing of the information available to them.

"Two experiments, with 154 female and 150 male undergraduates, tested the hypothesis that groups are more competitive than individuals and investigated the nature of the difference. In Exp I, 2 same-sex individuals or 2 same-sex dyads played 10 trials of a prisoner's dilemma matrix game (PDG) for money. Play between individuals was more cooperative and less competitive than play between groups. In Exp II, Ss played 10 trials of either PDG or mutual-fate-control (MFC) matrices. For the MFC matrix, the competitive choice, which reduces the opponent's outcomes but has no effect on one's own outcomes, reflects a desire to increase one's relative advantage over the opponent. Although cooperation was greater for MFC, for both PDG and MFC matrices groups were more competitive and less cooperative than individuals. A large component of the groups–individuals effect was attributed to the greater desire of groups to win or avoid losing to the opponent, regardless of absolute outcomes.

"Assessed the effect of interpersonal betrayal and cooperative social interaction on self-evaluation processes among 54 female undergraduates scored as depressed or nondepressed on the Self-Rating Depression Scale. Depressed Ss who experienced interpersonal betrayal in a prisoner's dilemma game were more critical of their performance on a subsequent task than were nondepressed Ss or depressed Ss who had experienced a cooperative interaction. Depressed Ss in the betrayal condition also behaved more aggressively toward their betraying partner than did nondepressed betrayed Ss. Depressed Ss were more critical of their own personality characteristics than were nondepressed Ss, regardless of condition. Results suggest that some negative cognitive schema among depressed persons may be altered by interpersonal factors, although it is not clear whether such effects are secondary to increases in self-criticism after conflict or to decreases in self-critical tendencies after positive interaction. Researchers are urged to use multiple, diverse measures of self-evaluation in future efforts to study variability in self-appraisal.

"Examined cases of moral conflict among 80 1st-yr undergraduates divided into 10 friendship groups composed of 8 individuals who were administered an adaptation of the prisoner's dilemma game, which involved a choice of 4 possible game options that ranged between an extreme of cooperation and an extreme of competition. Results reveal the emergence of a moral conflict occurring between teams during a crucial point of cooperation in the game. The occurrence of 'burning' (i.e., the deliberate breaking of agreement by the winning team) during the course of the exercise is examined in relation to temptation to behave immorally; the immediate reaction, accusation, and response of the losing team; and the outcome of the conflict. The dilemma faced by Ss is discussed in terms of the sense of failure and distrust experienced by the losing team and the winning team members' feelings that the losers are being unreasonable. The necessity for emotional disclosure, the nature of articulation (rational reconstruction vs practical deliberation), and the certitude and egocentricity involved in the accusation/response phase of moral conflict are also discussed.

repeated MPD. We consider this question theoretically and
experimentally. We find experimentally that 50\% of participant pairs
undertake turn-taking in the finitely repeated MPD. Turn taking
continues to the final round for 37.5\% of participant pairs, indicating
that at least 18\% of participant pairs exhibit cooperative preferences.

"{Second-order free riders, who do not owe punishment cost to first-order
free riders in public goods games, lead to low cooperation. Previous
studies suggest that for stable cooperation, it is critical to have a
pool punishment system with second-order punishment, which gathers
resources from group members and punishes second-order free riders as
well as first-order free riders. In this study, we focus on the priority
of punishment. We hypothesize that the pool punishment system that
prioritizes second-order punishment is more likely to achieve
cooperation than the system that prioritizes first-order punishment,
because the former is more likely to obtain sufficient punishment
resources. In the experiments, we compare four pool punishment systems:
1To2 (first-order punishment to second-order punishment), 2To1
(second-order punishment to first-order punishment), 1ONLY (first-order
punishment only), and 2ONLY (second-order punishment only). We find that
the 2To1 and 2ONLY systems can receive more support than the 1To2 and
1ONLY systems and only the 2To1 system can achieve high cooperation.
However, the effect of priority of second-order punishment is observed
only when the punishment ratio (PR) is low (Experiment 1), not high

"{Aggressive interactions between groups are frequent in human societies
and can bear significant fitness costs and benefits (e.g. death or
access to resources). During between-group competitive interactions,
more cohesive groups (i.e. groups formed by individuals who cooperate in
group defence) should outperform less cohesive groups, other factors
being equal (e.g. group size). The cost/benefit of between-group
competition are thought to have driven correlated evolution of traits
that favour between-group aggression and within-group cooperation (e.g.
parochial altruism). Our aim was to analyse whether the proximate
relationship between between-group competition and within-group
cooperation is found in 3-10 years old children and the developmental
trajectory of such a relationship. We used a large cohort of children (n
= 120) and tested whether simulated between-group competition increased
within-group cooperation (i.e. how much of a resource children were
giving to their group companions) in two experiments. We found greater
within-group cooperation when groups of four children were competing
with other groups then in the control condition (no between-group
competition). Within-group cooperation increased with age. Our study
suggests that parochial altruism and in-group/out-group biases emerge
early during the course of human development.}"
"{We study the effect of intuitive and reflective processes on cooperation
using cognitive load. Compared with time constraint, which has been used
in the previous literature, cognitive load is a more direct way to block
reflective processes, and thus a more suitable way to study the link
between intuition and cooperation. Using a repeated public goods game,
we study the effect of different levels of cognitive load on
contributions. We show that a higher cognitive load increases the
initial level of cooperation. In particular, subjects are significantly
less likely to fully free ride under high cognitive load.}"

increases with age, but that the gap between cooperation among in-group
members and cooperation towards children speaking another language is
considerable and develops with age. This gap is due to both in-group
favoritism and language group discrimination. While the former is
persistent across all age groups and both language groups and accounts
for most of the discrimination observed, the latter only emerges in
later years of primary school among children belonging to the German

"{Cooperation coexisting with defection is a common phenomenon in nature

kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, graph selection and
group selection have provided conditions that cooperators outcompete
defectors. However, a simple mechanism of the long-term stable
coexistence of cooperation and defection is still lacking. To reveal the
effect of direct reciprocity on the coexistence of cooperation and
defection, we conducted a simple experiment based on the Prisoner's
Dilemma (PD) game, where the basic idea behind our experiment is that
all players in a PD game should prefer a cooperator as an opponent. Our
experimental and theoretical results show clearly that the strategies
allowing opting out against defection are able to maintain this stable
coexistence.}"
"{In this paper, we analyze the nature of cooperation in different
corruption regimes. In a laboratory experiment with university students
in Mexico, individuals play first a corruption game and then a public
goods game. The corruption game is divided into three groups: high- and
low-monitoring scenarios as well as a control group not exposed to the
game. The public goods game is divided into three groups: the standard
game, a game with centralized punishment executed by an exogenously
assigned leader, and a game similar to the second one, but adding the
possibility of counter-punishment. There are four key results. First,
there is more corruption in the low-monitoring group. Second, in the
public goods game there is less cooperation in the low-monitoring group
than in the group with more intensive monitoring. Third, the option of
punishment increases cooperation, but the sensitivity to punishment is
greater in the high-monitoring (low-corruption) group. Fourth, the
option of counter-punishment of the leader decreases cooperation. Our

"{Human cooperation is enigmatic, as organisms are expected, by
evolutionary and economic theory, to act principally in their own
interests. However, cooperation requires individuals to sacrifice
resources for each other's benefit. We conducted a series of novel
experiments in a foraging society where social institutions make the
study of social image and punishment particularly salient. Participants
played simple cooperation games where they could punish non-cooperators,
promote a positive social image or do so in combination with one
another. We show that although all these mechanisms raise cooperation
above baseline levels, only when social image alone is at stake do
average economic gains rise significantly above baseline. Punishment,
either alone or combined with social image building, yields lower gains.
Individuals' desire to establish a positive social image thus emerges as
a more decisive factor than punishment in promoting human cooperation.}"
"{This paper contributes to the experimental analysis of sustainable
behavior in artisanal fisheries and the external validity of economic
experiments. We run a standard one-shot public goods experiment and two
time preferences experiments with fishermen from Tasajera. It is a small
fishing community located in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, which
depends mainly on the fishery resources of the Cienaga Grande de Santa
Marta for its livelihood. To investigate the external validity of the
experiments, we related the fishermen's individual decisions in the
experiments to some indices measuring the ecological impact of fishing
activities among the same group of fishermen. We found that fishermen's
contributions to the public good and their levels of impatience are not
robustly correlated to their real fishing behavior. We argue that the
link between fishermen's behavior in the field experiments and real life
could be associated to various factors, such as the specific context in
which fishermen live, and the way in which cooperation in real life is
measured. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}"
"There is a wealth of literature about knowledge transfer in general, but only a small amount deals with cultural and motivational factors of knowledge transfer. The main question of this article is: How can knowledge transfer be supported? First, we present a theoretical underpinning of knowledge transfer as a social dilemma situation. Second, we analyze how a situation of social dilemma can be overcome by means of structural and motivational solutions. Third, we provide empirical evidence from our survey in hospitals. These findings support three of our five hypotheses: direct channels for interaction, organizational culture, and intrinsic motivation are relevant requirements for knowledge transfer. Team size is not a significant factor for transferring knowledge in hospitals. Furthermore, our empirical findings differentiate between providing and obtaining knowledge. The last finding leads back to a modification of the theoretical framework. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Will a group of people reach a collective target through individual contributions when everyone suffers individually if the target is missed? This 'collective-risk social dilemma' exists in various social scenarios, the globally most challenging one being the prevention of dangerous climate change. Reaching the collective target requires individual sacrifice, with benefits to all but no guarantee that others will also contribute. It even seems tempting to contribute less and save money to induce others to contribute more, hence the dilemma and the risk of failure. Here, we introduce the collective-risk social dilemma and simulate it in a controlled experiment: Will a group of people reach a fixed target sum through successive monetary contributions, when they know they will lose all their remaining money with a certain probability if they fail to reach the target sum? We find that, under high risk of simulated dangerous climate change, half of the groups succeed in reaching the target sum, whereas the others only marginally fail. When the risk of loss is only as high as the necessary average investment or even lower, the groups generally fail to reach the target sum. We conclude that one possible strategy to relieve the collective-risk dilemma in high-risk situations is to convince people that failure to invest enough is very likely to cause grave financial loss to the individual. Our analysis describes the social window humankind has to prevent dangerous climate change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In public good dilemmas, people often coordinate their decisions by applying the equality rule. Prior research has shown that if one member violates equality, negative emotions emerge among the other group members. In two experimental studies we investigated whether the presence of a violator also affects contribution decisions. A first experiment demonstrated that a violation of equality does not always influence people’s contributions. Even after an equality violation, group members continued to base their decisions on the equality rule if they faced a social dilemma with the same group members. But when group members faced a social dilemma with only the violator of equality, contributions were lowered. Experiment 2 showed that this is especially true for low trusters.

"In-group favoritism in social dilemma situations is one of Social Identity Theory’s main findings. We investigate what causes the in-group bias: is it merely due to group affiliation or, alternatively, is guilt-aversion moderating the strength of in-group favoring? We induce group membership in a minimal group setting, observe in-/out-group transfers and elicit corresponding beliefs. According to our experimental data group affiliation affects beliefs and explains a substantial part of the bias. Evidence for guilt-aversion is found only when beliefs are elicited before actions.

"In organizations, leaders are often paid more than lower-level employees. Social dilemma research also shows that leaders feel entitled to earn more, and because of this, are more inclined to contribute less than an equal share to a public good, which may damage the collective. In two experiments, the social dilemma context is used to examine how group members react when either a leader or a follower violates the equality norm. Moreover, we demonstrate how asking for forgiveness sometimes mitigates people's reactions to equality norm violations. Results show that asking for forgiveness attenuates negative emotions, retribution, and non-cooperation—but more so if followers, relative to leaders, violated equality. In fact, leaders are less likely to be seen as even violating norms, suggesting that group members perceive leaders to be entitled. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In social decision making, punishing non-cooperation and rewarding cooperation may not only affect cooperation because of instrumental reasons. They may also evoke moral concerns regarding cooperation as they signal that cooperation is socially approved of and non-cooperation socially disapproved of. I argue that punishments do this to a greater extent than rewards as punishments communicate an obligatory rule and rewards communicate a voluntary rule. Indeed, the first experiment shows that, in a social dilemma, the concept of punishment increased cooperation and the concept of a reward did not. The second experiment showed that participants showed more disapproval towards an offender when there was a punishment for non-compliance than when there was a reward for compliance. These findings suggest that punishing non-cooperation more strongly foster moral concerns regarding cooperation than rewarding cooperation. Possible implications for internalizations are discussed.

"The authors present an interdependence theoretical framework and advance the argument that generosity serves the important purpose of communicating trust, which is assumed to be of utmost importance to coping with incidents of negative noise (i.e., when the other every now and then behaves less cooperatively than intended). Using a new social dilemma task (the parcel delivery paradigm), it was hypothesized that incidents of negative noise would exert detrimental effects on trust and trust-related judgments and experiences, as well as cooperation, and that relative to tit for tat and self-regarding strategies (stingy or unconditionally cooperative strategies), other-regarding strategies (i.e., unconditional cooperation and generosity) would be more effective at reducing such as detrimental effects. Results from 2 studies provided strong support for these hypotheses, suggesting that the power of generosity is underestimated in the extant literature, especially in its ability to maintain or build trust, which is essential for coping with noise.

"We investigated how differently people punish a free-rider in three experiments. Experiment 1 was conducted to examine how individual levels of trust and self-fairness influence their punishing behavior in a 5-person social dilemma. The results showed that trustful and unfair people, as well as distrustful and fair people, punish a free-rider more. To account for these results, we carried out a vignette-type study in Experiment 2, in which participants rated how likely they were to engage in a variety of punishing behaviors that typically happen in the real world. A factor analysis indicated that people usually assign two different types of meanings to punishing behaviors. One is 'Vengeance,' which unfair people, regardless of their levels of trust, tend to inflict; the other is 'Warning,' which tends to be favored by fair people. The results of Experiment 3, another vignette study, showed that observers also consider Vengeance as unfair and Warning fair. These findings imply that participants assigned one of the two meanings to their punishments in Experiment 1 depending on their levels of trust.

"Research shows that public commitment making helps promote pro-environmental behavior. However, not everyone may be willing to make such commitments. Therefore, it is important to investigate the conditions under which commitment making is likely to occur. We expected dispositional trust and situational expectations to determine the willingness to install a system of public commitments. Two studies are presented which show that group members low in dispositional trust (low trusters) are likely to choose for a public commitment system when their situational expectations concerning other group members’ contributions are high, while those high in dispositional trust (high trusters) are likely to choose for a public commitment system when their situational expectations concerning other group members’ contributions are low. It appears that for both low and high trusters the choice for a system of public commitments is instigated by a motivation to further the collective outcomes.

"The present research examines whether or not endowment asymmetry leads those with many endowments to contribute more than those with few endowments towards the public good (i.e., a first-order dilemma), but also towards the implementation of a sanctioning system (i.e., a second-order dilemma). In Experiment 1, we found that those with many endowments contributed more than those with few endowments in a public good dilemma without a sanctioning system present, whereas those with many endowments did not contribute more than those with few endowments toward the implementation of a sanctioning system. The latter effect, however, was eliminated when participants were accountable (i.e., when expectations that they would have to justify their decisions to others in the group were high). Experiment 2 showed that when participants were accountable, the contributions of those with many endowments (and not those with few endowments) toward the sanctioning system increased, but only when they perceived the group to be more self-evaluative in terms of morality (i.e., high-evaluation expectancy). Experiment 3 showed that this effect of evaluation expectancy only emerged when participants were accountable to the whole group rather than to only one group member.

"Previous research has indicated that in social dilemmas, people tacitly coordinate their decisions by using the equal division rule. In 3 experimental studies, the authors investigated the extent to which a common understanding about task and behavioral requirements is essential for the tacit coordination process. The results show that people are less likely to coordinate on the equal division rule when collective feedback on past performance (Study 1), the distribution of information within the group (Study 2), or expected behavioral variance (Study 3) suggests that a common understanding in the group is lacking. Moreover, the results indicate that under these conditions, rather than adhering to the equal division rule, people base their decisions on their own social value orientations. The findings support the view that if situations provide insufficient cues for tacit coordination, people are more likely to decide on the basis of their personal characteristics.

"This study adopted a contextual framework to examine whether an interaction between group culture and economic power influences self-interest in a simulated commons dilemma. Full-time managers enrolled in executive MBA programs in Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States (US) made decisions in an asymmetric commons dilemma. Relative to managers from the US and Germany, Israeli managers were more likely to follow an individually rational decision-making approach, taking more resources in a high versus low economic power condition. In contrast, managers from Hong Kong in a high economic power condition followed a collectively rational approach, voluntarily taking fewer resources. Egocentrism mediated this interaction effect of group culture and economic power for the Israeli managers who were more egocentric and believed it was fair to harvest more resources in a high power condition. However, egocentrism did not mediate the interaction effect for managers from Hong Kong. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings highlight the importance of studying the proximal effect of group culture on contextual factors, such as economic power asymmetry, that influence cooperation in social dilemmas.

"A group identification approach to social dilemmas is proposed, and the results of three studies are presented. Study 1 found that members of real groups were more cooperative than members of contrived groups and that this effect was mediated by group identification. Study 2 showed that participants were more cooperative when their in-group was in the majority and that this effect was moderated by strength of group identity. Study 3 replicated the mediation pattern found in Study 1 using different groups and a more rigorous method. In all three studies, measures of group concern, group trust, normative expectations, concern for personal benefit, estimated futility, and estimated redundancy were also administered. Both group identification and ego incentive motives need to be considered to fully understand people's responses to social dilemmas under varying social circumstances.

"Sometimes people may no longer engage in conservational behavior (e.g., to reduce emissions) because their attempts to do so have been thwarted by 'negative noise', or external forces that may cause otherwise cooperative intentions to translate into non-cooperative action (e.g., strikes prevented to commute by public transport rather than by car). The purpose of the present research is to examine whether experiences with negative noise in a commons dilemma may undermine conservational motivation and behavior, even in a subsequent commons dilemma that is free of noise. Participants first interacted in a commons dilemma task--with noise versus without noise--in which the common pool was sustained versus deteriorating. Afterwards, participants were involved in an identical second task in the same pool size condition but noise-free for everybody. Consistent with hypotheses, participants who faced noise and a deteriorating resource in the first task exhibited lower levels of conservation in the second task than did participants who were always acting free of noise. This pattern was mediated by a reduced motivation to preserve the common pool, suggesting that the experience of noise in combination with a decline in collective resources may especially undermine cooperative motivation and behavior.

"The hypothesis, that injunctive and descriptive norms interact positively or synergistically to promote cooperation in social dilemmas, is tested in the context of a survey study focusing on environmentally responsible behaviour.

The result is stable across three replications spanning a two-year period. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Research has shown that if equality is violated in public-good dilemmas, group members react with more anger if another group member (a follower), rather than if the leader violates equality.

Results revealed that group members low in need for emotion reacted with more anger and were more inclined to exclude the violator if this person was a follower, rather than the leader of the group. Group members high in need for emotion, however, reacted with more anger and wished to exclude the violator more if this person was the leader, rather than a follower.

"The present study (N = 200) investigated participants' attributions for explaining the behavior of noncooperative and cooperative targets in a commons and anticommons dilemma. The attribution dimensions of concern for others, fear, (low levels of) greed, and efficiency were highly related and were interpreted to reflect prosocial orientation. Cooperative targets were judged as more prosocial, but these differences were more pronounced in the commons than in the anticommons dilemma. Cross-over interaction effects were obtained for ignorance and fear, revealing higher attribution scores for the noncooperative target in the commons dilemma and the cooperative target in the anticommons dilemma. It is argued that commons and anticommons dilemmas constitute different frames of reference for judging cooperative behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Most psychological theories and research on shame focus on the ugly aspects and negative consequences of this emotion. Theories on moral emotions, however, assume that shame acts as a commitment device motivating prosocial behavior. To solve this apparent paradox, the authors studied the effects of shame on prosocial behavior. Shame was hypothesized to motivate prosocial behavior when it was relevant for the decision at hand (endogenous). In contrast, shame that was not relevant for the decision at hand (exogenous) was hypothesized to have no such effects. Four experiments with three different shame inductions and two different measures of prosocial behavior confirmed that endogenous shame motivated prosocial behavior for proselfs but that exogenous shame did not. Shame is shown to have a clear interpersonal function in the sense that it acts as a commitment device. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Reports the results of an experiment designed primarily to test and contrast the predictions derived from 2 models—a subjective expected utility model and a cooperative model—regarding the effects of threshold uncertainty on contribution for the provision of step-level public goods. The study also tested the joint effect of the threshold uncertainty level and its mean (low vs high) on contribution, and examined the effect of threshold uncertainty on the individuals' estimates regarding the contributions of other group members. Results show that the effect of threshold uncertainty is moderated by the threshold mean: Contribution to the public good increased as a function of uncertainty for the lower threshold mean, and decreased (though not significantly) for the higher threshold mean. In contrast, for the 2 threshold means the Ss' estimates of the mean and variability of others' contribution increased with threshold uncertainty. The models' comparison revealed that the cooperative model was superior to the subjective expected utility model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Previous studies have demonstrated that communication facilitates the provision of public goods, and that part of the success of communication lies in its propensity to elicit promises to contribute. In this article we focus on reactions to conditional promises, and in particular on 'promises than cannot be broken' (i.e. conditional contributions). In an experimental study, participants were led to believe they were a member of a five-person group in which one member made a conditional contribution. The results of this study suggest that behavioral reactions to conditional contributions are a function of the motivation ascribed to conditional contributors, which in turn appears to be a function of the interest conditional contributors have in providing the public good. In more general terms, the results suggest that group members reciprocate the motivation they ascribe to the conditional contributor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Two experimental studies investigated the role of group identification in the selection of and cooperation with leaders to manage public good dilemmas. The findings of the 1st study revealed that there was a general preference to select leaders with a legitimate power base (i.e., democratic, elected, and internal leaders), but these preferences were particularly pronounced when people's identification with their group was high rather than low. The 2nd study complemented these findings by showing that when group identification was low, an instrumental leader (i.e., who punishes noncontributing members) was far more efficient than a relational leader (i.e., who builds positive intragroup relations) in raising contributions. Yet, when group identification was high, both leader types appeared to be equally efficient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This study examined the effects of issue importance on social identity, personal identification with an issue and contribution decisions in a public goods social dilemma. A total of 331 undergraduate students from the University of Oklahoma were recruited from the introductory psychology course to participate as one alternative for fulfilling course requirements. Potential participants were identified as high or low in the extent to which they could personally identify with a list of social issues measured during a pre-testing session. The specific issue was chosen based on approximately equal numbers of high and low levels of importance responses within the population. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of two group sizes and to either actual or fictitious groups. Actual groups of 4 and 8 discussed the issue and fictitious groups engaged in a thought listing procedure regarding the issue. Social identity, personal identification with the issue, contribution decisions and self-efficacy were measured in a 2 (important/unimportant issue) x 2 (group size = 4 or 8) x 2 (actual/fictitious, groups) design. Results showed that neither the salience of social identity nor personal identification with the issue prevented group size effects in terms of cooperative contribution decisions made before and after feedback during the public goods dilemma game. The greatest proportions of cooperative contributions came from both actual and fictitious groups of 4 with the issue viewed as important by group members. Actual groups in general had significantly higher levels of social identity than fictitious groups even when the issue was not considered important. In contrast, fictitious groups had significantly higher levels of both personal identification with the issue and self-efficacy. Group size effects were not present, however, when donation decisions were made to give the lottery winnings to the cause surrounding the issue. The highest percentages of donation decisions were from important issue conditions in both actual and fictitious groups. However, the greatest proportions of donations came from fictitious groups where both personal identification with the issue and self-efficacy were highest.

"Examined the effects of social uncertainty regarding the possibility that needed goods might be supplied externally on contribution behavior, regardless of the groups' efforts to secure their provision. The authors first provide a description of step level public goods and summarize 3 previous theoretical models (a subjective expected value model, a cooperative model, and a game theoretical model) developed to account for individual contribution for step level goods. The next section summarizes 2 individual attribute variables—namely, social value orientation and risk preference. The authors then describe the experimental paradigm for the modified step level game with external supply, and extend the previously described models for the case of the modified game. An experiment conducted using 40 undergraduate Ss is outlined to examine contribution behavior under various probabilities of external supply, and to compare the predictive power of the derived models. Finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion regarding the implications of the present research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A consistent finding in experimental economics games is that players cooperate with one another more than would be predicted by a standard game theoretical analysis. One approach to understanding when and why players cooperate in these games is to consider the adaptive problems faced by human ancestors and the systems designed to solve these problems. This analysis suggests that these systems should be sensitive to particular features of the environment that activate decision rules that cause one to incur costs to benefit one's group. It is hypothesized that due to the extremely computationally complex problems associated with coordinating the actions of multiple individuals, these systems might be sensitive to cues that indicate that one is able to coordinate with other members of a group. Further, because the demands of 'real-time' coordination are particularly strong for hunting and warfare, activities thought to have been predominantly in the domain of males, males might be more likely to be affected by the presence of these cues. Two experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. In these studies, subjects in a public goods game were induced to engage in behaviors that were hypothesized to activate systems designed to detect the ability to coordinate. In particular, subjects matched eyegazes with one another, touched one another gently, and tapped out rhythms in synchrony. Contributions in these conditions were compared to contributions in a baseline condition as well as a condition in which communication was allowed, but only through a virtual 'chat room' generated on computers. Results indicated that matching eyegazes and touching one another did increase rates of contributions to the public good for male but not female subjects. Counter to hypotheses, the rhythm manipulation had no effect, and communication over the computer network did increase contributions for male but not female subjects. It is suggested that considering the nature of the adaptations for solving both the free rider problem and the coordination problem represents a potentially valuable direction for future research.

"Used a multistage social dilemma to explore the notion that focusing on part rather than all of a complex problem would affect self-efficacy and action. In 2 experiments, 268 female undergraduates considered a multistage game asking them to invest an initial sum of money in hopes of earning a larger bonus to be paid if provision points were met at all stages (a 'stage-conjunctive' task). Ss in Exp 1 were scheduled in groups of 5, whereas Ss in Exp 2 were told that they were part of a group of 50 players. Under most conditions, presentation of the whole problem encouraged cooperation. The opposite pattern occurred when group members were asked to complete very demanding stages first. The authors suggest that these results depend strongly on the stage-conjunctive nature of the large win and the social dilemma nature of each small win.

These results were found when Ss indicated whether each justification was true or false (and their responses were correlated with their voting), when they chose justifications from a list, or when they provided open-ended responses.

mutual cooperation or generous ZD strategies. In laboratory experiments
in which human subjects were paired with computer co-players, we
demonstrate that both the generous and the extortionate ZD strategies
indeed enforce a unilateral control of the reward. When the experimental
setting is sufficiently long and the computerized nature of the opponent
is known to human subjects, the extortionate strategy outperforms the
generous strategy. Human subjects' cooperation rates when playing
against extortionate and generous ZD strategies are similar after
learning has occurred. More than half of extortionate strategists

correlated with cooperation. Proselfs' decisions were marked by strong
DLPFC and weak amygdala activity, and prosocials' decisions were marked
by strong amygdala activity, with the DLPFC signal increasing only in

by DLPFC-mediated deliberative processes, while prosocials' decisions

"Presents studies that address R. Axelrod's (1984) prescription to not worry about the outcomes that others receive in a social dilemma, a mixed-motive situation in which interdependent group members face a conflict between selfish and collective gain. Exp 1 determined whether cooperation is reduced when a person stands to receive poorer outcomes than an opponent and if people who experience lesser outcomes are unresponsive to a reciprocal strategy. Results showed that people do attend and react to others' outcomes, with Ss whose outcomes were of a lesser magnitude than the opponent being uncooperative and Ss with greater-magnitude outcomes being very cooperative. This was true even though own and other outcomes were linearly equivalent. The 2nd study showed that dispositional envy can predict cooperation rate and that referent cognitions theory can be applied to help alleviate the impact of differing outcomes, by making amends for small-magnitude outcomes at the end of the game (amelioration) and by providing a reasonable explanation for why the differences in outcomes exist (justification), although the former intervention was ineffective with people with high levels of dispositional envy. Discussion focuses on the role of mental simulations in the reduction of envy effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Three experiments investigated the hypothesis that power increases an action orientation in the power holder, even in contexts where power is not directly experienced. In Experiment 1, participants who possessed structural power in a group task were more likely to take a card in a simulated game of blackjack than those who lacked power. In Experiment 2, participants primed with high power were more likely to act against an annoying stimulus (a fan) in the environment, suggesting that the experience of power leads to the performance of goal-directed behavior. In Experiment 3, priming high power led to action in a social dilemma regardless of whether that action had prosocial or antisocial consequences. The effects of priming power are discussed in relation to the broader literature on conceptual and mind-set priming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Three studies tested the hypotheses that inequality among group members, as well as specific reasons for inequality, would significantly influence strength of group identification and cooperative responses to a social dilemma. In Study 1, participants reacted to scenarios describing a public good social dilemma. For some scenarios there was an equal distribution of initial resources, while in others the distribution was unequal. As predicted, group identification led to more cooperation in the dilemma. Starting with more money tended to reduce group identification for females but to increase it for males. In Study 2, participants were faced with an actual one-trial public good social dilemma involving real money. In some conditions, participants began with endowments of different sizes, and the inequality was explained as either random or justified. As predicted, reasons for inequality as well as the fact of inequality had an impact on group identification which, in turn, influenced cooperation in the dilemma. Replicating the results of Study 1, different conditions tended to enhance group identification for women and men. Study 3 was a conceptual replication of Study 2, and resulted in similar findings.

"This research investigates the role of intermittent monetary costs in restraining individuals from defection in social dilemmas. In Experiment 1, 104 car owners made fictitious choices between a slow and a fast travel mode in the context of a continuous social dilemma. There were four different conditions of monetary costs for choosing the fast mode (defection): no cost, low cost, high cost to self or high cost to others. Participants defected most when there was no cost and least when they themselves were charged a high cost. A spill-over effect was obtained such that when others were charged a high cost to defect, defection rates were lower than under no cost. Experiment 2 used 36 undergraduates as participants in an iterated decision task with real groups. The results replicated the major results of Experiment 1. Furthermore, whereas prosocials were strongly affected by intermittent costs for defection (i.e. showed large spill-over effects), proselfs seemed to be unaffected. Possible explanations of this interaction effect between social value orientation and intermittent punishment for defection are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The existence of cooperation and social order among genetically unrelated individuals is a fundamental problem in the behavioral sciences. The prevailing approaches in biology and economics view cooperation exclusively as self-interested behavior--unrelated individuals cooperate only if they face economic rewards or sanctions rendering cooperation a self-interested choice. Whether economic incentives are perceived as just or legitimate does not matter in these theories. Fairness-based altruism is, however, a powerful source of human cooperation. In a series of social dilemma experiments with 283 university students, this study shows that the prevailing self-interest approach has serious shortcomings because it overlooks negative effects of sanctions on human altruism. Sanctions revealing selfish or greedy intentions destroy altruistic cooperation almost completely, whereas sanctions perceived as fair leave altruism intact. These findings challenge proximate and ultimate theories of human cooperation that neglect the distinction between fair and unfair sanctions, and they are probably relevant in all domains in which voluntary compliance matters--in relations between spouses, in the education of children, in business relations and organizations, as well as in markets.

"This study investigated whether cognitions and behavior in an asymmetric social dilemma can be predicted by national culture. Results indicated that, as predicted, groups of decision makers from Japan--a collectivist, hierarchical culture--were more cooperative, expected others to be more cooperative, and were more likely to adopt an equal allocation distribution rule to resolve the dilemma than were groups of decision makers from the US--an individualist, egalitarian culture. An opportunity for communication had a greater impact on expectations of others' behavior in groups of U.S. decision makers than in groups of Japanese decision makers.

Rewards and punishments were equally effective in promoting cooperation among 124 19–21 yr olds, regardless of whether the government (Exps 1 and 2) or the parent company (Exps 3 and 4) supplied incentives. However, for 239 managers, government-supplied rewards aroused reactance and were counterproductive. Rewards supplied by the parent company promoted compliance.

"In computer simulation studies of the prisoner's dilemma conducted by R. Axelrod (1984), the tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy was found to be most effective. Two important properties of the TFT strategy are based on the reciprocity norm: (1) it is 'provocable' and immediately retaliates if the other person defects and (2) it is 'forgiving' and immediately reciprocates cooperation if the other returns to cooperation after defection. Delay of reciprocity for the 2 types of TFT properties were varied in 2 experiments. In each experiment a male undergraduate was led to believe that he was playing a 2-person prisoner's dilemma, but he actually played against a programmed strategy. Mean proportion of cooperative choices was greater when cooperative overtures were reciprocated immediately than when they were delayed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Effects of environmental conditions on 21 families with an aggressive male adolescent (aged 12–14 yrs) and control families were studied in 3 experimental tasks. In 2 of the tasks, aggressive adolescent families became, over time, more competitive and angry and relatively less able to solve family conflicts. During family discussions of the adolescent's problem behaviors, aggressive families showed poorer problem-solving skills and greater negativity than control families. Prisoner's Dilemma was played under 3 conditions (rewarding initially cooperative, then competitive and finally, cooperative responses again). Self and observer ratings indicated that aggressive family members were more angry at the end of Prisoner's Dilemma and during adolescent problem discussions than were control families. Aggressive adolescents also differed from controls in that they scored much higher on the Psychoticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory.

No difference in effectiveness was found between the strategies when there was no communication between opponents, but GRIT was superior to TFT in terms of influencing Ss to cooperate when communication was employed.

"Compared the causal attributions made by cooperators and defectors for a cooperative and noncooperative target in an N-Person Prisoner's Dilemma, using 150 Dutch Ss (aged 14–37 yrs). Factor analyses of attributions yielded 2 factors associated with the target's intrapersonal processes. One intrapersonal factor was a combination of weakness and lack of intelligence, labeled Ignorance, and the second was related to good vs bad, labeled Concern for Others. Among cooperators, noncooperation was attributed more than cooperation to Ignorance. Defectors did just the opposite. Both cooperators and defectors attributed cooperation more than noncooperation to Concern for Others. However, Cooperators made the largest discriminations on this factor. The different dilemmas appeared to affect both cooperators' and defectors' attributions to Fear and Greed in a manner consistent with their underlying game theoretical differences.

"Examined the influence of preexisting individual differences in social value orientations on perceptions of rationality (RAT) in a social dilemma.

The cross-cultural generalizability of this finding was supported in Exp 2, with 66 undergraduates in the US. Results are consistent with the Goal Prescribes Rationality Principle (P. A. van Lange et al, 1990), which assumes that people with prosocial (cooperative) orientations perceive RAT in social dilemmas primarily from the collective perspective, whereas individualists and competitors take a strong egocentric perspective. A strong relationship was found between expectations of other's cooperation and own cooperative behavior when the other was described as intelligent.

The 2 scenarios were based on parameters established by a generalized uniform N-person dilemma game. One scenario was described in a give-some context (contribute to the collective good); the other was presented in a take-some context (destruction of an existing collective good). Reliable framing effects were evidenced. Individuals were more willing to contribute to a collective good than to experience some personal loss to avoid the destruction of an existing collective good.

"Examined a 2-person social dilemma characterized by the conflict between the pursuit of one's own vs collective benefits in 2 experiments with 70 Dutch Ss and 71 American undergraduates. Considerably more cooperation was expected from a person perceived as highly moral than from another perceived as low on morality. This effect was not moderated by individual differences in social value orientation. In addition, Ss with prosocial value orientations, as well as those with individualistic and competitive orientations cooperated considerably more with a person perceived as highly moral than with another perceived as low on morality. This suggests that individuals who are predisposed to choose noncooperatively in social dilemmas are willing to cooperate if they are quite confident that the other has truly cooperative and good intentions. Results were stable across the 2 countries. (French abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Identifies the tit-for-tat strategy as a well-known solution to the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. This strategy (1) is 'nice' in that it cooperates on the 1st move of the game, (2) is retaliatory in that it follows a move of defection by the opponent, and (3) is forgiving in that it cooperates with an opponent that has defected in the past but that cooperates in the present. Predator inspection was examined to determine whether guppies displayed these characteristics. Inspection consisted of attempts by a pumpkinseed sunfish in an aquarium to lunge at guppy pairs in an adjacent aquarium. Guppies seemed to employ a tit-for-tat strategy. In addition, nice, retaliatory, and forgiving behaviors were not seen in the absence of a predator and thus seem to be context-specific reactions.

A schema model suggests that social motive differences reflect differences in cognitive knowledge structures. Prescriptive message content and partner strategy were manipulated to test these models. The goal model predicted that the prescriptive message would affect behavior most when it was congruent with the S's own goals. The schema model predicted that a message consistent with S's schema would prime related elements of that schema and amplify the usual response to one's partner's strategy.

"In the standard one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma game, participants often choose to cooperate, when the optimal strategy is to defect. This puzzling finding has attracted considerable interest both in terms of possible computational frameworks for modeling human judgment, but also regarding the more general debate of human altruism. In this research, we ask how much of human behavior in this task can be explained by a putative bias for cooperative behavior and whether this, in turn, is influenced by personality. We compared performance on the standard task with performance on a matched neutral one; we manipulated the optimal strategy (defect or cooperate); and we manipulated the amount of payoff for responding optimally. Results revealed little evidence for a bias for cooperative behavior, but significant associations with the personality factors of Behavioural Activation System (BAS) Reward Responsivity and Agreeableness were found. These findings are discussed in terms of the attempt to explain judgment in one-shot, Prisoner’s Dilemma tasks with statistical or probabilistic models.

"The authors investigated how the presence or absence of monetary incentives in a prisoner’s dilemma game may influence research outcomes. Specifically, the predictive power of the Big Five personality traits on decisions in an incentivized (N = 60) or hypothetical (N = 60) prisoner’s dilemma game was investigated. Participants were less generous in the incentivized game. More importantly, personality predicted decisions only in the incentivized game, with low Neuroticism and high Openness to Experience predicting more cooperative transfers. The influence of Neuroticism on behaviour in the incentivized game was mediated by risk attitude. The results are consistent with other results suggesting that the Big Five are relevant predictors of moral behaviour, and with results suggesting that the determinants of hypothetical decisions are different from the determinants of real decisions, with the latter being more revealing of one’s true preferences. The authors argue that psychologists, contrary to prevailing praxis, should consider making their participants’ decisions more real. This could allow psychologists to more convincingly generalize laboratory findings into contexts outside of the laboratory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

"We study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner’s dilemma game where players are allowed to establish new interactions with others. By employing a simple coevolutionary rule entailing only two crucial parameters, we find that different selection criteria for the new interaction partners as well as their number vitally affect the outcome of the game. The resolution of the social dilemma is most probable if the selection favors more successful players and if their maximally attainable number is restricted. While the preferential selection of the best players promotes cooperation irrespective of game parametrization, the optimal number of new interactions depends somewhat on the temptation to defect. Our findings reveal that the ‘‘making of new friends’’ may be an important activity for the successful evolution of cooperation, but also that partners must be selected carefully and their number limited.

"In an experimental study, we investigated how decisions in social dilemmas are affected by the valence of outcomes that are at stake. Prospect theory states that individuals are risk-averse when outcomes are framed as gains, and risk-seeking when outcomes are framed as losses. On the basis of this framework, previous research on social dilemmas has addressed the question of whether people are more cooperative in the negative domain than in the positive domain, but this research has led to inconsistent results. A possible explanation for this is that in many social dilemmas it is unclear whether cooperation or defection is the risky choice. In the current paper, we compare the well-studied prisoner’s dilemma with the less studied chicken game. Whereas in the prisoner’s dilemma it is unclear what constitutes the risky option, in the chicken game the risky option is quite clear. Consistent with predictions, we found in the chicken game more defection in the loss frame than in the gain frame, but no difference between the gain and loss frame in the prisoner’s dilemma. Moreover, choices were predicted by risk attitude in the chicken game, but not in the prisoner’s dilemma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"The present study focuses on the effect of agents’ utility on their cooperation in indefinitely repeated two-person prisoner’s dilemma games (PDs). A game-theoretical analysis suggests that conditions for cooperation in the PDs improve with concavity of utility, with increasing risk aversion, and with increasing loss aversion in the case of PDs with both negative and positive outcomes. The hypotheses were tested in an experiment in which participants played a number of (different) indefinitely repeated PDs and their utility was elicited. The results provide no evidence that concave utility promotes cooperation in the PDs, but we do show that cooperation is promoted by risk aversion and possibly by loss aversion.

In the experiment participants can repeatedly choose between two groups, where in one of them a (local) punishment institution fosters cooperation. The degree of population viscosity (i.e. the extent to which matching is biased towards within-group interactions) is varied across treatments. We find that both, the share of participants that choose into the group with the punishment institution and the share of participants that cooperate, increase monotonically with the degree of population viscosity. Furthermore – with higher population viscosity – significantly more subjects claim to support a punishment institution in a post-experimental questionnaire.

"There exists a wide body of literature suggesting that individuals behave more altruistically in situations that 1) provide an opportunity for reciprocation and 2) are not anonymous. Past research investigating the altruistic functions of induced social emotions have been conducted solely in the context of either iterative and/or face-to-face interactions. As a result, the altruistic behaviors found in these studies cannot be solely attributed to these induced emotions. In light of these past works, the current study compared cooperation rates of individuals following either a guilt or neutral mood induction procedure in an anonymous, one-shot social dilemma (i.e. the prisoner’s dilemma). Participants were 120 female undergraduates (60 engaged in a guilt induction procedure and 60 engaged in a neutral mood induction procedure) enrolled at a large university asked to participate in a one-shot social dilemma with a partner that they would never meet. Primary analyses found no evidence regarding group differences in rates of cooperation. Secondary analyses of subjective emotions ratings (i.e. guilt, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear) suggest that generalized negative affect may be associated with decreased rates of cooperation while positive affect may be associated with increase rates of cooperation. Future research investigating the effects of generalized negative and positive affect as well as specifically induced emotions needs to be conducted to further evaluate this suggestion.

"Theoretically informed by recent computational and mathematical studies highlighting the importance of signals and networks in the evolution of cooperation, the present research undertakes simulation experiments to investigate socio-psychological bases and structural foundations of cooperation as institutional order. Simulated societies consist of three groups of agents with markers and tolerance: altruists, defectors, and parochial egoists. They simultaneously play a one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma game with neighbors by helping tolerably similar ones and by declining to help otherwise. They either imitate markers and tolerance of more successful neighbors or switch partners by breaking the old ones to out-group neighbors after creating new ties to others if both sides accept each other as in-group. Our study furthers understanding of the dynamics of cooperation in human societies facing the Prisoner’s Dilemma: altruists alone are less likely to defeat defectors regardless of network topology as cooperation becomes costly and the average number of interaction partners increases; under these conditions, parochialism is necessary for the institutionalization of cooperation; agents adapt themselves to increasingly homogenized environments by learning intolerance; emergent cooperative societies in the presence of imitation errors are vulnerable to free-riders with tolerably similar markers; either persistent cultural diversity or highly clustered networks with long paths stabilize cooperation; and even if markers are completely mutable, society-wide and robust cooperation is achievable with increased diversity as hierarchical networks of cultural groups self-organize where less tolerant agents in the periphery shield more tolerant ones in the core from emerging free-riders. The current study provides sociologists with theoretical and methodological resources for a game-theoretical approach to institutional analysis. Socio-psychological research maintains that group identity enhances cooperation either because human subjects in pre-assigned groups maximize group-level rewards or when they expect continuing benefits from in-group favoritism. We rather demonstrate the evolution of cooperation without expectations of in-group reciprocity. Cultural groups emerge as arbitrary markers become salient together with stratification driven by parochial interactions. Our study also contributes to understanding of how stable markets can evolve out of repeated plays of a social dilemma game among parochial agents locally embedded in on-going exchange networks with limited knowledge about costs and opportunities.

"Cooperation is adaptive for humans and animals; however, some cooperative behaviors are more common than others. Mutualisms, in which organisms gain benefits during cooperation, are more common than reciprocity, in which organisms alternate roles as donors and receivers of benefits over time. Reciprocity involves more complex cognitive skills than mutualisms, requiring organisms interact repeatedly, remember past interactions, take future ones into consideration, and compare costs and benefits of cooperative behavior. Relations among costs and benefits define reciprocity, such that if costs decrease or benefits increase, a reciprocal dilemma can become a mutualism. It was traditionally assumed a prisoner's dilemma could be converted to a mutualism by changing ratios of costs and benefits, and that linear-transformations preserving ratios (e.g., increasing or decreasing costs and benefits by orders of magnitude) should not lead to changes in cooperation. This supposition assumes that costs and benefits are represented in the brain as they exist in reality—that subjective quantities increase linearly with objective quantities. However, evidence across evolution and development suggests that linear representations of quantities are accessible through experience and development to human adults, and that young children and animals represent quantities logarithmically—that is, differences among small quantities are over-estimated and differences among large quantities are compressed. Because logarithms do not preserve ratio information, linear transformations may lead objective reciprocal dilemmas to be experienced as mutualisms. This hypothesis successfully made five predictions about the effect of linear transformations on cooperative behavior. First, linear transformations of parameters led to more cooperative behavior in adults engaged in the prisoner's dilemma game, a task of reciprocal cooperation (Experiment 1). Second, logarithmically-scaled ratios of costs and benefits better predicted cooperative behavior than linearly-scaled ratios (Experiment 2). Third, linear transformations had a smaller effect on cooperation in populations with access to linear representations (adult humans, Experiment 3) than populations relying on logarithmic representations (human children; Experiment 4). Fourth, linear transformations in the prisoner's dilemma led to similar cooperative behavior as in a mutualism task (Experiments 5 and 6). Last, solitary organisms failing to meet the social cognitive requirements to engage in reciprocity (orangutans) show cooperative behavior in a linearly transformed dilemma. Together these findings show that cooperative behavior depends not on objective relations between costs and benefits, but on subjective, logarithmically-scaled relations.

"Many real-life social dilemmas contain third parties who cannot make decisions in the dilemma, but are affected by its outcome (receive externalities) nonetheless. Dilemmas with identical payoffs for decision-making actors may greatly vary in their externalities for third parties. If actors value the welfare of thirds, externalities will affect actors’ decisions. We test behavioral predictions from three leading ideas on social preferences (altruism, inequality aversion, competition) in two studies that employ four one-shot, 2-person prisoner’s dilemmas (PDs) that differ only in their externalities. The PDs respectively include a third party that (i) is indifferent, (ii) prefers defection, (iii) prefers cooperation. Our results show that while aggregate behavior is not affected by externalities, individual behavior is. Compared to a PD without externalities, prosocial individuals cooperate more when a third benefits from cooperation, but do not defect more when a third benefits from defection. The opposite pattern is found for competitive individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"Comments on an article by J. D. Heider and J.J. Skowronski (see record [rid]2007-05078-004[/rid]). The authors reanalyzed data from a set of studies—J. D. Heider and J.J. Skowronski (2007)—that explored links between the race IAT and discriminatory behavior. The studies in that report were designed to have methodological improvements over past studies of predictive validity, and the authors concluded that links between race IAT scores and 'prejudiced responding' and 'discriminatory behavior' were supported. Our reanalysis reveals that this was not the case for either study. Study 1 was designed to test for links between the race IAT and competitive behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma game. We found a pattern not conveyed in the original report, which is that the IAT predicted greater competition with both White and Black opponents. The IAT did not predict racially biased behavior. Study 2 was designed to test for links between the race IAT and friendliness of verbal and nonverbal treatment of confederates. We found that the published results for Study 2 were based on erroneous IAT scores. Analysis of the true data revealed that the race IAT did not predict racially biased behavior. These results add to recent evidence calling into question the predictive validity of the race IAT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Using functional MRI, we investigate the neural correlates of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation to cooperate by comparing people who differ in the personality trait Social Value Orientation. Participants (n = 28) played several one-shot prisoner's dilemma games (offering weak cooperative incentives) and coordination games (offering strong cooperative incentives) with anonymous partners while they were under the scanner. Behavioral results indicate that proself individuals adjust their behavior toward more cooperation when extrinsic incentives were present, while prosocials' decisions are not affected by game context. The neurological data is consistent with a priori developed hypotheses regarding different behavioral strategies, and suggest that extrinsically motivated proself strategies are driven by calculation and a situation-by-situation approach. Increased activation was found in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), and precuneus. Intrinsically motivated prosocials' strategies reflect norm compliance, routine moral judgment, and social awareness. Increased activation was found in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior STS, and inferior parietal lobule. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This study examined the effects of placing groups at a disadvantage on between group competitive behaviors. Using an intergroup prisoner’s dilemma—maximizing difference protocol—participants in small groups were either advantaged or disadvantaged in two experiments. Participants played a game where disadvantaged groups either thought they had to move second in a game in which moving first had advantages (Experiment 1) or were given less money than members of another group (Experiment 2). Results showed that participants whose teams were disadvantaged experienced more negative emotions (envy, jealousy, anger) and consistently responded with more destructive intergroup competitive behaviors. In contrast, groups who were not disadvantaged displayed less between-group competition. While past research has shown that cooperating with in-group members is the typical response in intergroup relations, this study clearly showed that considering whether a group is ahead of or behind other groups is an important consideration. Teams that are behind are more likely to compete against or somehow try to disadvantage teams that are ahead. Winning teams focus more on cooperating with teammates and focus less on disadvantaging other teams. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Beginning with Tversky and Shafir’s (1992) initial discovery, the disjunction effect (DE), a violation of Savage’s Sure-Thing Principle (1954), has raised much interest. The present research used four experiments to test whether the DE emerged gradually as people became more certain of the other player’s choice in a prisoner’s dilemma (PD). Gradually-increasing odds of the other player’s choice were framed using verbal ordinal information, concrete probabilities, and vague probabilities, respectively. The DE was replicated in three of the experiments using subjects playing against computer agents and did not emerge gradually, no matter the frame of presentation. Additionally, standard PDs differed from PDs where the other player was explicitly just as likely to cooperate as to defect, providing evidence that lower competition rates against standard PDs come from people not inferring the odds of the other player’s choice.

"A great deal of experimental evidence supports the notion of symmetry with regards to rewarding and aversive outcomes having an equally opposite effect on behavior in non-humans (Schuster & Rachlin, 1968; Farley & Fantino, 1978) as well as in humans (Critchfield et al, 2003). Numerous studies have demonstrated a direct effect of punishment, and empirical data that support conclusions pointing toward a symmetrical law of effect, such that behavior follows the matching law (Herrnstein, 1961) in equally opposing manner when compared to reinforcing outcomes. On the other hand, the domain of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) has found that loss has a disproportionately larger effect on behavior than an equivalent gain, seeming to provide evidence contrary to the symmetry argument. The current experiments were designed to test this argument of symmetry using well-established interactions (1 – the Dictator Game, 2 – the Ultimatum Game, 3 – the Prisoner's Dilemma Game), where the stimuli at stake were tokens with one of two values: a conditioned reward stimulus (timeoff a boring task) or a conditioned aversive stimulus (time-in a boring task). Both allocation and cooperative behaviors were measured and correlated significantly with Prosocial, Individualist, and Competitor Social Value Orientation across approx. N=2100 participants. Amount given of reward tokens was equal to the amount kept of aversive tokens; overall both allocation and cooperation data indicate strong support for an argument for empirical symmetry between reinforcers and punishers in social interaction settings. These findings agree with previous research observing symmetry of behavior thus reinforcing the symmetrical law of effect (Thorndike, 1911). The results also indicate the reliability of the social value orientation measure in experiments involving social interaction and division of a utility.

"The social dilemma is a special situation of social interdependence in which individual rationality is at odds with group outcomes. Such dilemmas have been examined on an empirical level with experimental games. In this study, an attempt was made to facilitate cooperative behavior and to boost cooperative attitudes toward dilemma scenarios among US undergraduates by using a series of experimental games. In general, cooperation increased after the presentation of persuasive messages. Although specific predicted interactions between need for cognition and the type of persuasive message were not found, the results indicated that public appeals for cooperation may be effective in facilitating cooperation in a social dilemma.

"The effect of personal and group goals on an individual's behavior in three-person and seven-person groups in a social dilemma was investigated. High school students (N = 274), were paid $2.30 to $4.94 for 70 minutes of decision making. The results showed that students put their self-interest ahead of that of the group. The setting of a specific group goal had no direct effect on cooperative behavior or group performance. However, self-set personal goals that were compatible with the group goal led to higher group performance than the setting of personal goals that were incompatible with the group goal. Individual and group performance suffered when individuals were not committed to a specific group goal and tenaciously held out for high individual performance. Toward the end of the simulation, cooperation with other group members increased. Members in seven-person groups (N = 28), however, were less cooperative than participants in three-person groups (N = 26). In addition, they had lower self-efficacy in making money, lower outcome expectancies that cooperation with other group members would lead to the attainment of the group goal, and lower collective-efficacy that they would make money than did the members of three-person groups.

"This study investigates groups' ability to manage resources under high and low scarcity. We offer a contingency model to reconcile competing predictions in the literature: Cooperative group behavior is moderated by group communication and the distribution of resources. A sample of 208 undergraduate students role-played 1 of 4 'division managers' in a fictional organization. They made independent organizational resource withdrawal decisions. Three independent variables were manipulated: (a) level of resource replenishment, (b) group communication prior to decision making, and (c) access to the resource. Our findings indicated strong support for the hypothesized effect of communication and moderate support for the effect of resource distribution. Results suggest that a decline in scarcity increases cooperation only when groups are allowed to communicate and when there is equal access to resources. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for group behavior in organizations are discussed, and future directions for research are offered.

"Our experiment analyzes situations in which a group engages in two dilemmas, a social dilemma and an escalation dilemma, in one of two orders. Some of the groups were composed of long-time friends (high cohesion); other groups were composed of unacquainted individuals (low cohesion). Further, some were accorded high respect from relevant authorities; in contrast, others were not treated with respect. Groups of friends were more likely to cooperate by contributing to a greater degree in the social dilemma task than were groups of nonfriends. Groups high in cohesion but low in respect were more likely to escalate their commitment to a losing course of action in an escalation dilemma compared to other groups. There appear to be two distinct types of group identity: one based on cohesion and the other based on respect. Cohesion-based identity remained high and relatively constant across the two tasks among groups of friends, but declined over time among groups of nonfriends. Both cohesion-based identity and respect-based identity dropped precipitously following social dilemma tasks, but increased consistently following escalation dilemmas.

"Investigating whether benevolent or universalism value types are more closely related to social value orientations, a survey of 190 undergraduates elicited value priorities, social value orientations and preferences for cooperation in a social dilemma. In analyses of the value priorities a benevolence, a universalism and several individualistic value types were revealed. It was found that the priority ascribed to universalism but not to benevolence values successfully discriminated between participants whose social value orientations were classified as prosocial or proself. Almost as accurately as social value orientations, value priorities predicted preferences for cooperation in the social dilemma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Explored whether cooperation could be promoted by identification with an in-group. A game was used to create 2 groups independent of each other. Thirty-six Japanese undergraduate students participated in the game, followed by a social dilemma game. Analysis revealed a two-factor structure of social identification: identification with the group and identification with its members. As predicted from social identity theory, subjects showed a significantly higher level of cooperation when the dilemma game was played with in-group members than with out-group members. Furthermore, identification with the group affected both in-group bias and cooperative behavior in the social dilemma game, but this effect was not found for identification with members.

It provides a summary of the social psychological literature that defines the relationship between interdependence and the group in terms of 2 perspective: functional interdependence and social identity.

The results of a field study with 135 Papua New Guineans involved in an environmental social dilemma are presented. In the study, functional interdependence was held constant and psychological salience of group boundaries was varied in an attempt to demonstrate the effect of such variable salience on levels of cooperation, as well as on perceptions of interdependence and shared values and needs.

"Examined the effects of own and partner needs for a resource on cooperative behavior in a social dilemma. It was hypothesized that (1) Ss in cohesive groups would make smaller withdrawals when their partners had high need for the resource than when their partners had low need for the resource; and (2) Ss with high own need would make similar withdrawals as those in the low own need conditions. Ss were 54 college students. Own need for a resource was manipulated by creating either high- or low-thirst conditions. Partner need was manipulated by telling Ss that their partner had either high or low thirst. Group cohesion was created by having Ss discuss and solve a winter survival problems and providing success feedback. Ss withdrew gallons of water from a simulated community water well. The amount of water each S acquired at the end of the trials was converted to a corresponding amount of soft drink. The hypothesis was supported. Ss who had the greatest need for the resource perceived their partner as being more honest, trustworthy, and responsible than those who had low resource need.

"Developed and tested the idea that social categorization processes help to explain framing effects in social dilemmas with 128 business students. Using self-categorization theory, the authors predicted that members of a collective would cooperate more when they faced homogeneous rather than heterogeneous resource frames. The starting point of resources for the members of each of 2 subgroups was manipulated, making up a larger collective in a nested social dilemma. The resources of the S's own subgroup started at the individual, subgroup, or collective level, and the resources of the opposing subgroup also started at the individual, subgroup, or collective level. The condition in which both subgroups' resources began at the collective level was similar to a traditional commons dilemma, while the condition in which both subgroups' resources began at the individual level was similar to a traditional public goods problem. Higher allocations to the collective account were found when the initial resource location was the same for both subgroups (vs different for each subgroup), even when this initial location was the subgroup or individual level. Implications for the social categorization processes providing a parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern of allocation are presented.

"Examined how the appearance of a life-like interface agent influenced people's interaction with it, using a social interaction framework of making and keeping promises to cooperate. 96 Ss played a social dilemma game with a human confederate via realtime video conferencing or with 1 of 3 interface agents: a person-like interface agent, a dog-like interface agent, or a cartoon dog interface agent. Technology improvements from a previous version of the human-like interface led to increased cooperation with it; participants made and kept promises to cooperate with the person-like interface agent as much as with the confederate. Dog owners also made and kept promises to dog-like interface agents. General evaluations of likability and appealingness of the interface agent did not lead people to cooperate with it. These findings demonstrate the importance of placing user interface studies within a social interaction framework as interfaces become more social.

"Assessed cultural characteristics of individuals and then related these characteristics to cooperative behavior in social dilemmas. Participants were assessed for their degree of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism, cultural values identified by Triandis (1995). They made choices in either a single-group or an intergroup social dilemma. The single-group dilemma entailed a 3-person dilemma; the intergroup dilemma was identical but added subgroup competition, i.e., an opposing 3-person group. The results indicated an interaction between cultural characteristics and type of dilemma for cooperation. The single-group versus intergroup effect reported by Bornstein and Ben-Yossef (1994) was replicated, but only for vertical individualists. The vertical individualists were least cooperative in the single-group dilemma but were more cooperative in the intergroup dilemma-where cooperation with the group maximized personal outcomes. The vertical collectivists were most cooperative in the single-group dilemma but were less cooperative in the intergroup dilemma where group defection resulted in maximum group outcomes.

"Surveys current research on social dilemmas. A social dilemma arises when actions which are justifiable in terms of individual rationality (e.g., over-harvesting of resources or using private instead of public transportation) threaten the common good and, in the long run, the individual's own self-interest. The study of social dilemmas has links with many areas of psychology, as well as with cognate disciplines such as risk analysis, environmental science, political science, and economics. The organization and contents of this book reflect the most recent trends in the area, including: increased attention to modeling dynamics and processes in social dilemmas; greater emphasis on exploring structural solutions to dilemmas; new findings and theoretical developments regarding group and inter-group processes; and a move from an emphasis on laboratory experiments and game theory to field studies and real-world applications.

"Examined the role of social value orientation in determining the extent to which individuals are inclined to reciprocate cooperation exhibited by others perceived as either honest, intelligent, or unintelligent. 25 Ss' social value orientations were assessed and were subsequently presented with a social dilemma. The Ss were led to believe the other participants had rated high or low in previously administered measures of honesty and intelligence. Results revealed that individuals with prosocial orientation reciprocated high levels of cooperation regardless of other's characteristics. Individuals with proself orientation (i.e., individualists and competitors) exhibited some reciprocal cooperation toward others perceived as honest, yet took advantage of others perceived as intelligent or unintelligent. These results suggest that proselfs can be motivated to reciprocate cooperation by others if they have faith in others' benign intentions and trustworthiness.

"{Public engagement in collaborative natural resource management
necessitates shared understanding and collaboration. Empathic
perspective-taking is a critical facilitator of shared understanding and
positive social interactions, such as collaboration. Yet there is
currently little understanding about how to reliably generate empathic
perspective-taking and collaboration, particularly in situations
involving the unequal distribution of environmental resources or power.
Here we examine how experiencing the loss or gain of social power
influenced empathic perspective-taking and behavior within a computer
mediated scenario. Participants (n = 180) were randomly assigned to each
condition: high resources, low resources, lose resources, gain
resources. Contrary to our expectations, participants in the
perspective-taking condition, specifically those who lost resources,
also lost perspective taking and exhibited egoistic behavior. This
finding suggests that resource control within the collaborative process
is a key contextual variable that influences perspective-taking and
collaborative behavior. Moreover, the observed relationship between
perspective-taking and egoistic behavior within a collaborative resource
sharing exercise suggests that when resource control or access is
unequal, interventions to promote perspective-taking deserve careful
consideration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{Psychological models have been used to simulate emotions within agents
as part of the decision-making process. The body of this work has
focussed on applying the process of decision making using emotions to
social dilemmas, notably the Prisoner's Dilemma. Previous work has
focussed on agents which do not move around, with an initial analysis on
how mobility and the environment can affect the decisions chosen.
Additionally simulated mood has been introduced to the decision-making
process. Exploring simulated emotions and mood to inform the
decision-making process in multi-agent systems allows us to explore in
further detail how outside influences can have an effect on different
strategies. We expand and clarify aspects of how agents are affected by
environmental differences. We show how emotional characters settle on an
outcome without deviation by providing a formal proof. We validate how
the addition of mood increases cooperation, while also showing how small
groups achieve this quicker than large groups. Once pure defectors are
added, to test the resilience of the cooperation achieved, we see that
while agents with a low starting mood achieve a payoff closest to the
pure defectors, they are reduced in numbers the most by the pure
defectors.}"
"{In some important multiplayer situations, such as efforts to supply a
global public good, players can choose the game they want to play. In
this paper we conduct an experimental test of the decision by a group
with fixed membership, playing over a finite number of periods, to
choose between a ``tipping{''} game, in which every player wants to
contribute to the public good provided enough other players contribute,
and a prisoners' dilemma, the classic cooperation game. In the
prisoners' dilemma, the first best outcome is attainable, but cannot be
sustained as a Nash equilibrium. In the tipping game, only a second best
outcome may be attainable, but there exists a Nash equilibrium that is
strictly preferred to the one in the prisoners' dilemma. We show that
many groups persistently choose the prisoners' dilemma despite its
strategic disadvantage, and that the groups that eventually choose the
tipping game do better than the ones that stick with the prisoners'
dilemma.}"
"{Economic games such as the Ultimatum Game (UG) and Prisoner's Dilemma
(PD) are widely used paradigms for studying fairness and cooperation.
Monetary versions of these games involve two players splitting an
arbitrary sum of money. In real life, however, people's propensity to
engage in cooperative behavior depends on their effort and contribution;
factors that are well known to affect perceptions of fairness. We
therefore sought to explore the impact of relative monetary
contributions by players in the UG and PD. Adapted computerized UG and
PD games, in which relative contributions from each player were
manipulated, were administered to 200 participants aged 18-50 years old
(50\% female). We found that players' contribution had large effects on
cooperative behavior. Specifically, cooperation was greater amongst
participants when their opponent had contributed more to joint earnings.
This was manifested as higher acceptance rates and higher offers in the
UG; and fewer defects in the PD compared to when the participant
contributed more. Interestingly, equal contributions elicited the
greatest sensitivity to fairness in the UG, and least frequent defection
in the PD. Acceptance rates correlated positively with anxiety and sex
differences were found in defection behavior. This study highlights the
feasibility of computerized games to assess cooperative behavior and the
importance of considering cooperation within the context of effortful
contribution.}"
"{Often the fuller the reputational record people's actions generate, the
greater their incentive to earn a reputation for cooperation. However,
inability to wipe clean' one's past record might trap some agents who
initially underappreciate reputation's value in a cycle of bad
behaviour, whereas a clean slate could have been followed by their
reforming' themselves. In a laboratory experiment, we investigate what
subjects learn from playing a finitely repeated dilemma game with
endogenous, symmetric partner choice. We find that with a high
cooperation premium and good information, investment in cooperative
reputation grows following exogenous restarts, although earlier end-game
behaviour is observed.}"
"{For environmental problems such as climate change, uncertainty about
future conditions makes it difficult to know what the goal of mitigation
efforts should be, and inequality among the affected parties makes it
hard for them to know how much they each should do toward reaching the
goal. We examine the effects of scientific uncertainty and wealth
inequality in experiments where subjects decide how much to contribute
toward reducing a common threat. We also explore how the framing of
uncertainty affects collective action. Our results suggest that
uncertainty lowers contributions, but contributions remain surprisingly
high even in treatments with a variable loss probability, where such
behavior is individually suboptimal (and where the underlying game is a
prisoner's dilemma). Further, we find that the characterization of
uncertainty is crucial and that inequality need not lower contributions
at all.}"
"{We consider a two-stage model of R\&D/Cournot competition with
isoelastic demand satisfying the cost paradox (i.e., that equilibrium
profits increase with unit cost). The R\&D process has a binary
structure, with spillover effects. We provide a negative answer to the
question in the title: Under noncooperative R\&D, firms will conduct
R\&D for a broad parameter range, despite the presence of the cost
paradox, as a result of being caught in a prisoner's dilemma. A
second-best social planner is shown to have a higher propensity for R\&D
than the noncooperative scenario. However, if firms engaged in any of
the known R\&D cooperation scenarios, the answer to the question in the
title would become affirmative. It follows that R\&D cooperation leads
to lower producer and consumer surpluses. This constitutes a major
departure from the conclusions of the standard R\&D model. Therefore,
R\&D cooperation in such environments should not receive favorable

"{Preserving global public goods, such as the planet's ecosystem, depends
on large-scale cooperation, which is difficult to achieve because the
standard reciprocity mechanisms weaken in large groups. Here we
demonstrate a method by which reciprocity can maintain cooperation in a
large-scale public goods game (PGG). In a first experiment, participants
in groups of on average 39 people play one round of a Prisoner's Dilemma
(PD) with their two nearest neighbours on a cyclic network after each
PGG round. We observe that people engage in ``local-to-global{''}
reciprocity, leveraging local interactions to enforce global
cooperation: Participants reduce PD cooperation with neighbours who
contribute little in the PGG. In response, low PGG contributors increase
their contributions if both neighbours defect in the PD. In a control
condition, participants do not know their neighbours' PGG contribution
and thus cannot link play in the PD to the PGG. In the control we
observe a sharp decline of cooperation in the PGG, while in the
treatment condition global cooperation is maintained. In a second
experiment, we demonstrate the scalability of this effect: in a
1,000-person PGG, participants in the treatment condition successfully
sustain public contributions. Our findings suggest that this simple
``local-to-global{''} intervention facilitates large-scale cooperation.}"
"{We experimentally test the social motives behind individual
participation in intergroup conflict by manipulating the perceived
target of threat-groups or individuals-and the symmetry of conflict. We
find that behavior in conflict depends on whether one is harmed by
actions perpetrated by the out-group, but not on one's own influence on
the outcome of the out-group. The perceived target of threat
dramatically alters decisions to participate in conflict. When people
perceive their group to be under threat, they are mobilized to do what
is good for the group and contribute to the conflict. On the other hand,
if people perceive to be personally under threat, they are driven to do
what is good for themselves and withhold their contribution. The first
phenomenon is attributed to group identity, possibly combined with a
concern for social welfare. The second phenomenon is attributed to a
novel victim effect. Another social motive-reciprocity-is ruled out by
the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"

Ss conformed to others' behavior when they could take from a collective good, but they diffused responsibility and acted contrary to others' behavior when they could give to a public good. Results imply that models of choice behavior in social dilemmas should be expanded to include framing effects, as well as other departures from strict rationality.

"Two types of cooperation can be distinguished in social dilemmas: Elementary cooperation occurs when members cooperate for the benefit of the collectivity; instrumental cooperation occurs when members cooperate to introduce a change in incentive so as to eliminate the dilemma. 192 college students divided into 4-person groups made decisions about individual and group money contributions and about sanctioning. Results of this social dilemma experiment indicate that in the absence of a sanctioning system, greater temptation to defect made the Ss cooperate less fully; however, when opportunities to cooperate in sanctioning existed, greater temptation to defect in the original dilemma made the Ss cooperate more fully for the sanctioning system when the gain for cooperation was large.

The strategies have no memory, effects of reputation do not exist, and defectors cannot be identified, traced, and held responsible for their actions.

"Examined racial discrimination of South African university students using playing strategy in the prisoner's dilemma game as an unobtrusive measure. 30 White men and 30 Black men each played 2 30-trial games, one with a Black confederate and one with a White confederate. In each game, the Ss played against an identical 60% noncontingent strategy. Both the Black and White Ss cooperated to a significantly greater extent with the Black co-player. In the case of the White students, the degree of cooperation was largely determined by motivational orientation, with 7 of the Ss adopting a paternalistic approach that involved deliberate attempt to assist the Black co-player. This finding is interpreted in terms of reverse discrimination. The motivational orientation of the Black students exerted a strong influence on their ratings of the co-player.

"123 female undergraduates and 11 males were assigned as groups or individuals to the communicator role in a prisoner's dilemma conflict with another party, who was described as an individual. Each S was also given a conciliatory, tough, or individualistic assignment by an 'outside' group of constituents the Ss were to represent in the interaction. Ss charged either to be conciliatory or tough were compared with 3 types of groups: all conciliatory, conciliatory/tough, and conciliatory/individualistic. Results show that conciliatory Ss carried out their assignment and were more cooperative in their behavior, promised cooperation more, threatened less, and were more conciliatory in free communication than tough Ss.

"Examined the conditions required to make an aggregate of 3 individuals separately interact with another aggregate of 3 individuals in the competitive manner characteristic of the way in which such groups have been observed to interact with another group of 3 individuals. 454 undergraduates participated in a study in which interactions occurred between 2 aggregates of 3 individuals via 10 versions of a Prisoner's Dilemma Game matrix. In 4 of the 5 conditions (interdependence, contact, discussion, and consensus), each S in 1 aggregate interacted with a single S from the opposing aggregate. In the 5th group-all condition, Ss in each aggregate collectively interacted with Ss in the opposing aggregate.

"In a social dilemma game, a period of discussion among subjects substantially increases the incidence of cooperative choices. We conducted two experiments in an effort to explain this effect. Experiment 1 tested and rejected the hypothesis that discussion of the dilemma problem promotes generalized norms in favor of cooperation. Content analysis of discussion sessions in Experiment 1 suggested that promises to cooperate are important in an explanation of discussion's effect. Experiment 2 showed that promises to cooperate substantially increased cooperation rates, but only when everyone in the discussing group promised. We discuss one model in which discussion promotes group identity (as indicated by consensual promising) and therefore cooperation, and another in which discussion provides an opportunity for promise making, which—at least when it is universal—explains discussion's effect without any involvement of group identity.

"Examines the situation of couples in therapy who remain frozen in noncooperative positions, each insisting that the other make the first move. In order to change this structure, the therapist's priority must be to help shift the attitude of one or both members of the 'stuck' couple from helplessly demanding that the other change to an attitude of feeling empowered to initiate change. A 4-square analysis, similar to the prisoner's dilemma, helps to explain how stalemates occur and points to strategies that can transform the couple's attitudes from helpless complaining to empowered creative action. Three case examples illustrate the clinical applications of this approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The dilemmas involved 66 9-person dilemmas and 64 7-person dilemmas in which Ss had to decide whether to keep or give away a sum of money. Women were only slightly more likely than men to cooperate with others, and variables related to the experimental setting were more important influences on behavior than sex.

Justified inequality and luck-based equality generated low levels of cooperation, whereas justified equality and luck-based inequality generated high levels of cooperation.

Self-set personal goals that were compatible with an assigned group goal led to higher group performance than self-set incompatibly high ('greedy') personal goals. Collective-efficacy in making money, outcome expectancies that cooperation with others leads to the attainment of the group's goal, and group goal commitment correlated positively with group performance. Ss in 7-person groups (N = 28) were less cooperative than those in 3-person groups (N = 26).

"This article draws on social dilemma theory and reference group theory to understand the individual boycott decision and tests the predictions stemming from this conceptualization in 2 experiments. University students participated in the study, and the factors of participation expectation, efficacy, message frame, and substitutability of the boycotted product were manipulated. Consumers' likelihood of participating in both economic and social-issue boycotts is jointly determined by their perceptions of the boycott's likelihood of success, their susceptibility to normative social influences, and the costs they incur in boycotting. Consumers' success perceptions are, in turn, determined by their expectations of overall participation and efficacy, as well as the message frame inherent in pro-boycott communications. 2 key determinants of consumers' boycotting costs are their preference for the boycotted product and their access to its substitutes. More specifically, consumers who are more susceptible to the normative influence exerted by the reference group of potential boycotters are more influenced by expected overall participation rates in their boycott likelihood.

"Examined perceptions of cooperation on a group product (weekly group essay) as a public goods dilemma embedded in a longitudinal study of groups using either face-to-face interaction or computer-mediated communication. 119 undergraduates were separated into 3- or 4-person groups and worked on an individual task and then collaborated on a solution to the task they had worked on individually. Ss then completed a posttask questionnaire assessing feelings toward and perceptions of the group, the group's task performance, and the task itself. Next, Ss wrote individual essays relating the consulting task to course material, followed by group collaboration on an identical assignment. Ss then filled out a postessay questionnaire assessing perceptions of contribution levels toward the group essay.

"Dilemmas are situations in which a person has to choose between maximizing value in the short-term (defection) or maximizing value in the longterm (cooperation). The outcome of a social dilemma is contingent upon more than one person's behavior, whereas, the outcome of an individual dilemma is only contingent upon a single person's behavior over time. These experiments examined the effects of probability of reciprocation and the strategy used by an opponent on levels of cooperation during an individual and a social dilemma. Participants played a dilemma-type game with a computer that controlled the probability of reciprocation. However, for a third of the participants the probability of reciprocation was explicitly signaled, for another third the probability of reciprocation was not signaled, and the remaining third were led to believe that they were playing with another person. In Experiments 1 through 3 probability of reciprocation for both cooperation and defection was set to either 50%, 75%, or 100%. In Experiments 4 through 6 probability of reciprocation was independently set to either 50%, 75%, or 100% for cooperation and defection. The results of Experiments 1 through 6 found a strong positive correlation between probability of reciprocation and levels of cooperation, but this relationship was attenuated when participants believed they were playing another person. In Experiment 7 the computer used either a learning strategy (Pavlov) or a teaching strategy (TFT). When the computer used the learning strategy (Pavlov) it was more likely to repeat its previous choice (cooperate or defect) when a participant reinforced it by cooperating and it was more likely to switch from its previous choice when a participant punished it by defecting. When the computer used the teaching strategy (TFT) it was more likely to reinforce a participant for cooperating by also cooperating and to punish them for defecting by also defecting. Participants generally cooperated with both kinds of strategies when they played with the computer, but were more likely to cooperate at a high level when the computer played according to a learning strategy rather than a teaching strategy when they believed they were playing with another person. Conditions under which people are more likely to cooperate during individual and social dilemmas are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Two hypotheses, formulated using the concept of framing, were proposed in an attempt to understand better the behaviors of cooperators in social dilemmas. The first hypothesis was constructed in response to Schwartz-Shea and Simmon's (1995) criticism on the applicability of the framing concept to explain level of cooperation in public goods and resource dilemmas. It tested the possibility that cooperators may have adopted a different rationality from non-cooperators in a social dilemma situation. The second hypothesis was constructed to explain Cha's (1996) findings. It postulated that penalty sanction has failed to improve cooperation level significantly among the cooperators because cooperators, in contrast to non-cooperators, were not threatened by the sanction. Participants were asked to role-play students in financial difficulty who were offered financial assistance and found themselves in a social dilemma either to accumulate more funds for themselves or to conserve a common fund that was meant to help individuals in similar situations. The task was an iterated social dilemma, structured either as a GS (give-some) game that resembles a public goods dilemma or as a TS (take-some) game that resembles a commons dilemma. Two other factors that were investigated in the study were sanction and social value orientations. Several results inconsistent with previous studies were obtained, the most important of which was the failure to obtain a significant framing effect. Penalty sanction was found to be ineffective for all conditions, while reward sanction was effective only in a TS game but not in a GS game. The inconsistencies in results were traced to the addition of an expenditure factor that was originally intended to only add realism to the task. Implications for the unexpected results were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{Pairs of individuals frequently face situations in which they could do
well if they cooperated, but each risks being exploited. The Prisoner's
Dilemma is widely used for investigating such scenarios, but it is
framed in terms of cooperating and defecting, whereas in reality
cooperation is rarely `all or nothing'. Recent models allowing for
variable investment in cooperation indicated the success of a strategy
of,raising-the-stakes' (RTS), which invests minimally at first and then
increases its investment if its partner matches it. We tested whether
this strategy was adopted by subjects participating in an experiment in
which they could choose how much money to give to a partner, reciprocity
being encouraged by doubling donations. Subjects did increase their
donations over successive rounds, both when playing against a stooge who
reciprocated with the same investment, and when playing with a partner
who was free to choose their investment. Subjects showed a strong
tendency to match variations in their partner's investments. Cooperation
was therefore achieved through a combination of initial escalation (RTS
strategy) and quantitative responsiveness ('give-as-good-as-you-get'
strategy). Although initial offers were higher than predicted, our
results were broadly consistent with theoretical expectations.}"
"{Introduction. The aim of this study is to evaluate cooperation problems
in antisocial disorder with the prisoner's dilemma game, which, in
mathematical game theory, is the paradigm of the <<non-zero>> games
(mutual benefit from cooperation).
Methods. We have designed a computer version of the prisoner's dilemma
(CDT-BD) that confronts the patient to a simulation of a reciprocal
exchange situation. IPDE provided us a categorical and dimensional
evaluation of 26 controls from the community and 40 methadone patients.
Only methadone patients obtained an antisocial diagnosis: 20 in the
category of positive antisocial and 10 in the probable antisocial
category. Patients also fullfilled TCI and MACH-IV.
Results. CDT-BD is, according to the parents opinion (mothers), a good
correlation of real life behavior CDT-BD shows a statistically
significant poorer cooperation of antisocial patients this is
categorical evaluation (versus in controls) and in dimensional
evaluation true both for variables that measure non-cooperation due to
the patient's initiative and those as a response to the computer
provocation. This may be due to a tendency of antisocials to use
interchange situations <<zero game>> strategies (you win what the other
player loses) instead of non-zero games strategies. Non-cooperative
responses are correlated to high scores on the MACH-IV scale
(manipulative behavior and cognition) and revengeful in Treatment and
Character Inventory (TCI).
Conclusions. CDT-BD allows us to generate and test new hypotheses on the
causes of the cooperation problems in antisocial patients using game
theory paradigms.}"
"{Experiments in which subjects play simultaneously several finite
two-person prisoner's dilemma supergames with and without an outside
option reveal that: (i) an attractive outside option enhances
cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game, (ii) if the payoff for
mutual defection is negative, subjects' tendency to avoid losses leads
them to cooperate; while this tendency makes them stick to mutual
defection if its payoff is positive, (iii) subjects use probabilistic
start and endeffect behavior.}"
"{Cooperation based on reciprocal altruism has evolved in only a small
number of species, yet it constitutes the core behavioral principle of
human social life. The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game has been used to
model this form of cooperation. We used fMRI to scan 36 women as they
played an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with another woman to
investigate the neurobiological basis of cooperative social behavior.
Mutual cooperation was associated with consistent activation in brain
areas that have been linked with reward processing: nucleus accumbens,
the caudate nucleus, ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and
rostral anterior cingulate cortex. We propose that activation of this
neural network positively reinforces reciprocal altruism, thereby
motivating subjects to resist the temptation to selfishly accept but not
reciprocate favors.}"
"{This paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest
assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary
thinking. The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to
voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators.
We call this behavioral propensity ``strong reciprocity{''} and show
empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in
circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a
complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are
willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or
who defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a third person. This
suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the
enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or
collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an
adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation
(in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect
reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection
theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.}"

"{We examine whether social preferences are partially determined by
biological factors. We do this by investigating whether digit ratios

and the menstrual cycle is a proxy for contemporary variations in a
range of hormones. We find that digit ratios predict giving in all

good games as well as reciprocity in the trust and ultimatum games vary
significantly over the menstrual cycle. We discuss possible mechanisms
behind these effects and conclude that biological factors play an
important role in shaping social preferences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

"{Altruistic punishment for defectors is considered as a key motive for
the explanation of cooperation. However, there is no clear border
between the cooperative and defective behaviors in a continuous strategy
game. We propose a model to study the effect of punishment on the
evolution of cooperation in continuous public goods game, wherein
individuals have the traits to punish the co-players based on social
tolerance. We show that a reasonable punishment with a uniform tolerance
can spur individuals to make more investments. Additionally, for a fixed
punishment cost and a fixed fine, a moderate value of tolerance can
result in the best promotion of cooperation. Furthermore, we investigate
the coevolutionary dynamics of investment and tolerance. We find that
the population splits into two branches: high-tolerance individuals who
make high investments and low-tolerance individuals who make low
investments. A dynamic equilibrium is achieved between these two types
of individuals. Our work extends punishment to continuous cooperative
behaviors and the results may enhance the understanding of altruistic
punishment in the evolution of human cooperation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

as self-reported donations and volunteering outside the lab. At the same
time, choices vary systematically by individual characteristics and

underlying stable social preference and for the role of context in
influencing the expression of that preference.}"

"{There is a growing interest for the determinants of human choice
behavior in social settings. Upon initial contact, investment choices in
social settings can be inherently risky, as the degree to which the
other person will reciprocate is unknown. Nevertheless, people have been
shown to exhibit prosocial behavior even in one-shot laboratory settings
where all interaction has been taken away. A logical step has been to
link such behavior to trait empathy-related neurobiological networks.
However, as a social interaction unfolds, the degree of uncertainty with
respect to the expected payoff of choice behavior may change as a
function of the interaction. Here we attempt to capture this factor. We
show that the interpersonal tie one develops with another person during
interaction rather than trait empathy motivates investment in a public
good that is shared with an anonymous interaction partner. We examined
how individual differences in trait empathy and interpersonal ties
modulate neural responses to imposed monetary sharing. After, but not
before interaction in a public good game, sharing prompted activation of
neural systems associated with reward (striatum), empathy (anterior
insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) as well as altruism, and
social significance {[}posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)].
Although these activations could be linked to both empathy and
interpersonal ties, only tie-related pSTS activation predicted prosocial
behavior during subsequent interaction, suggesting a neural substrate
for keeping track of social relevance.}"
"{Whereas altruism drives the evolution of human cooperation,
ethno-religious diversity has been considered to obstruct it, leading to
poverty, corruption, and war. We argue that current research has failed
to properly account for the institutional environment and how it affects
the role diversity plays. The emergence of thriving, diverse communities
throughout human history suggests that diversity does not always lead to
cooperation breakdown. We conducted experiments in Mostar,
Bosnia-Herzegovina with Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks at a
critical historic moment in the city's postwar history. Using a public
goods game, we found that the ability to sanction is key to achieving
cooperation in ethno-religiously diverse groups, but that sanctions
succeed only in integrated institutional environments and fail in
segregated ones. Hence, we show experimentally for the first time in a
real-life setting that institutions of integration can unleash human
altruism and restore cooperation in the presence of diversity.}"
"{Psychological game theory can provide rational-choice-based framing
effects; frames influence beliefs, beliefs influence motivations. We
explain this theoretically and explore empirical relevance

that frames affect subject's first- and second-order beliefs and
contributions. From a psychological game-theoretic framework we derive
two mutually compatible hypotheses about guilt aversion and reciprocity
under which contributions are related to second- and first-order
beliefs, respectively. Our results are consistent with either. (C) 2011

"{When truth conflicts with efficiency, can verbal communication destroy
efficiency? are lies or vagueness used to hide inconvenient truths? We
consider a sequential player public good game in which the leader has
private information about the value of the public good. This value can
be low, high, or intermediate, the latter case giving rise to a
prisoners' dilemma. Without verbal communication, efficiency is
achieved, wit contributions for high or intermediate values. When verbal
communication is added, the leader has an incentive to hide the precise
truth when the value is intermediate. the! show experimentally that,
when communication must be precise, the leader frequent lies, preserving
efficiency by exaggerating. When communication can be vague, the leader
turns to vague messages when the value is intermediate. Thus, she
implicitly reveals a values. Interestingly, efficiency is preserved,
since the follower does not seem to realize that vague messages hide

"{Recent studies argue that cross-cultural variation in human cooperation
supports cultural group selection models of the evolution of large-scale
cooperation. However, these studies confound cultural and environmental
differences between populations by predominantly sampling one population
per society. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral variation
between populations is driven by environmental differences in demography
and ecology. We use a public goods game played with money and a
naturalistic measure of behavior involving the distribution of salt, an
essential and locally valued resource, to demonstrate significant
variation in levels of cooperation across 16 discrete populations of the
same small-scale society, the Pahari Korwa of central India. Variation
between these populations of the same cultural group is comparable to
that found between different cultural groups in previous studies.
Demographic factors partly explain this variation; age and a measure of
social network size are associated with contributions in the public
goods game, while population size and the number of adult sisters
residing in the population are associated with decisions regarding salt.
That behavioral variation is at least partly contingent on environmental
differences between populations questions the existence of stable norms
of cooperation. Hence, our findings call for reinterpretation of
cross-cultural data on cooperation. Although cultural group selection
could theoretically explain the evolution of large-scale cooperation,
our results make clear that existing cross-cultural data cannot be taken
as empirical support for this hypothesis.}"
"{Cooperation, where one individual incurs a cost to help another, is a
fundamental building block of the natural world and human society. It
has been suggested that costly punishment can promote the evolution of
cooperation, with the threat of punishment deterring free-riders. Recent
experiments, however, have revealed the existence of `antisocial'
punishment, where non-cooperators punish cooperators. While various
theoretical models find that punishment can promote the evolution of
cooperation, these models a priori exclude the possibility of antisocial
punishment. Here we extend the standard theory of optional public goods
games to include the full set of punishment strategies. We find that
punishment no longer increases cooperation, and that selection favours
substantial levels of antisocial punishment for a wide range of
parameters. Furthermore, we conduct behavioural experiments, showing
results consistent with our model predictions. As opposed to an
altruistic act that promotes cooperation, punishment is mostly a
self-interested tool for protecting oneself against potential
competitors.}"

"{We report data from public goods games showing that
privately-implemented punishment reduces cooperation in relation to a
baseline treatment without punishment. When that same incentive is
implemented publicly, however, cooperation is sustained at significantly
higher rates than in either the baseline or private punishment

attributable to shame, differences in information or signaling. Rather,
our evidence is that the ability to observe the punishment of
low-contributors can reverse punishment's detrimental effects. This
result has important efficiency implications for the design of
mechanisms intended to deter misconduct. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

inequality aversion using a within-subject design. We run four different

"{Altruistic punishment may promote cooperation, but can also lead to
costly feuds. We examine how the threat of feuds affects individuals'
willingness to engage in altruistic punishment in a public good
experiment in which the number of stages is determined by participants'
actions. The design imposes minimal restrictions on who can punish whom
and when, and therefore allows participants to use a range of punishment
strategies. We find that participants recognize the threat of feuds and
respond to it by employing strategies that prevent their breakout. When
feuds can span several periods, the extent of altruistic punishment is
greatly reduced. This leads to progressively lower levels of cooperation
and earnings relative to a baseline treatment where punishment cannot be

less to this household common pool than men and opportunism is
widespread. These results cast doubts on many models of household
decision making. Experimental results are correlated with socio-economic
attributes and suggest that assortative matching improves household
efficiency. Developing non-cooperative household models sensitive to the
context-specificity of gender relations emerges as a promising future
research agenda. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{Previous research offers compelling evidence that leaders suffice to
effect efficiency-enhancements on cooperation, yet the source of this
effect remains unclear. To investigate whether leadership effects can be
attributed exclusively to the common information that leaders provide to
a group, irrespective of the source of that information, we design a
public goods game in which non-binding contribution suggestions
originate with either a human or computer leader. We find that group
members' decisions are significantly influenced by human leaders'
non-binding contribution suggestions, both when the leader is elected as
well as when the leader is randomly chosen. A leader's suggestion
becomes an upper bound for group member's contributions. Identical
suggestions do not impact the group members' decisions when they
originate with a computer, thus supporting to the view that information
provided by human leaders is uniquely able to establish
welfare-enhancing norms. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Subjects play a 5-person Prisoner's Dilemma both from an impartial point
of view and in a regular fashion to determine whether 1) Concerns for
fairness increase cooperative behavior; 2) Play of a Prisoner's Dilemma
from an impartial point of view results in significantly higher levels
of cooperation than does normal play; 3) Concern for fairness has
greater explanatory force in explaining cooperation in impartial plays
of the Prisoner's Dilemma than in normal plays; and 4) Experience with
impartial play of a Prisoner's Dilemma sensitizes subjects to normative
imperatives and results in higher levels of cooperation in subsequent
normal plays of Prisoner's Dilemmas. The first and second hypotheses are
supported, the third is inverted, and the fourth is not supported.
Concern for fairness is demonstrated to play a complex role in
explaining cooperative behavior in regular plays of the game.}"
"{The present study aimed to identify the factors that have an impact on
the reduction of destructivity of divorce in Buenos Aires. For that
purpose, a random sample of 27 families was drawn from four local family
courts. The independent variables in the study belonged to three levels:
(1) the partners, (2) the couple and the family, and (3) the court and
the judge. For the individuals, the MMPI-2, the Interview of Destructive
Divorce, and the Prisoner's Dilemma were used. The court and the judge
were studied by means of the Prisoner's Dilemma, a Social Climate Scale,
a Judge's Resources Inventory, and a Questionnaire of Work with the
Family. After reducing data by principal components analyses, multiple
regressions were carried out. The data analysis indicated that judge and
court environmental factors, as well as interactive intra-family factors
had a strong impact on family improvement, whereas individual illness or
psychopathology was unimportant. Improvement is larger when a high score
of initial destructivity, a task-oriented court climate and a judge who
is formal and afiliative.}"
"{Cooperation is central to collective management of small-scale fisheries
management, including marine protected areas. Thus an understanding of
the factors influencing stakeholders' propensity to cooperate to achieve
shared benefits is essential to accomplishing successful collective
fisheries management. In this paper we study stakeholders' cooperative
behavioral disposition and elucidate the role of various socio-economic
factors in influencing it in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon
Islands. We employed a Public Goods Game from experimental economics
tailored to mimic the problem of common pool fisheries management to
elucidate peoples' cooperative behavior. Using Ostrom's framework for
analyzing social-ecological systems to guide our analysis, we examined
how individual-scale variables (e.g., age, education, family size,
ethnicity, occupational status, personal norms), in the context of
village-scale variables (e.g., village, governance institutions, group
coercive action), influence cooperative behavior, as indexed by game
contribution. Ostrom's framework provides an effective window for
conceptually peeling back the various socio-economic and governance
layers which influence cooperation within these communities. The results
of our research show that the most important resource user
characteristics influencing cooperative behavior were age, occupation
and beliefs about giving access to others to fish for commercial gain.
Through elucidating the factors affecting stakeholders' propensity to
cooperate to achieve shared benefits, our analysis provides guidance in
understanding cooperation in relation to collective management of marine
resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}"
"{Prior experimental studies on tax evasion generally assume that the
budget and the probability of audit are exogenously given, and ignore
taxpayers' incentives to detect evasion and their compliance behaviour
under such incentives. The experimental evidence of the present paper
shows that, on average, subjects are willing to spend 20 to 30\% of
their tax revenue on auditing. Compliance is also greatly improved if
subjects can determine the budget and, hence, the probability of audit.
These findings suggest that taking taxpayers' incentives to detect
evasion into consideration is important for the design of
compliance-improvement audit schemes.}"
"{Abstract
We compare communication about private information to communication
about actions in a one-shot 2-person public good game with private
information. The informed player, who knows the exact return from
contributing and whose contribution is unobserved, can send a message
about the return or her contribution. Theoretically, messages can elicit
the uninformed player's contribution, and allow the informed player to
free-ride. The exact language used is not expected to matter.
Experimentally, however, we find that free-ride depends on the language:
the informed player free-rides less-and thereby lies less
frequently-when she talks about her contribution than when she talks
about the return. Further experimental evidence indicates that it is the
promise component in messages about the contribution that leads to less
free-ride and less lying.}"
"{We report the results of an experiment investigating the provision of a
step-level collective good. This experiment compares the behavior of
subjects in a public good game with the behavior of subjects in a club
good game. In the club good game, players who do not contribute the
membership fee are excluded from the consumption of the collective good.
The introduction of a small membership fee has surprisingly strong
effects: it increases the provision of the collective good, delays
provision failures and increases the number of contributors. The
experiment also reveals the limits of the introduction of a small fee.
At a high threshold level, the membership fee no longer ensures
successful provision.}"
"{In this paper, we test the effect of normative expectations and legal
framing on cooperation in an experimental public good game with and
without sanctions. We show that cooperation increases substantially as
normative expectations and behavioral patterns coevolve. In the absence
of sanctions, legal framing does not have any additional beneficial
effect in realigning individual action and social well-being. Yet, in
the presence of sanctions, the legal frame is crucial for the
effectiveness of sanctions. Law and sanctions seem to complement each
other. Our results inform the legal debate on customary law.}"

"{Commons dilemmas are interaction situations where a common good is
provided or exploited by a group of individuals so that optimal
collective outcomes clash with private interests. Although in these
situations, social norms and institutions exist that might help
individuals to cooperate, little is known about the interaction effects
between positive and negative incentives and exit options by
individuals. We performed a modified public good game experiment to
examine the effect of exit, rewards and punishment, as well as the
interplay between exit and rewards and punishment. We found that
punishment had a stronger effect than rewards on cooperation if
considered by itself, whereas rewards had a stronger effect when
combined with voluntary participation. This can be explained in terms of
the `framing effect', i.e., as the combination of exit and rewards might
induce people to attach higher expected payoffs to cooperative
strategies and expect better behaviour from others.}"
"{Collective rituals have long puzzled anthropologists, yet little is
known about how rituals affect participants. Our study investigated the
effects of nine naturally occurring rituals on prosociality. We
operationalized prosociality as (1) attitudes about fellow ritual
participants and (2) decisions in a public goods game. The nine rituals
varied in levels of synchrony and levels of sacred attribution. We found
that rituals with synchronous body movements were more likely to enhance
prosocial attitudes. We also found that rituals judged to be sacred were
associated with the largest contributions in the public goods game. Path
analysis favored a model in which sacred values mediate the effects of
synchronous movements on prosocial behaviors. Our analysis offers the
first quantitative evidence for the long-standing anthropological
conjecture that rituals orchestrate body motions and sacred values to
support prosociality. Our analysis, moreover, adds precision to this old
conjecture with evidence of a specific mechanism: ritual synchrony
increases perceptions of oneness with others, which increases sacred
values to intensify prosocial behaviors.}"
"{Background: Cooperation is necessary in many types of human joint
activity and relations. Evidence suggests that cooperation has direct
and indirect benefits for the cooperators. Given how beneficial
cooperation is overall, it seems relevant to investigate the various
ways of enhancing individuals' willingness to invest in cooperative
endeavors. We studied whether ascription of a transparent collective
goal in a joint action promotes cooperation in a group.
Methods: A total of 48 participants were assigned in teams of 4
individuals to either a ``transparent goal-ascription'' or an ``opaque
goal-ascription'' condition. After the manipulation, the participants
played an anonymous public goods game with another member of their team.
We measured the willingness of participants to cooperate and their
expectations about the other player's contribution.
Results: Between subjects analyses showed that transparent goal
ascription impacts participants' likelihood to cooperate with each other
in the future, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social
interactions. Further analysis showed that this could be explained with
a change in expectations about the partner's behavior and by an
emotional alignment of the participants.
Conclusion: The study found that a transparent goal ascription is
associated with an increase of cooperation. We propose several
high-level mechanisms that could explain the observed effect: general
affect modulation, trust, expectation and perception of collective
efficacy.}"
"{We experimentally investigate simultaneous decision-making in two
contrasting environments: one that encourages competition (lottery
contest) and one that encourages cooperation (public good game). We find
that simultaneous participation in the public good game affects behavior
in the contest, decreasing sub-optimal overbidding. Contributions to the
public good are not affected by participation in the contest. The
direction of behavioral spillover is explained by differences in
strategic uncertainty and path-dependence across games. Our design
allows us to compare preferences for cooperation and competition. We
find that in early periods, there is a negative correlation between
decisions in competitive and in cooperative environments. (JEL C72, C91)}"
"{In this article, we use a new game-based tool to evaluate the immediate
and longer term behavioral change potential of three different payments
for ecosystem services (PES) delivery mechanisms: direct payments for
individual performance, direct payments for group performance, and
insurance. Results from four rural shifting-cultivation dependent
communities in Lao PDR suggest that easily understood group-oriented
incentives yield the greatest immediate resource-use reduction and
experience less free-riding. Group-based incentives may succeed because
they motivate participants to communicate about strategies and
coordinate their actions and are perceived as fair. No incentive had a
lasting effect after it ceased, but neither did any crowd out the
participants' baseline behavior. Temporary reductions in resource
dependence may provide a buffer for development of new livelihoods and
longer term change. Games like the one developed here can help policy
makers appropriately target environmental incentive programs to local
contexts and teach program participants how incentive schemes work.}"
"{Sustained cooperative social interactions are key to successful outcomes
in many real-world contexts (e.g., climate change and energy
conservation). We explore the self-regulatory roles of anger and guilt,
as well as prosocial or selfish social preferences in a repeated social
dilemma game framed around shared electricity use at home. We explore
the proposal that for sustained cooperation, guilty repair needs to
override angry retaliation. We show that anger is damaging to
cooperation as it leads to retaliation and an increase of defection,
while, through guilt, cooperation is repaired resulting in higher levels
of cooperation. We demonstrate a disconnect between the experience of
anger and subsequent retaliation which is a function of participants'
social preferences. While there is no difference in reports of anger
between prosocial and selfish individuals after finding out that others
use more energy from the communal resource, prosocials are less likely
to act on their anger and retaliate. Selfish individuals are motivated
by anger to retaliate but not motivated by guilt to repair and
contribute disproportionately to the breakdown of cooperation over
repeated interactions. We suggest that guilt is a key emotion to appeal
to when encouraging cooperation.}"
"{This paper draws on institutional and experimental economics to
investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous rules in irrigation
systems. The hypotheses we examine argue that despite the differences
between socio-economic and political settings, (1) endogenous
rule-crafting can help water users to overcome appropriation and
provision dilemmas in water-scarce environments like in the East
Mediterranean countries and that (2) in market-like water governance
systems, institutions other than the market itself, are less influential
for overcoming appropriation and provision dilemmas than in hybrid
governance systems. These hypotheses are being tested comparing the
results of field experiments conducted in Jordan, the Republic of Cyprus
and North Cyprus with 70 farmers. Field experiments simulate asymmetric
access to resources and are based on variations of the irrigation game
by Cardenas et al. to model and test asymmetric distribution of
investment, harvest and revenue that favours upstream users. Empirical
evidence shows that externally imposed allocation rules are able to
bring in more equal distribution of revenue among upstream-downstream
users but is likely to reduce the volume of investment and revenue,
without resolving issues of free-riding. The authors argue that given
the opportunity, water users (small farmers in our experiments) are able
to craft their own rules improving the overall performance of the group
in terms of investment and revenue, with a parallel improvement of
equity in distribution. The implications and policy relevance of such
findings are briefly discussed as they contradict typical practices of
top-down policy delivery in the selected cases.}"
"{In this paper, we model social preferences as a function of the skewness
of the distribution of initial endowments. Skewness is a measure of the
asymmetry of the distribution of endowments around the mean. We argue
that skewness reflects the social distance between `elite' players with
high initial endowments and other players with lower endowments, better
than variance and concentration measures like the Gini-coefficient. We
hypothesize that elite players become more selfish with increasing
skewness and therefore contribute less to a public good in the framework
of a one-shot non-linear public good game. The results of an
experimental test, in which we systematically vary the distribution of
endowments between treatments, confirm that the model is able to
correctly explain the observed pattern of contribution behavior. We find
that cooperation and efficiency are lowest with right-skewed
distribution of endowments. Our paper therefore improves the
understanding of the behavioral link between inequality and efficiency.

"{There are many contexts in which an ``everybody else is doing it{''}
attitude is relevant. We evaluate the impact of this attitude in a
multithreshold public goods game. We use a lab experiment to study the
role of providing information about contribution behavior to targeted
subsets of individuals, and its effect on coordination. Treatments
include one in which no information is provided and three other
treatments, i.e., where information is provided to a random sample of
subjects; to those whose contributions are below the average of their
group, and to those whose contributions are above the average of their
group. We find that the random provision of information is no different
than not providing information. More important, average contributions
improve with targeted treatments. Coordination waste is also lower with
targeted treatments. The insights from this research are more broadly
relevant in the contexts of piracy, open innovation, and crowdfunding.}"
"{Green goods such as recycled paper stationary or carbon-neutral flights
provide increasingly popular examples of impure public goods. Motivated
by theoretical treatments of green goods as a bundle of private and
public characteristics in proportions fixed by the provider, we design
an experiment with two linked treatments to test how the presence of
impure public goods affects behaviour towards public good causes. We set
parameters, such that from a standard economic perspective the presence
of the impure public good is behaviourally irrelevant. In a treatment
where the impure public good provides only small contributions to the
public good, we observe that on aggregate pro-social behaviour is lower
in the presence of the impure public good. On the contrary, in the
treatment where the impure public good is more generous towards the
public good component at the expense of private earnings, individuals
are unaffected in their behaviour. We observe that impure public goods,
that are theoretically irrelevant and are mostly self-interested, may
hinder pro-social behaviour and look for explanations in social
psychology, such as the phenomenon of thoughtful anchoring, motivated
reasoning and reluctant altruism. The results from this experiment
question the role of green goods in enhancing environmentally friendly
behaviours.}"

as a public good game with heterogeneous remuneration. In a
hierarchically organized firm, team leaders (allocators) determine the

team production, but when the allocator receives only half of what the
other workers receive, team production is diminished.}"
"{We introduce two institutions that provide multiple public good units,
assuming that a market-maker has the ability to establish groups of
contributors. We set up an experiment where either all N individuals
form one group to provide two units (aggregated approach), or divide the
N participants into two groups, and each group provides one unit
separately, with all individuals benefiting from any unit(s) provided

approach produces higher contributions on average. We also find that the
rebate of excess contributions has a larger influence in increasing
contribution under the aggregated approach.}"
"{We study how leader compensation affects public goods provision. We
report from a lab experiment with four treatments, where the base
treatment was a standard public goods game with simultaneous
contribution decisions, and the three other treatments allowed
participants to volunteer to be the leader in their group and make their
contribution before the others. In the three leader treatments, we
manipulated the level of compensation given to the leader. Our main
finding is that a moderate compensation to the leader is beneficial; it
increases the average contribution relative to both a situation where
the leader is not compensated and a situation without a leader. A
further increase in the leader compensation, however, is detrimental to
public goods provision; it attracts more free riders and creates a
social crowding-out effect. Finally, we report from a survey showing
that the social crowding-out effect is also present in the population at
large. We argue that the main findings of the paper are important in
many real-life settings where we would like to use economic incentives
to encourage people to lead by example.}"
"{Are larger groups better at cooperation than smaller groups? This paper
investigates, under controlled conditions, the presence and direction of
a possible group size effect in pure public good provision by large
heterogeneous groups. Employing subjects drawn from the general
population and introducing Internet-based procedures to study this
question, we collected experimental evidence from 1110 subjects playing
a linear public goods game in groups of 10, 40, and 100 members. We find
a positive and significant group size effect: Increasing group size by a
factor of 10 (4) increased efficiency by 10 (6) percent. The effect
arose at the intensive margin and with repetition. Those who contributed
contributed more in larger groups. Larger and smaller groups had similar
initial contribution levels, but cooperation rates declined more slowly
in the larger groups. Free-riding was invariant to group size, despite
subjects' persistent beliefs of a negative group size effect at the
extensive margin. Further econometric examination of the data supports
these findings and provides starting points for future theoretical and
experimental research on the group size effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"{Attention to factors influencing cooperation and competition during
human social interaction has increased within recent years. This study
tested the hypothesis that higher levels of cooperation would be
associated with increased genetic relatedness between interactants, and
explored questions concerning the expression of cooperative behavior
over time. A Prisoner's Dilemma game, in which participants elect to
display cooperative, competitive, or exploitative behaviors relative to
a partner, was administered to 59 monozygotic and 37 dizygotic twin
pairs, between 10.92 and 82.67 years of age. Results from multivariate
analysis of variance procedures, cross-lag sequential analyses, and
hierarchical linear modeling supported associations between zygosity,
and frequency and continuity of cooperation. Mechanisms by which
zygosity may affect cooperation were explored by examining relationships
between response combinations, and twins' IQ similarity and social
closeness. The findings are considered with reference to an evolutionary
perspective on behavior that offers a theoretical basis for considering
how the relative genetic relatedness of social partners affects their
social-interactional processes and outcomes. This report is the first in
a series of studies designed to address mechanisms underlying
differences in cooperation among pairs who vary in average genetic
commonality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.}"
"{Communication increases contributions to public goods. Our experimental
results indicate that communication is not always required. Silent
identification suffices to raise solidarity in prisoner's dilemma and
dictator games. Increases in solidarity are not only due to expectations
of reciprocity. While mutual identification induces individuals to
converge to the social norm, the spread of the distribution of choices
increases with one-way identification and with communication. As others
are no longer faceless entities, one-way identification decreases social
distance, inducing interaction-specific solutions. Communication allows
more information to be transferred and, therefore, more scope for
abandoning the norms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

"{Many problems in human society reflect the inability of selfish parties

cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Rigorous empirical
tests, however, lag behind the progress made by theorists, Clear
predictions differ depending on the players' capacity to remember

cooperative strategies predicted, ne asked students to play the iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma game either continuously or interrupted after each
round by a secondary memory task (i,e,, playing the game ``Memory{''})

without interruption, most students used ``Pavlovian{''} strategies, as
predicted, for greater memory capacity, and the rest used ``generous
tit-for-tat{''} strategies. The proportion of generous tit-for-tat
strategies increased when games of Memory interfered with the subjects'
working memory, as predicted, Students who continued to use complex
Pavlovian strategies mere less successful in the Memory game, but more
successful in the Prisoner's Dilemma, which indicates a trade-off in
memory capacity for the two tasks, Our results suggest that the set of

"We examine motivators for contributing to a real-life public good. We conduct fundraising experiments where the contributions are dedicated to the procurement of sustainable supplies for two colleges' (religious and non-religious) synagogues and a VCM experiment. Our findings suggest that contributions to real-life public goods are motivated by the level of utilization in the public good, peer effect, the actual participation in an experiment and cooperation. In addition, we find that religious females contribute more than religious males. Finally, we derive practical implications from our findings.

This paper investigates the formation of a central authority regime within a linear public good experiment. The institution is funded by a fixed cost that increases with the level of deterrence, which is specified as the number of group members who are likely to be monitored. The level of deterrence is both exogenously and endogenously determined, allowing investigation of the effect of endogenous selection. The results indicate no significant positive endogenous selection effect. Indeed, in contrast to the existing literature, when a non-deterrent central authority is endogenously determined contributions tend to decrease.

"Public good contributions have been an interest for many experimental economists, since evidence has shown that people do not always behave rationally and inefficient equilibria are not always realized. This research compares a public good game run in both China and Germany with three treatments in which the social distance factor varies. The outcome shows that under a condition of high social distance, Chinese and German behavior differs with German subjects contributing more to the public good. As social distance decreases, both samples converge to insignificantly different averages of contribution. It is also found that people’s contribution is positively correlated with their guess and level of anonymity: the more their identity is exposed, the more they give and the more they believe the other is giving.

The voluntary participation game consists of two stages: a non-cooperative participation decision followed by Coasian bargaining on public goods provision only among those who choose to participate. Our experimental findings show that, consistent with the theoretical findings of Dixit and Olson, the outcome of this game falls short of full efficiency. However, we find that voluntary participation undermines the Coase Theorem to a lesser extent than predicted by Dixit and Olson, particularly with larger numbers of players. We also investigate the effect of pre-play communication on the public goods provision and find little evidence that cheap talk helps subjects coordinate on the efficient outcome of coalition formation in the laboratory.

"People contribute more to public goods when their contributions are made more observable to others. We report an intervention that subtly increases the observability of public goods contributions when people are solicited privately and impersonally (e.g., mail, email, social media). This intervention is tested in a large-scale field experiment (n = 770,946) in which people are encouraged to vote through get-out-the-vote letters. We vary whether the letters include the message, 'We may call you after the election to ask about your voting experience.' Increasing the perceived observability of whether people vote by including that message increased the impact of the get-out-the-vote letters by more than the entire effect of a typical get-out-the-vote letter. This technique for increasing perceived observability can be replicated whenever public goods solicitations are made in private. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"This dissertation work consists of three essays on information disclosure mechanisms, information preferences, and private provision of public goods. In Chapter 1, 'Green, Greener, Greenest: Eco-label Gradation and Competition' I examine two common features of markets in which eco-label programs certify that products are 'green': gradation---single programs offering multiple certification standards (e.g., platinum, gold, silver)---and competition---multiple programs vying to certify to their respective standards. I find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry groups, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. For each of the cases examined, my analysis is consistent with casual empirical evidence. In Chapter 2, 'Is Ignorance Bliss? Information Avoidance and Private Provision of Public Goods', I investigate how information should be provided, and how individuals' information preferences can affect their private provision of public goods. I build a theoretical model that delivers several key findings: (1) Even if complete information about how much their efforts contribute to the public good can be acquired costlessly, individuals may still choose to avoid such information; (2) If policymakers are unaware of such behavior, they may adopt policies that yield suboptimal provision of public goods; (3) Forcing such information on individuals may yield a coordination failure, resulting in suboptimal public good provision and decreased welfare. In Chapter 3, 'An Experimental Test of Willingness-to-Pay for the Resolution of Uncertainty', I conduct an economic experiment to examine whether people's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an environmental public good can be affected by the timing and degree of uncertainty resolution. We extend conventional expected utility theory by combining anticipatory-utility-theory framework and neuroeconomic findings. I derive two sets of predictions about people's WTP under different information treatments using conventional expected utility theory and anticipatory utility theory. The experiment results are more consistent with anticipatory utility theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Business schools around the world must prepare their students for two realities: operating in an English-speaking business world and working in teams. As yet. there is limited understanding of how operating in a native or a foreign language impacts students' propensity to free ride in group settings. Building on general dual process theory of higher cognition and using a unique dataset of 276 Dutch business school students, we find that students are more inclined to free ride in a foreign language setting than in a native language setting. A student's conscientiousness attenuates this relationship such that this effect is stronger for students who are less conscientious, and weaker and almost absent for those who are more conscientious. After a student decides not to free ride but to positively contribute to the group, the specific level of contribution is not affected by foreign language. We discuss implications for practice, policy, theory, and future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"A unique feature of adolescent social re-orientation is heightened sensitivity to peer influence when taking risks. However, positive peer influence effects are not yet well understood. The present fMRI study tested a novel hypothesis, by examining neural correlates of prosocial peer influence on donation decisions in adolescence. Participants (age 12–16 years; N = 61) made decisions in anonymous groups about the allocation of tokens between themselves and the group in a public goods game. Two spectator groups of same-age peers—in fact youth actors—were allegedly online during some of the decisions. The task had a within-subjects design with three conditions: (1) Evaluation: spectators evaluated decisions with likes for large donations to the group, (2) Spectator: spectators were present but no evaluative feedback was displayed and (3) Alone: no spectators nor feedback. Results showed that prosocial behavior increased in the presence of peers, and even more when participants received evaluative feedback from peers. Peer presence resulted in enhanced activity in several social brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus and superior temporal sulcus. TPJ activity correlated with donations, which suggests similar networks for prosocial behavior and sensitivity to peers. These findings highlight the importance of peers in fostering prosocial development throughout adolescence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Several studies have shown that social identity fosters the provision of public goods and enhances the willingness to reciprocate the cooperative behavior of group members. Nonetheless, the question of how social identity affects negative reciprocity in identity-homogeneous and -heterogeneous groups has only received little attention. Consequently, we seek to fill this gap by examining whether social identity affects individuals’ willingness to sanction deviating group members in a public good context. Moreover, we devote particular attention to the role of anger-like emotions in negative reciprocity. To test our hypotheses, we employ one-shot public good games in a strategy method with punishment opportunity and induced social identity. Our results indicate that members of identity-homogeneous groups are prone to reveal less negative reciprocity than identity-heterogeneous groups when they face contributions smaller than their own. We also find that anger-like emotions much more strongly influence punishment behavior when individuals are matched with members of different identities than in identity-homogenous groups. These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the nature of social identity and its impact on reciprocity, improving economists’ ability to predict behavior while taking emotions into consideration.

"The findings of the tax literature suggest that the mechanism how tax revenues are redistributed has an important influence on tax compliance. One conjecture is that if the redistribution mechanism is perceived as positive by the taxpayers, this leads them to comply with the tax laws more truthfully. In contrast, for a negative perception, lower tax compliance is expected. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study systematically analyzing these effects. To fill this gap, we conduct a laboratory experiment and analyze how the redistribution of tax revenues influences tax compliance behavior by applying different reward mechanisms. In our experiment, subjects have to make two decisions. In the first stage, subjects decide on the contribution to a public good. In the second stage, subjects declare their income from the first stage for taxation. Our main results are threefold: First, from an aggregated perspective, rewards have a negative overall effect on tax compliance. Second, we observe that rewards affect the decision of taxpayers asymmetrically. In particular, rewards have either no effect (for those who are rewarded) or a negative effect (for those who are not rewarded) on tax compliance. Thus, if a high compliance rate of taxpayers is preferred, rewards should not be used by the tax authority. Third, we find an inverse u-shaped relationship between public good contribution and tax compliance. In particular, up to a certain level, tax compliance increases with subjects’ own contributions to the public good. Above this level, however, tax compliance decreases with the public good contribution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{This study examines data drawn from the game show Friend or Foe? which
is similar to the classic prisoner's dilemma tale: partnerships are
endogenously determined, and players work together to earn money, after
which they play a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game over large stakes:
varying from \$200 to (potentially) more than \$22,000. The data reveal
several interesting insights; perhaps most provocatively, they suggest
that even though the game is played in front of an audience of millions
of viewers, some of the evidence is consistent with a model of
discrimination. The observed patterns of social discrimination are
unanticipated, however.}"
"{Explaining cooperation is one of the greatest challenges for
evolutionary biology {[}1-3]. It is particularly a problem in species
such as humans, where there is cooperation between nonrelatives.
Numerous possible solutions have been suggested for the problem of
cooperation between nonrelatives, including punishment, policing, and
various forms of reciprocity {[}3-14]. Here, we suggest that local
competition for resources can pose a problem for these hypotheses,
analogous to how it can select against cooperation between relatives
{[}15-21]. We extend the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game to show that local
competition between interacting individuals can reduce selection for
cooperation between nonrelatives. This is because, with local
competition, fitness is relative to social partners, and cooperation
benefits social partners. We then test whether nonrelated humans adjust
their level of cooperation facultatively in response to the scale of
competition when playing the PD for cash prizes. As predicted, we found
that individuals were less likely to cooperate when competition was
relatively local. Cooperation between humans will therefore be most
likely when repeated interactions take place on a local scale between
small numbers of people, and competition for resources takes place on a
more global scale among large numbers of people.}"
"{We extend research on the consequentiality of stated preference choices
to a threshold provision mechanism for public goods. We develop a simple
theoretical model of option price to analyze how option price varies
with payment and provision uncertainty. We explore whether threshold
provision contributions are similarly influenced by payment and
provision uncertainty using an induced value contribution experiment.
Results suggest that: (1) the probability of payment has a negative
effect on contributions; (2) the probability of provision has a positive
effect on contributions. We offer subjective beliefs regarding payment
and provision as a plausible systematic explanation for hypothetical
bias.}"
"{The cognitive basis of prosocial behavior has received considerable
recent attention. Previous work using economic games has found that in
social dilemmas, intuitive decisions are more prosocial on average. The
Social Heuristics Hypothesis (SHH) explains this result by contending
that strategies which are successful in daily life become automatized as
intuitions. Deliberation then causes participants to adjust to the
self-interested strategy in the specific setting at hand. Here we
provide further evidence for the SHH by confirming several predictions
regarding when and for whom time pressure/delay will and will not alter
contributions in a Public Goods Game (PGG). First, we replicate and
extend previous results showing that (as predicted by the SHH) trust of
daily-life interaction partners and previous experience with economic
games moderate the effect of time pressure/delay in social dilemmas. We
then confirm a novel prediction of the SHH: that deliberation should not
undermine the decision to benefit others when doing so is also
individually payoff-maximizing. Our results lend further support to the
SHH, and shed light on the role that deliberation plays in social
dilemmas.}"
"{Helping is a cornerstone of social organization and commonplace in human
societies. A major challenge for the evolutionary sciences is to explain
how cooperation is maintained in large populations with high levels of
migration, conditions under which cooperators can be exploited by
selfish individuals. Cultural group selection models posit that such
large-scale cooperation evolves via selection acting on populations
among which behavioural variation is maintained by the cultural
transmission of cooperative norms. These models assume that individuals
acquire cooperative strategies via social learning. This assumption
remains empirically untested. Here, I test this by investigating whether
individuals employ conformist or payoff-biased learning in public goods
games conducted in 14 villages of a forager-horticulturist society, the
Pahari Korwa of India. Individuals did not show a clear tendency to
conform or to be payoff-biased and are highly variable in their use of
social learning. This variation is partly explained by both individual
and village characteristics. The tendency to conform decreases and to be
payoff-biased increases as the value of the modal contribution
increases. These findings suggest that the use of social learning in
cooperative dilemmas is contingent on individuals' circumstances and
environments, and question the existence of stably transmitted cultural
norms of cooperation.}"
"{Socially destructive behavior in a public good environment like damaging
public goods is an underexposed phenomenon in economics. In an
experiment we investigate whether such behavior can be influenced by the
very nature of an environment. To that purpose we use a Fragile Public
Good (FPG) game which puts the opportunity for destructive behavior
(taking) on a level playing field with constructive behavior
(contributing). We find substantial evidence of destructive decisions,
sometimes leading to sour relationships characterized by persistent
hurtful behavior. While positive framing induces fewer destructive
decisions, shifting the selfish Nash towards minimal taking doubles its
share to more than 20\%. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{Laws and other formal rules are `obligations backed by incentives'. In
this paper we explore how formal rules affect cooperative behavior. Our
analysis is based on a series of experimental public good games designed
to isolate the impact of exogenously requested minimum contributions
(obligations) from those of the marginal incentives backing them. We
find that obligations have a sizeable effect on cooperative behavior
even in the absence of incentives. When non-binding incentives are
introduced, requested contributions strongly sustain cooperation.
Therefore, in contrast with cases in which incentives crowd-out
cooperative behavior, in our experiments obligations and incentives are
complementary, jointly supporting high levels of contributions.
Moreover, we find that variations in obligations affect behavior even
when incentives are held constant. Finally, we explore the behavioral
channels of the previous results, finding that people's beliefs about
others' contributions and the willingness to cooperate are both called
into play. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}"
"{Background: Allowing players to punish their opponents in Public Goods
Game sustains cooperation within a group and thus brings advantage to
the cooperative individuals. However, the possibility of punishment of
the co-players can result in antisocial punishment, the punishment of
those players who contribute the most in the group. To better understand
why antisocial punishment exists, it must be determined who are the
anti-social punishers and who are their primary targets.
Methods: For resolving these questions we increased the number of
players in a group from usual four to twelve. Each group played six
rounds of the standard Public Goods Game and six rounds of the Public
Goods Game with punishment. Each player in each round received 20 CZK
(\$ 1.25). Players (N=118) were rematched after each round so that they
would not take into consideration opponents' past behavior.
Results: The amount of the punishment received correlated negatively
with the contribution (p= -0.665, p<0.001). However, this correlation
was positive for players in the highest contributors-quartile (p =0.254,
p<0.001). Therefore, the graph of relation between the contribution
given and punishment obtained was U-shaped (R-2=0.678, p<0.001) with the
inflection point near the left boarder of the upper quartile. The
antisocial punishment was present in all groups, and in eight out of ten
groups the Justine Effect (the positive correlation between the
contribution to the public pool and the risk of suffering punishment in
the subpopulation of altruistic players) emerged. In our sample, 22.5\%
subjects, all of them Free riders and low contributors, punished the
altruistic players.
Conclusions: The results of our experimental game-study revealed the
existence of the Justine effect - the positive correlation between the
contribution to the public pool by a subpopulation of the most
altruistic players, and the amount of punishment these players obtained
from free-riders.}"

"Provision of public goods often requires sufficient contributions from group members, and improper contributions are likely to produce feelings of injustice. Building on previous research, I develop a justice theory that explains how framing social comparisons in particular ways will make actors more or less sensitive and reactive to departures from fair contributions. In turn, this is predicted to impact justice-restoring behaviors such as reducing subsequent contributions to a public good, punishing group members, or exiting the group. This integrated theory shows how varying the way key pieces of information are framed affects fairness perceptions and subsequent behaviors in social dilemma settings as well as a broader contribution and/or reward settings. By integrating theories of distributive justice and literature on framing the following dissertation aims to better understand the perceptual, emotional, and behavioral effects of socially constructed frames on behavior public goods dilemma situations. The proposed theory is mathematically formalized and utilized to generate logically connected assumptions and derivations. The key terms, assumptions, and derivations are operationalized through the testable hypotheses aiming to measure variations in justice evaluations and justice restoring behaviors across different theoretical conditions. The hypotheses are tested in a hypothetical vignette and a standard laboratory-based public goods setting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{Within-group communication in competitive coordination games has been
shown to increase competition between groups and lower efficiency. This
study further explores potentially harmful effects of communication, by
addressing the questions of (1) asymmetric communication and (2) the
endogenous emergence of communication. Our theoretical analysis provides
testable hypotheses regarding the effect of communication on competitive
behavior and efficiency. We test these predictions using a laboratory
experiment. The experiment shows that although asymmetric communication
is not as harmful as symmetric communication, it leads to more
aggressive competition and lower efficiency relative to the case when
neither group can communicate. Moreover, groups vote to endogenously
establish communication channels even though they would earn higher
payoffs if jointly they chose to restrict within-group communication.}"
"{We build on the social heuristics hypothesis, the literature on the
glucose model of self-control, and recent challenges on these hypotheses
to investigate whether individuals exhibit a change in degree of trust
and reciprocation after consumption of a meal. We induce short-term
manipulation of hunger followed by the trust game and a decision on
whether to leave personal belongings in an unlocked and unsupervised
room. Our results are inconclusive. While, we report hungry individuals
trusting and reciprocating more than those who have just consumed a meal
in a high trust society, we fail to reject the null with small number of
observations (N = 101) and experimental sessions (N = 8). In addition,
we find no evidence of short-term hunger having an impact on charitable
giving or decisions in public good game.}"
"{Multilingualism is the global norm, but the implications of this for
cooperation and public goods provision have not been studied before. We
test whether the language in which a public goods game is played affects
subjects' contributions amongst a bilingual population in eastern
Uganda, finding that subjects contribute 30\% more on average in the
national language. This treatment effect is solely driven by those most
associated with the local Gisu identity, for whom contributions are
43-74\% higher in the national language. This difference fits with Gisu
culture's high value on self-reliance and low value on reciprocity and
cooperation, due to a violent history of intense competition over land.
Language is thus shown to affect cooperation, but only for individuals
who both have different latent norms and for whom language activates
these norms.

"{In explaining the pressing issue in biology and social sciences how
cooperation emerges in a population of self-interested individuals,
researchers recently pay intensive attentions to the role altruistic
punishment plays. However, as higher-order cooperators, survival of
punishers is puzzling due to their extra cost in regulating norm
violators. Previous works have highlighted the importance of individual
mobility in promoting cooperation. Yet its effect on punishers remains
to be explored. In this work we incorporate this feature into modeling
the behavior of punishers, who are endowed with a choice between leaving
current place or staying and punishing defectors. Results indicate that
optimal mobility level of punishers is closely related to the cost of
punishing. For considerably large cost, there exists medium tendency of
migration which favors the survival of punishers. This holds for both
the direct competition between punishers and defectors and the case
where cooperators are involved, and can also be observed when various
types of punishers with different mobility tendencies fight against
defectors simultaneously. For cheap punishment, mobility does not
provide with punishers more advantage even when they are initially rare.
We hope our work provide more insight into understanding the role
individual mobility plays in promoting public cooperation.}"
"{We analyze how Costa Rican coffee farmer's behavior in an experimental
public good game depends on the institutional structure of the farmers
buying point (cooperative vs. privately owned mills), and on the
background of their game partners (partners selling to the same type of
mill or not). We find that cooperative farmers do not display more
public good orientation than private market farmers when playing with
partners from the same type of mill. However, though farmers selling to
private mills make no difference with respect to the background of
partners, farmers selling to cooperatives significantly decrease
contributions when paired with non-cooperative members. Finally, we
study how self-selection into a mechanism that punishes the lowest
contributors effects contributions both inside the group and with
partners of the opposite background, and we show that it increases
contributions by cooperative farmers interacting with non-cooperative
farmers by more than 100\%.}"
"{While much prosocial behavior has traditionally taken place in
non-market contexts, such as families, clans, and social associations,
it is in increasingly brought into the market context. For example,
companies increasingly promote their products and services by engaging
in charitable giving and policy makers increasingly push for the
implementation of market-driven prosocial initiatives. However, this
trend has occurred without being informed by evidence on how the market
influences individuals' engagement in prosocial behavior. Using a public
goods game that simulates a market and a non-market context, we analyze
prosocial behavior and its psychological underpinnings across these two
contexts. First, we find that prosocial behavior occurs at lower levels
in markets than non-markets. Second, we find that individuals' beliefs
about prosocial norms are more important for prosocial behavior in
markets than non-markets, while the opposite is true for their
autonomous motivation towards prosocial behavior. This suggests that
decision-makers need to adjust the means to foster prosocial behavior,
depending on the institutional context deemed appropriate for specific
prosocial behaviors.}"
"{Understanding how humans sustain cooperation in large, anonymous
societies remains a central question of both theoretical and practical
importance. In the laboratory, experimental behavioural research using
tools like public goods games suggests that cooperation can be sustained
by institutional punishment-analogous to governments, police forces and
other institutions that sanction free-riders on behalf of individuals in
large societies(1-3). In the real world, however, corruption can
undermine the effectiveness of these institutions(4-8). Levels of
corruption correlate with institutional, economic and cultural factors,
but the causal directions of these relationships are difficult to
determine(5,6,8-10). Here, we experimentally model corruption by
introducing the possibility of bribery. We investigate the effect of
structural factors (a leader's punitive power and economic potential),
anti-corruption strategies (transparency and leader investment in the
public good) and cultural background. The results reveal that (1)
corruption possibilities cause a large (25\%) decrease in public good
provisioning, (2) empowering leaders decreases cooperative contributions
(in direct opposition to typical institutional punishment results), (3)
growing up in a more corrupt society predicts more acceptance of bribes
and (4) anti-corruption strategies are effective under some conditions,
but can further decrease public good provisioning when leaders are weak
and the economic potential is poor. These results suggest that a more
nuanced approach to corruption is needed and that proposed panaceas,
such as transparency, may actually be harmful in some contexts.}"
"{Peer influence has a profound impact on decision-making in typically
developing adolescents. In this study, we examined to what extent
adolescent males (age 11-17 years; N = 144) with and without autism
(ASD) were influenced by peer feedback on prosocial behavior, and which
factors were related to individual differences in peer feedback
sensitivity. In a public goods game, participants made decisions about
the allocation of tokens between themselves and their group-in absence
or presence of peer feedback. Adolescents with and without ASD were
sensitive to peer feedback on prosocial behavior. More autism traits and
social interest were associated with less sensitivity to antisocial
feedback, suggesting that peer feedback creates opportunities for social
adjustment in those with and without ASD.}"
"{Using samples of both students and workers in China and comparing
democratic decision making (i.e. being able to choose one's rules) to
non-democratic decision making (i.e. exogenously imposed rule), we show
that Chinese participants cooperate the most in a public goods game
under the stylized authoritarian environment. This finding may be
surprising in light of previous evidence for a ``democracy premium{''}
but is in line with authoritarian norms which are prominent in China. We
further show that there is a systematic association between
participants' values and their relative contribution decisions in
exogenous and endogenous implementation of the rule. Our major finding
is that those subjects that place greater value on accepting authority
are responsible for greater levels of cooperation under top-down
governance. Our findings provide evidence that the effectiveness of a
political institution depends on its congruence with individual values
and societal norms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}"
"{We explore the prospects of cooperation in a threshold public bad game.
The experiment's setup allows us to investigate the issue of effort
coordination between signatories and non-signatories to a climate
agreement under the threat of a catastrophe. Motivated actors may signal
willingness to lead by committing a share of investments to a `clean'
but less remunerative project. The game is parametrized such that the
externality cannot be fully internalized by the coalition, so that some
effort on the part of the second-movers is required if the catastrophic
losses are to be avoided. We manipulate both the relative returns of two
investments and the extent to which the gains from leadership diffuse to
second-movers. We find that the likelihood of reaching a sizeable
coalition of early investors in the clean technology is higher when the
benefits are appropriated by the coalition. Conversely, spillovers can
entice second-movers' adoption.}"

one. We find that an ambiguity-safe strategy is often chosen by

"{This paper examines whether social capital increases individual
contribution in an environmental collective action. Using a laboratory

manner: a trust game to measure level of trust - as a proxy for social
capital - and a public goods game to measure individual contribution to
environmental collective action in the case of waste collection
management. The results show that the level of social capital positively
impacts individual contribution to environmental collective action. This
study also finds that disclosing partial information on a group member's
behaviour in the previous trust game has an impact on people's
willingness to pay for a public good. However, having partial knowledge
as to whether a trustworthy or generous person exists in the group does
not make any difference.}"
"{The article tackles the issues of the effectiveness and rationality of
making choices in the conditions of competition and cooperation. It
confronts the economic theory of rational choice with the empirical
results from an experiment. The aim of the article is to show that
excessive competition and a lack of trust cause limitation of rational
choice in coalitional games.
In the experiment conducted for this study purposes, a public good was
used to construct a situation in which making a huge coalition is the
winning strategy. Despite this fact, the research proves that under
competition supported by uncertainty, which results from the lack of
trust, the decision making entities behave far less rationally than the
game theory would suggest. People competing with each other often take
decisions irrationally.}"
"{In an attempt to solve large-scale environmental problems, government
agencies often resort to formal sanctioning systems: market-based

The purpose of this study was to investigate how the presence of these
formal sanctioning systems impacts informal sanctioning systems for
environmental protection. Study 1 used an experimental game to explore
the influence of market-based and regulatory programs on informal
sanctioning in a laboratory setting. Study 2 was a quasi-experimental
field survey that compared informal sanctioning among Massachusetts
residents living in towns with voluntary, mandatory, and
pay-as-you-throw recycling programs. Results showed that in the presence
of a formal sanctioning system, individuals felt guiltier for not
engaging in the cooperative behavior and expressed more disapproval for
non-cooperators. Combined, these results show that environmental
policies can buttress conservation norms.}"
"{We experimentally investigate whether third-party punishment is more
effective than second-party punishment to increase public goods
contribution. In our experiment, third parties first played the standard
public goods game and then made punishment decisions as independent
bystanders. We find that third parties punished more frequently,
severely and less antisocially, resulting in a higher contribution level
than that driven by second-party punishment. The third party's
exaggerated emotion towards free riders is proposed to explain their
superior punishment effectiveness.}"
"{Punishment of non-cooperators-free riders-can lead to high cooperation
in public goods games (PGG). However, second-order free riders, who do
not pay punishment costs, reduce the effectiveness of punishment. Here
we introduce a ``leader support system,{''} in which one group leader
can freely punish group followers using capital pooled through the
support of group followers. In our experiment, participants engage in
three stages repeatedly: a PGG stage in which followers decide to
cooperate for their group; a support stage in which followers decide
whether to support the leader; and a punishment stage in which the
leader can punish any follower. We compare a support-present condition
with a no-support condition, in which there is an external source for
the leader's punishment. The results show that punishment occurs more
frequently in the support-present condition than the no-support
condition. Within the former, both higher cooperation and higher support
for a leader are achieved under linkage-type leaders-who punish both
non-cooperators and non-supporters. In addition, linkage-type leaders
themselves earn higher profits than other leader types because they
withdraw more support. This means that leaders who effectively punish
followers could increase their own benefits and the second-order free
rider problem would be solved.}"
"{We introduce two novel mechanisms for provision point public goods,
motivated by the design of uniform price auctions: The uniform price
auction mechanism (UPA) collects an endogenously determined uniform
price from everyone offering at least that price, while the uniform
price cap mechanism (UPC) collects the uniform price from everyone
offering at least that price, plus the full offer of everyone offering
less. UPC has the same undominated perfect equilibria as standard
provision point (PPM) and proportional rebate (PR) mechanisms, and UPA a
somewhat broader set. However, our mechanisms' different marginal
penalty structures may facilitate equilibrium selection and lead to
higher contributions and more frequent provision. Through laboratory
experiments, using both homogeneous (symmetric) and heterogeneous
induced values, we show our mechanisms improve upon PR and PPM: UPC
generates higher aggregate contributions than PR and PPM, leading to
higher provision rates than PPM; UPA attracts much higher contributions,
although it provides less frequently. This ranking emerges because high
offers are more common (especially among high value people in the
heterogeneous environment) in the uniform price mechanisms, where higher
offers only increase the payment when needed for provision. (C) 2016

fishermen from the Mexican and Colombian Pacific. The experimental
design aims at studying behavior under uncertainty concerning the

risk-aversion diminishes the level of catches and changes fishing
practices (e.g. adopting marine reserves), provided that fishermen have
ex ante information on possible climatic consequences. Furthermore,
social preferences (e.g. for cooperation and reciprocity) also play an
important role regarding extraction from common-pool resources. Other
factors, such as income, gender and religion are also found to have some
influence. These results have important implications for adaptation

"{We find using laboratory experiments that primes that make religion
salient cause subjects to identify more with their religion and affect
their economic choices. The effect on choices varies by religion. For
example, priming causes Protestants to increase contributions to public
goods, whereas Catholics decrease contributions to public goods, expect
others to contribute less to public goods, and become less risk averse.
A simple model implies that priming effects reveal the sign of the
marginal impact of religious norms on preferences. We find no evidence
of religious priming effects on disutility of work effort, discount
rates, or dictator game generosity.}"
"{Studies have demonstrated that altruistic punishment can motivate
pro-social behavior in settings that require group cooperation. This
paper extends these findings to the voter participation game. Using a
laboratory experiment we find that some subjects are willing to punish
abstainers and that punishment increases participation. However, not all
subjects respond to punishment equally. We find that punishment
increases turnout more among subjects with a egoist social value
orientation (SVO) than among subjects with a pro-social SVO. This
suggests that increased opportunities for altruistic punishment do not
just increase participation, but may also change the composition of the
electorate.}"

"{In low-income countries, grassroots collective action for the management
of a common environmental resource is a well-known substitute for

experimentally what its effect is on social capital. To this purpose we
structure a sandwich' experiment in which participants play a common
pool resource game (CPRG) between two trust games in a Nairobi slum
where social capital is scarce but informal rules regulating the commons
are abundant. Our findings show that the change in trustworthiness
between the two trust game rounds generated by the CPRG experience is
crucially affected by the subjective satisfaction about the CPRG, rather
than by standard objective measures related to CPRG players' behaviour.
These results highlight that subjective satisfaction in a collective
action has relevant predictive power on social capital creation,
providing information which can be crucial to designing successful

results suggest that offering rebates and refunds, and the existence of
seed money may, to some extent, play substitute roles in encouraging
giving behavior. Seed money has a significant positive effect on

"{We explore the idea that prosocial behavior in experimental games is
driven by social norms imported into the laboratory. Under this view,
differences in behavior across subjects is driven by heterogeneity in
sensitivity to social norms. We introduce an incentivized method of
eliciting individual norm-sensitivity, and we show how it relates to
play in public goods, trust, dictator, and ultimatum games. We show how
our observations can be rationalized in a stylized model of
norm-dependent preferences under reasonable assumptions about the nature
of social norms. Then we directly elicit norms in these games to test
the robustness of our interpretation.}"
"{We explore how the introduction of formal insurance affects the
within-village dynamics of social capital in south-western Uganda. As a
proxy for social capital, we use contributions in a public goods game.
Consistent with existing evidence, our data suggest formal insurance
crowds out social capital. However, and surprisingly, overall
contributions to the common pot do not go down because insurance
adopters reduce their contributions. Instead, social capital erodes
because the uninsured, or the local poor, lower their contributions. We
discuss what might explain this finding.}"
"{Prior theory suggests that reputation spreading (e.g., gossip) and
punishment are two key mechanisms to promote cooperation in groups, but
no behavioral research has yet examined their relative effectiveness and
efficiency in promoting and maintaining cooperation. To examine these
issues, we observed participants interacting in a four-round public
goods game (PGG) with or without gossip and punishment options, and a
subsequent two-round trust game (TG). We manipulated gossip as the
option to send notes about other group members to these members' future
partners, and punishment as the option to assign deduction points to
reduce other group members' outcomes with a fee-to-fine ratio of 1:3.
Findings revealed that in the four-round PGG, the option to gossip
increased both cooperation and individual earnings, whereas the option
to punish had no overall effect on cooperation (but a positive effect on
cooperation in the last two rounds of the PGG) and significantly
decreased individual earnings. Importantly, the initial option to gossip
made people more trusting and trustworthy in the subsequent TG when
gossip was no longer possible, compared to the no-gossip condition.
Thus, we provide some initial evidence that gossip may be more effective
and efficient than punishment to promote and maintain cooperation.}"

"{Kin selection theory predicts that costly cooperative behaviors evolve
most readily when directed toward kin. Dispersal plays a controversial
role in the evolution of cooperation: dispersal decreases local
population relatedness and thus opposes the evolution of cooperation,
but limited dispersal increases kin competition and can negate the
benefits of cooperation. Theoretical work has suggested that plasticity
of dispersal, where individuals can adjust their dispersal decisions
according to the social context, might help resolve this paradox and
promote the evolution of cooperation. Here, we experimentally tested the
hypothesis that conditional dispersal decisions are mediated by a
cooperative strategy: we quantified the density-dependent dispersal
decisions and subsequent colonization efficiency from single cells or
groups of cells among six genetic strains of the unicellular Tetrahymena
thermophila that differ in their aggregation level (high, medium, and
low), a behavior associated with cooperation strategy. We found that the
plastic reaction norms of dispersal rate relative to density differed
according to aggregation level: highly aggregative genotypes showed
negative density-dependent dispersal, whereas low-aggregation genotypes
showed maximum dispersal rates at intermediate density, and
medium-aggregation genotypes showed density-independent dispersal with
intermediate dispersal rate. Dispersers from highly aggregative
genotypes had specialized long-distance dispersal phenotypes, contrary
to low-aggregation genotypes; medium-aggregation genotypes showing
intermediate dispersal phenotype. Moreover, highly aggregation genotypes
showed evidence for beneficial kin-cooperation during dispersal. Our
experimental results should help to resolve the evolutionary conflict
between cooperation and dispersal: cooperative individuals are expected
to avoid kin-competition by dispersing long distances, but maintain the
benefits of cooperation by dispersing in small groups.}"
"{This paper investigates the driving forces behind informal sanctions in
cooperation games and the extent to which theories of fairness and
reciprocity capture these forces. We find that cooperators' punishment
is almost exclusively targeted toward the defectors, but the latter also
impose a considerable amount of spiteful punishment on the cooperators.
However, spiteful punishment vanishes if the punishers can no longer
affect the payoff differences between themselves and the punished
individual, whereas the cooperators even increase the resources devoted
to punishment in this case. Our data also discriminate between different
fairness principles. Fairness theories that are based on the assumption
that players compare their own payoff to the group's average or the
group's total payoff cannot explain the fact that cooperators target
their punishment at the defectors. Fairness theories that assume that
players aim to minimize payoff inequalities cannot explain the fact that
cooperators punish defectors even if payoff inequalities cannot be
reduced. Therefore, retaliation, i.e., the desire to harm those who
committed unfair acts, seems to be the most important motive behind
fairness-driven informal sanctions.}"
"This article describes a new approach to debriefing that uses the discussion forum feature of the Moodle open source course management system to debrief a simulation game with undergraduate business students. The simulation game allowed the students to experience the fragility of trust when sharing knowledge in a global virtual project team. I found using the Moodle forum for gathering written feedback on the task to be an improvement over verbal feedback sessions used with previous classes. The Moodle forum provides spontaneous and simultaneous rich feedback from a larger number of students and increases their awareness of the complexity of the task. It became clear to the students that there was no blueprint for success in the game but that participants each had to make sense of the experience in their own way.

"Many groups require cooperation in order to efficiently complete tasks in a manner that benefits all group members. The antecedents of cooperative and competitive behavior have been well studied using a particular class of problems called social dilemmas. Cultural variables, such as collectivism, are often thought to influence cooperative behavior in groups, but experimental evidence has seen mixed results. The current study attempts to add to our understanding of the effects of cultural variables on cooperative and competitive behavior in groups by advancing two major ideas: (1) that the Input-Process-Output (I-P-O) framework can be used as a conceptualization for understanding the impact of cultural variables on potential group outcomes, provided that a distinction is made between potentially meaningful but task-unrelated distal inputs such as collectivism and task-related proximal inputs, and (2) that group process can be indexed using variance components calculated from the Social Relations Model (SRM). Using two social dilemmas as experimental media, participants were placed in groups of four and asked to report what they expected each of their group members to do during the social dilemmas and how much they trusted each of their fellow group members. Results demonstrate that collectivism increases the tendency to expect similar behavior from fellow group members and to trust fellow group members at similar levels when given little diagnostic information. In turn, more competitive behavior is demonstrated in groups that have members who all expect similar behavior from each group member, but show variability regarding what the behavior will be. The study demonstrates (1) a significant relationship between collectivism and expectations of other group members' behavior, (2) expectations will synthesize into meaningful variance components as calculated using SRM, (3) SRM variance components serve as useful indicators of group process and, (4) SRM variance components can be used to predict cooperative and competitive behavior in social dilemma situations. This research demonstrates the value of using SRM variances as indices of process and underscores the theoretical utility of the I-P-O framework as an explanatory tool of group behavior.

"Collective action faces a public goods social dilemma where there exists an inherent tension between individual and collective interests. Considering the economic and social significance of public goods dilemmas, an important research question is why public goods dilemmas often result in collective failure. This dissertation proposes an explanation and solution for this question. By way of explanation, public good dilemmas often result in collective failure because individuals perceive themselves as highly vulnerable to the uncertain behavior of others. The solution to this question is found in taking a real options approach to social dilemmas. The thesis of this dissertation is that, in social dilemmas, real options provide collectives opportunity to achieve small wins and small wins enable collective action by reducing perceived vulnerability. Real options allow individuals in social dilemmas to know they can trust their partners. If there is mutual cooperation when investing in the pilot project, then this mutual cooperation acts as a small win, and this small win increases trust. Increasing trust reduces uncertainty about what others will do, and this decrease in uncertainty minimizes perceived vulnerability. Because of reduced perceptions of vulnerability, individuals are more willing to contribute toward the public good. The effect of the pilot project on trust is moderated by an individual's exposure in the pilot project. When exposure is high, mutual cooperation is less likely, leading to a trust breach and collective-task failure, respectively decreasing a member's trust in the other members' intentions and belief in their ability to mobilize to collective action. When exposure is low, mutual cooperation is most likely; however, without 'enough vulnerability' among parties, high trust and efficacy beliefs are less likely to develop. This dissertation tests these hypotheses using a series of laboratory experiments. These experiments also provide theoretical elaboration on the role of several real option structures and outcome variance. The results show support for the proposed model and also offer theoretical and managerial implications for how real options should (not) be used to foster collective action.

"We examined the influence of Individualism and Collectivism (I–C) on co-operation in workgroups at three levels (societal, organizational, and personal). Data were from 153 American business students representing an individualistic society and 207 Vietnamese counterparts (a collectivistic society). Participants role-played managers for a simulated company with either a collectivistic or individualistic organizational culture in a computerized social-dilemma game. Societal cultures did not moderate the interaction effect between organization-level I–C and person-level Individualism. Those high on individualism pursued their own gains in a dominantly individualistic organizational culture, yet behaving co-operatively in a collectivistic organizational culture. Interestingly, societal cultures moderated the effect of organizational culture on co-operation, such that the positive relationship between organization-level I–C and co-operation was weaker in a collectivistic society (Vietnam) than in an individualistic society (the United States). The results indicate the need for an integrative, cross-level approach to better understand the determinants of co-operation across societies, organizations, and individuals.

"Research has repeatedly shown that people who are habitually sensitive towards unjust victimizations tend to behave uncooperatively and hostile under certain circumstances. But what exactly is the underlying motivation for such uncooperativeness? One explanation is that victim-sensitive individuals behave uncooperatively in order to retribute fateful disadvantages in the past; an alternative explanation is that victim-sensitive individuals behave uncooperatively in order to avoid being exploited in the future. Two experimental studies are presented in which participants were confronted with an unfavorable outcome that was either due to bad luck or to another person’s mean intentions. Findings from both studies suggest that victim-sensitive individuals are specifically sensitive towards mean intentions, but not to fateful disadvantages in general.

"Equality is an important coordination rule in social dilemmas. Studies have shown that a violation of equality elicits strong negative emotions. This research addresses whether these emotional reactions occur when another group member is in need of social support. Results showed that participants reacted less negatively if equality was violated and the other person was in need. Moreover, it was shown that there are individual differences in the extent to which people are influenced by fairness violations in their emotional reactions. In particular, Conscientiousness was important for people's emotional reactions, and people low rather than high in Conscientiousness reacted more negatively. These findings are discussed in light of coordination rules and emotions in social dilemmas and individual differences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"Cooperation in social dilemmas is often challenged by negative noise, or unintended errors, such that the actual behavior is less cooperative than intended—for example, arriving later than intended for a meeting due to an unusual traffic jam. The present research was inspired by the notion that doing a little more for one's interaction partner, which may be movitvated by empathetic feelings, can effectively reduce the detrimental effects of 'negative noise,' or unintended incidents of noncooperation. Consistent with hypotheses, negative noise exhibited detrimental effects on cooperation, but such effects were absent when empathy-motivated cooperation was present. We conclude that empathy has broad benefits for social interaction, in that it can be an effective tool for coping with misinterpreted behaviors, thereby maintaining or enhancing cooperation.

"Among the most researched solutions to social dilemmas is communication. Since the late 1950s, it has been well known that communication enhances cooperation in social dilemmas. This article reports a meta-analysis of this literature (forty-five effect sizes) and finds a large positive effect of communication on cooperation in social dilemmas (d = 1.01). This effect is moderated by the type of communication, with a stronger effect of face-to-face discussion (d = 1.21) compared to written messages (d = 0.46). The communication-cooperation relationship is also stronger in larger, compared to smaller, group social dilemmas. Whether communication occurred before or during iterated dilemmas did not statistically affect the communication-cooperation effect size. Results are discussed according to theory and research on communication in social dilemmas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"In social dilemmas, verbal communication of one's intentions is an important factor in increasing cooperation. In addition to verbal communication of one's intentions, also the communication of emotions of anger and happiness can influence cooperative behavior. In the present paper, we argue that facial expressions of emotion moderate verbal communication in social dilemmas. More specifically, three experiments showed that if the other person displayed happiness he or she was perceived as honest, trustworthy, and reliable, and cooperation was increased when verbal communication was cooperative rather than self-interested. However, if the other person displayed anger, verbal communication did not influence people's decision behavior. Results also showed interactive effects on people's perceptions of trustworthiness, which partially mediated decision behavior. These findings suggest that emotion displays have an important function in organizational settings because they are able to influence social interactions and cooperative behavior.

"Previous research has shown that rewards are effective incentives to encourage cooperation in social dilemmas. What happens to cooperation rates when those rewards are removed, however, has not been investigated. A study was designed to test the hypothesis that offering rewards for cooperation will undermine cooperation below control group levels when those rewards are removed. Messages that promote either the private gain or the public gain to be had from cooperation were also tested, with the former hypothesized to operate similarly to actual rewards. Results indicated that rewards and both message types increased cooperation rates above control levels when present. When the messages and rewards were removed, the reward condition decreased to control levels, while the message conditions remained at the same high level. Potential explanatory mechanisms are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"{We provide experimental evidence on behavior in a public goods game
featuring a so-called point of no return, meaning that if the group's
total contribution falls below this point all payoffs are reduced.
Participants receive either common or private signals about the point of
no return, and experience either high or low reductions in payoffs if
insufficient contributions are made. Our data reveal that, as expected,
contributions are higher if the cost of not reaching the threshold is
high than if it is low. High signal values discourage contributions and
endanger the likelihood of success when signals are common, but not when
signals are private. In addition, successful coordination of
contributions is less frequent in a control treatment featuring a
standard provision point mechanism than in the experimental treatment
where the payoff reduction factor is high, although the theoretical

"{We propose an individual-based model to describe the effects of memory
and learning in the evolution of cooperation in a public goods game
(PGG) in a well-mixed population. Individuals are endowed with a set of
strategies, and in every round of the game they use one strategy out of
this set based on their memory and learning process. The payoff of a
player using a given strategy depends on the public goods enhancement
factor r and the collective action of all players. We investigate the
distribution of used strategies as well as the distribution of
information patterns. The outcome depends on the learning process, which
can be dynamic or static. In the dynamic learning process, the players
can switch their strategies along the whole game, and use the strategy
providing the highest payoff at current time step. In the static
learning process, there is a training period where the players randomly
explore different strategies out of their strategy sets. In the rest of
the game, players only use the strategy providing the highest payoff
during the training period. In the dynamic learning process, we observe
a transition from a non-cooperative regime to a regime where the level
of cooperation reaches about 50\%. As in the standard PGG, in the static
learning process there is a transition from the non-cooperative regime
to a regime where the level of cooperation can be higher than 50\% at r
= N. In both learning processes the transition becomes smoother as the
memory size of individuals increases, which means that the lack of
information is a key ingredient causing the defection. (C) 2015 Elsevier

"{We investigate experimentally whether the endowment of potential
contributors changes outcomes in threshold public-good games. We find
that the variance in contributions is significantly reduced for low and
high levels of endowment in comparison with an intermediate level of
endowment. This difference emerges with experience. Evidence on whether
the level of endowment influences the success rate at providing public
goods is more mixed. We provide, however, a measure of endowment size
that correlates with success rate. Our interpretation suggests that
people find it hardest to coordinate on the provision of threshold
public goods when endowments are of intermediate size. By intermediate
we mean that the endowment is small enough that people need to
contribute relatively a lot to fund the good, but also large enough that
no one person is critical in providing the good.}"
"{Internet is a very attractive technology for the implementation of
experiments, both in order to obtain larger and more diverse samples and
as a field of economic research in its own right. This paper reports on
an experiment performed both online and in the laboratory, designed to
strengthen the internal validity of decisions elicited over the
Internet. We use the same subject pool, the same monetary stakes and the
same decision interface, and control the assignment of subjects between
the Internet and a traditional university laboratory. We apply the
comparison to the elicitation of social preferences in a Public Good
game, a dictator game, an ultimatum bargaining game and a trust game,
coupled with an elicitation of risk aversion. This comparison concludes
in favor of the reliability of behaviors elicited through the Internet.
We moreover find a strong overall parallelism in the preferences
elicited in the two settings. The paper also reports some quantitative
differences in the point estimates, which always go in the direction of
more other-regarding decisions from online subjects. This observation
challenges either the predictions of social distance theory or the
generally assumed increased social distance in internet interactions.}"

cooperatively and more consistently than the undergraduates. Legislators
are also less responsive to treatments that involve social elements but
are more likely to respond to additional information that they receive.
Further, legislators' fixed characteristics explain much of the
variation in how legislators play the game. We discuss the implications
of these findings for understanding how institutions affect the

"{Strong negative reciprocity, that is, sanctions imposed on norm
violators at the punisher's own expense, has powerful
cooperation-enhancing effects in both real-life and experimental game
situations. However, it is plausible that punishment may obtain
alternative roles depending on social context and the personality
characteristics of participants. We examined the occurrence of punishing
behavior among 80 subjects in a strongly competitive Public Goods game
setting. Despite the punishment condition, the amount of the
contributions decreased steadily during the game. The amount of
contributions had no significant effect on received and imposed
punishments. The results indicate that certain social contexts (in this
case, intensive competition) exert modifying effects on the role that
punishment takes on. Subjects punished each other in order to achieve a
higher rank and a financially better outcome. Punishment primarily
functioned as a means of rivalry, instead of as a way of second-order
cooperation, as strong reciprocity suggests. These results indicate the
need for the possible modification of the social conditions of
punishment mechanisms described by the strong reciprocity theory as an
evolutionary explanation of human cooperation.}"
"{Objectives. Empirical work with western populations suggests that aging
is associated with changes in economic decision making, including, for
example, increased prosocial tendencies. We investigated the generality
of age effects in social and nonsocial domains by assessing various
measures of economic decision making in a rural population from Morocco.
Method. We measured age/cohort differences using a number of economic
games (risk game, time preferences game, dictator game, trust game, and
public goods game) in over 700 participants ranging from 17 to 92 years
of age.
Results. The results suggest a negative relation between age and risk
taking and a concave relation between age and contribution to a public
good, but no significant age trends in time preferences, altruism,
trust, or trustworthiness.
Discussion. Our results indicate that the relationship between aging and
decision making is not universal and is shaped by local culture and the
type of task rather than biological factors alone. More research is
needed to understand the unique age trends prevalent in specific
populations and tasks.}"
"{International commitments to reduce emissions must be negotiated between
countries in a manner considered to be fair or equitable. While the
burden-sharing principles commonly advocated in climate negotiations
reflect different views of what constitutes a fair way to distribute the
abatement burden, their use can also be strategically motivated to
legitimise a specific bargaining position. In this context, using a
threshold public good game with a climate change framing, real monetary
incentives and drawing on a sample of individuals from the United
States, the European Union, China, India and South Africa, this
multi-country study examines the degree to which the use of
burden-sharing principles reflects material self-interest. In an initial
treatment, participants, who represent the country of which they are a
national, choose between various burden-sharing principles. In a
subsequent treatment, drawing from Rawls' veil of ignorance,
participants are unaware of which country they represent and are
randomly allocated to a country after making their decision. A
comparison of participants' choices across these two treatments

impossible. We vary the information available and investigate how this
affects the expression of social approval and individual contributions.
The expression of social approval significantly increases contributions.
However, the increase is smaller if additional information is provided,
suggesting that social approval is more effective if subjects receive a
noisy signal about others' contributions. (JEL C72, C91, D71, D83)}"

"{Tasks that engage a theory of mind seem to activate a consistent set of

degree of overlap in brain areas that activated to partner decisions in
the two games, including commonly observed theory of mind areas, as well
as several brain areas that have not been reported previously and may
relate to immersion of participants in real social interactions that
have personally meaningful consequences. Although computer partners

partners, most of these activations were stronger for human partners.

"{Background: When our PC goes on strike again we tend to curse it as if
it were a human being. Why and under which circumstances do we attribute
human-like properties to machines? Although humans increasingly interact
directly with machines it remains unclear whether humans implicitly
attribute intentions to them and, if so, whether such interactions
resemble human-human interactions on a neural level. In social cognitive
neuroscience the ability to attribute intentions and desires to others
is being referred to as having a Theory of Mind (ToM). With the present
study we investigated whether an increase of human-likeness of
interaction partners modulates the participants' ToM associated cortical
activity.
Methodology/Principal Findings: By means of functional magnetic
resonance imaging (subjects n = 20) we investigated cortical activity
modulation during highly interactive human-robot game. Increasing
degrees of human-likeness for the game partner were introduced by means
of a computer partner, a functional robot, an anthropomorphic robot and
a human partner. The classical iterated prisoner's dilemma game was
applied as experimental task which allowed for an implicit detection of
ToM associated cortical activity. During the experiment participants
always played against a random sequence unknowingly to them.
Irrespective of the surmised interaction partners' responses
participants indicated having experienced more fun and competition in
the interaction with increasing human-like features of their partners.
Parametric modulation of the functional imaging data revealed a highly
significant linear increase of cortical activity in the medial frontal
cortex as well as in the right temporo-parietal junction in
correspondence with the increase of human-likeness of the interaction
partner (computer<functional robot<anthropomorphic robot<human).
Conclusions/Significance: Both regions correlating with the degree of
human-likeness, the medial frontal cortex and the right temporo-parietal
junction, have been associated with Theory-of-Mind. The results
demonstrate that the tendency to build a model of another's mind
linearly increases with its perceived human-likeness. Moreover, the
present data provides first evidence of a contribution of higher human
cognitive functions such as ToM in direct interactions with artificial
robots. Our results shed light on the long-lasting psychological and
philosophical debate regarding human-machine interaction and the
question of what makes humans being perceived as human.}"
"{Three studies examined the interrelationship between primed constructs,
situation construal, and person perception. Previous research on priming
and person perception has generally neglected the situational context.
We predicted that when rich situational information is included, primed
constructs can lead to assimilation effects on situation construals,
which can in turn lead to contrast effects in person perceptions. Study
1 demonstrated that when situation information is included in the
experimental context, primes lead to contrast in person perceptions.
Study 2, employing a subliminal methodology, demonstrated that these
effects could not be accounted for via previous explanations of contrast
effects, such as correction-based mechanisms, that require overt
recognition of the priming stimuli by the participants. Study 3
demonstrated that the contrastive effects of the priming stimuli on
person perception obtained in Studies 1 and 2 are in fact due to the
intervening assimilative effects of the priming stimuli on situation
construal-that is, the primed constructs led to contrast effects on
perceptions of the actor via their assimilative effects on perceptions
of the situation in which that actor was embedded. Additionally,
moderator variables demonstrated that this effect is most pronounced
when the target actor's behavior is described as relatively unambiguous

"{Adolescence is a time of increased sensitivity to peer influence, which

which participants made decisions about the allocation of coins between
themselves and the group. Participants received manipulated peer
feedback on a subset of decisions. Results indicate a significant
interaction between feedback condition (prosocial, antisocial, or no

"{Cooperation is essential for the success of societies and there is an
ongoing debate whether individuals have therefore developed a general
spontaneous tendency to cooperate or not. Findings that cooperative
behavior is related to shorter decision times provide support for the
spontaneous cooperation effect, although contrary results have also been
reported. We show that cooperative behavior is better described as
person x situation interaction, in that there is a spontaneous
cooperation effect for prosocial but not for proself persons. In three
studies, one involving population representative samples from the US and
Germany, we found that cooperation in a public good game is dependent on
an interaction between individuals' social value orientation and
decision time. Increasing deliberation about the dilemma situation does
not affect persons that are selfish to begin with, but it is related to
decreasing cooperation for prosocial persons that gain positive utility
from outcomes of others and score high on the related general
personality trait honesty/humility. Our results demonstrate that the
spontaneous cooperation hypothesis has to be qualified in that it is
limited to persons with a specific personality and social values.
Furthermore, they allow reconciling conflicting previous findings by
identifying an important moderator for the effect.}"
"{Understanding the causal impact of beliefs on contributions in Threshold
Public Goods (TPGs) is particularly important since the social optimum
can be supported as a Nash Equilibrium and best-response contributions
are a function of beliefs. Unfortunately, investigations of the impact
of beliefs on behavior are plagued with endogeneity concerns. We create
a set of instruments by cleanly and exogenously manipulating beliefs
without deception. Tests indicate that the instruments are valid and
relevant. Perhaps surprisingly, we fail to find evidence that beliefs
are endogenous in either the one-shot or repeated-decision settings. TPG
allocations are determined by a base contribution and beliefs in a one
shot-setting. In the repeated-decision environment, once we instrument
for first-round allocations, we find that second-round allocations are
driven equally by beliefs and history. Moreover, we find that failing to
instrument prior decisions overstates their importance.}"
"{Many real-world decisions are made by individuals as representatives of
groups. Most research, however, studies either individuals or groups as

difference between a decision made as an individual and as a
representative of a group in the context of a public good game. We
conducted a series of experiments to test this question and to
understand mechanisms contributing to potential differences. We found
that representatives contributed less than individuals when they could
not communicate with their constituency. However, when they could
discuss their strategy before playing, they contributed at least as much
as individual decision-makers. Furthermore, when they could justify
their decision after playing, they contributed even more than individual
decision-makers. We discuss potential reasons for this and directions
for future research.}"

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes
Nature of problem: Predicting the crystal structure of a system from its
stoichiometry alone remains a grand challenge in computational materials
science, chemistry, and physics.
Solution method: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search
techniques that use concepts from biological evolution to search for the
global minimum (or a good approximation for it) in a multidimensional
problem. Applied to a priori crystal structure prediction, EAs search to
find atomic arrangements that correspond to stable (low energy or
enthalpy) regions of the chemical structure's potential energy
landscape. The XTALOPT evolutionary algorithm is available for use and
collaboration under the GNU Public License, which is an open-source
license that is officially recognized by the Open Source Initiative
{[}16]. See the publication on XTALOPT'S original implementation {[}17]
and previous version announcement {[}18] for more information on the
method.
Reasons for new version: Since the release of XTALOPT version r7 in May
2011 various bug-fixes have been made, along with the addition of
several new features:
Added support for the LSF and LoadLeveler queuing systems.
Added support for the SIESTA program package {[}10].
Incorporated the XTALCOMP {[}19] library for duplicate structure removal
(niching).
Added the ``mitosis{''} function, which increases the local order of
structures in the initial generation by replicating a unit cell to
create a supercell for constructing the starting structure.
Customizable polling interval for updating remote queue information.
Automatic removal of remote working files (optional).
Optional removal of unnecessary files for VASP calculations.
Option to rank all current structures and export structures to a new
subdirectory as.cml, CONTCAR, or.got. o New option to replace a failing
structure with a new offspring.
Ability to ``inject{''} (seed) a structure mid-run. o Minimum atomic
separation now specified as a fraction of the sum of atomic radii, with
a hard minimum.
Set a final number of structures to be generated before termination of
the search.
Changing the minimum and maximum cell vectors now directly influences
the minimum and maximum volume for the cell.
Implemented an extension for an automated stochastic docking program
(RANDOMDOCK {[}20]) that supports MOPAC {[}11], ADF {[}12], GAMESS
{[}13] and Gaussian {[}14] as back-end molecular quantum chemistry
engines.
Submission of remote calculations is throttled to ease DRMS load.
More server-friendly method of fetching queue data.
Support for GULP shell/core calculations added.
Fix compilation against Qt 4.6.3 and 4.8.0.
Updated space-group detection library to spglib 1.0.8.
Bundled libssh library removed, now an optional dependency.
Added option to use command-line ssh/scp interfaces when libssh is
unavailable or Kerberos authentication is needed.
Numerous misc bug-fixes.
Summary of revisions: See ``Reasons for new versions{''} above.
Running time: Interactive.

"{Although research on public service motivation (PSM) is vast, there is
little evidence regarding the effects of PSM on observable behavior.
This article contributes to the understanding of the behavioral
implications of PSM by investigating whether PSM is associated with
prosocial behavior. Moreover, it addresses whether and how the behavior
of other group members influences this relationship. The article uses
the experimental setting of the public goods game, run with a sample of
263 students, in combination with survey-based PSM measures. A positive
link is found between PSM and prosocial behavior. This relationship is
moderated by the behavior of other group members: high-PSM people act
even more prosocially when the other members of the group show prosocial
behavior as well, but they do not do so if the behavior of other group
members is not prosocial.}"
"{This study proposes the use of an experimental analogue of natural
resource exploitation to evaluate the effects of the real-time
displaying of the amount of available resources and the provision of
written feedback messages on the resource extraction behavior of
participants sharing a common-pool whereby participants are physically
and verbally isolated from each other. The experiment involved the
application of a three-member common-pool resources (CPR) game. The
members of the groups sharing the CPR were changed periodically and were
allowed to talk briefly to each other so that an experienced participant
could give instructions to a newcomer. In this way, it was also possible
to evaluate how the accuracy of instructions regarding resource
preservation and sustainability affects group member resource extraction
patterns and CPR maintenance in the long run. Twenty-two college
students took part and were distributed into three groups: Control,
Display, and Feedback. The amount of resources extracted individually
and by the groups in every round of the game was analyzed, as were the
verbal responses of the experienced participants when giving
instructions to newcomers. Results showed that the manipulated variables
were effective for the short-term decrease in the amount of resources
extracted by the members of the Display and Feedback groups. The
accuracy of the instructions was also important for the sustained
maintenance of the pattern of consumption established by the manipulated
variables, leading to the recovery and the preservation of the resources
in a greater number of the game's rounds.}"
"{There is active debate on gender issues in natural resource management.
For example, it is proposed that women are more cooperative than men
when dealing with natural resources decisions; however, few scientific
studies have directly addressed this hypothesis. We provide evidence for
a greater cooperative attitude in women compared to men in both college
students and coastal fishing communities of Baja California, Mexico, by
means of game theory experiments. In both laboratory and field
experiments, women changed their behaviour towards lower extraction
compared to men, when regulations, sanctions or social scolding were
introduced in the games. These results suggest that raising the role of
women in decision-making, along with an adequate institutional
framework, may lead to a more sustainable use of natural resources.}"
"{The importance of the central bank and the government conducting their
policies has increased recently, with more attention being given to the
effectiveness of policy mix. The non-cooperative models of the monetary
and fiscal game are frequently employed to study interactions between
both authorities. The models assume that the authorities take into
account each other?s choices when making decisions. It is also important
to remember when seeking equilibrium in the non-cooperative models that
in the Nash Equilibrium (which is sought in this study) the parties try
to come up with the best response to the opponent?s decision. The aim of
the paper is to present the Nash Equilibrium in a non-cooperative game
between the government and the central bank using a non-cooperative
model of a fiscal-monetary game (a policy-mix MODEL). This study
demonstrates that in the Nash Equilibrium in the model, the budget
deficit and interest rate of an EU member state depend on the exogenous
data (external to the model), such as inflation target, base inflation
and the Maastricht deficit limit. This study is enhanced by an analysis
of the government and central bank?s sensitivity to the deep parameters
of economic variables.}"
"{This paper introduces a new notion of a ``procedural{''} value for
cooperative TU games. A procedural value is determined by an underlying
procedure of sharing marginal contributions to coalitions formed by
players joining in random order. We consider procedures under which
players can only share their marginal contributions with their
predecessors in the ordering, and study the set of all resulting values.
The most prominent procedural value is, of course, the Shapley value
obtaining under the simplest procedure of every player just retaining
his entire marginal contribution. But different sharing rules lead to
other interesting values, including the ``egalitarian solution{''} and
the Nowak and Radzik ``solidarity value{''}. All procedural values are
efficient, symmetric and linear. Moreover, it is shown that these
properties together with two very natural monotonicity postulates
characterize the class of procedural values. Some possible modifications
and generalizations are also discussed. In particular, it is shown that
dropping one of monotonicity axioms is equivalent to allowing for
sharing marginal contributions with both predecessors and successors in
the ordering.}"
"Explored attributions made by 48 male Chinese undergraduates for their outcome in a competitive matrix game under either public or anonymous conditions of responding. It was hypothesized that the conditions of responding would affect the size of the self-serving bias in at least some of the performance determinants. Ss played in competitive matrix games, the outcomes of which were manipulated so that half of the Ss won and the other half lost. Each S was then asked to report, either to the experimenter or anonymously, the role of his own ability, effort, the task difficulty, and luck in determining his own outcome. Under both conditions of responding, a self-serving bias was found for the Ss' attributions of ability and effort. For attributions to luck, however, conditions of responding interacted with competition outcome so that the egocentric bias was found under anonymous conditions and a self-effacing bias under public conditions.

"Examined role-strain and role-accumulation explanations regarding tension and satisfaction in task-oriented discussions by groups made up of both sexes. Although gender had no effect on competitive behavior in matrix games or on tension and satisfaction in small groups discussing these games, masculine, feminine, and androgynous sex-roles as indexed by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory significantly influenced these behaviors and attitudes. With the exception of tension releases, which are conceptually somewhat ambiguous, androgynous Ss were lowest in tension and highest in satisfaction. A follow-up experiment using all female Ss reproduced these results and also showed that masculine females were high in tension and dissatisfaction. It is suggested that the advantages of role-accumulation experienced by androgynous Ss may result because the roles are internalized, and therefore, may be transferred easily from 1 situation to another.

"Hypothesized that the need to believe in a just world influences the subjective probabilities that a person assigns to various outcomes. That is, moral actions will be thought likely to receive rewards, and immoral actions will be thought likely to be punished. This was tested with data from the University of Michigan Survey Center's national election studies (1964, 1968, and 1970), and with an experiment conducted with 80 male undergraduates. The survey data showed that respondents who saw civil rights tactics as violent (immoral) saw them as self-defeating, while those who saw them as peaceful (moral) saw them as useful. In the experiment, Ss were exposed to 1 of 2 2-person matrix games and were asked to specify the economically optimal strategy. The 2 games had the same strategic structure but different equitable choices. In one set of conditions Ss thought both players were people (hence equity should be regarded as morally required), while in the other set, Ss thought one player was a computer (here equity should be morally irrelevant). Results show that as predicted, (a) in the person conditions, the equitable strategy was regarded as more economically rational; (b) in the computer conditions, equity had no influence on the Ss' assessment of the economically rational strategy.

"Constructed 6 normative models of need for coalition among players in the symmetric 3-person non-zero-sum games of the 2 × 2 × 2 type. The processes of response selection based on all possible needs systems that are combinations of 3 needs were simulated by a computer for the 13 martyr games. Results of the simulation are as follows: (a) It is possible to realize the mutual prosperity cell as the terminal state by needs systems consisting of only joint gains needs among 2 players, even for the Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) game situation. (b) It is suggested that the PD in 3-person games should be divided into weak and strong types depending on the logical structure of the matrix.

"Employed a matrix game format in a 2-by-2 design to study the effects of within-group cooperation and competition under conditions of success and failure on Ss' subsequent treatment of own group and outgroup persons. 62 male undergraduates in 2-person groups either succeeded or failed at a cooperative or competitive game and then awarded points (worth money) to themselves, their partner, and 2 other people. A review of the literature suggested that ingroup–outgroup bias would be greater after successful competition than after unsuccessful competition. Results support this hypothesis. It was also found that Ss in the Cooperation–Failure condition displayed greater ingroup–outgroup bias than Ss in the Cooperation–Success condition. A qualification of the previous research supporting a positive relationship between group cohesiveness and ingroup–outgroup bias is suggested on the basis of the results.
