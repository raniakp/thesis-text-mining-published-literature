Studies 3 to 5 measured early childhood environments (i.e., childhood harshness and unpredictability), manipulated resource scarcity using previously validated methods, and then measured cooperation. Across our studies, we also examined four hypothesized psychological mechanisms that could explain the relation between life history strategy and cooperation: temporal discounting, concern for reputation, social value orientation, and trust in others. Overall, we found no support for the hypothesis that life history strategy predicts cooperation or that early childhood environments interact with current resource scarcity to predict cooperation. Thus, our initial findings imply that life history theory may not account for individual variation in cooperation with unknown others.

They estimated how likely it was that the other player was going to cooperate (expectation of cooperation) before they made their cooperation/defection decision on each game. Supporting the Goal/Expectation Hypothesis, we replicated the effect that expectation of cooperation enhanced cooperation. We also found that risk-seeking individuals cooperated more in more risky games whereas risk-averse individuals cooperated more in less risky games. More importantly, we found that game riskiness moderated the effect of expectation of cooperation on cooperation.

We design a public goods game experiment in which actors elect leaders to make decisions on their behalf in the contribution to public goods. In particular, we compare the leadership elected from direct and indirect election systems. In direct election, a leader is elected directly by majority-votes from a group, whereas in indirect election the group is divided into smaller subgroups and a leader is elected from the elected subgroup leaders. We run a simulation model to show that direct election would choose a more cooperative leader than indirect election when voters’ preferences of leadership are not homogenous. A laboratory experiment with human subjects further indicates that people hold stronger preferences for cooperators as leaders in direct election than in indirect election, suggesting that the voting scheme has an effect not only on the processing of actors’ preferences, but also on the shaping of their preferences of leadership in the public goods dilemma.

Across 29 participants, cooperation was lowest when interacting with a predominantly defecting partner and highest when interacting with a predominantly cooperating partner. Greater depression severity was related to steadier and continued cooperation over trials with the cooperating partner, seeming to reflect a prosocial response tendency when interacting with this partner. With the unbiased partner, depression severity was associated with a more volatile response pattern in reaction to cooperation and defection by this partner. Severity of depression did not influence cooperation with a defecting partner or expectations about partner cooperation reported before the task began. Taken together, these data appear to show that in predominately positive interactions, as in the cooperating partner condition, depression is associated with less volatile, more consistent cooperation. When such clear feedback is absent, as in the unbiased partner condition, depression is associated with more volatile behavior. Nonetheless, participants were generally able to adapt their behavior accordingly in this dynamic interpersonal decision making context.

Participants played four rounds of the game with partners who either cooperated or cheated. In a control condition, the partners’ faces were shown, but no interaction took place. The partners’ behaviors were consistent in the first three rounds of the game, but in the last round some of the partners unexpectedly changed strategies. In the first round of the game, the feedback about a partner's decision elicited a feedback P300, which was more pronounced for cooperation and cheating in comparison to the control condition, but did not vary as a function of feedback valence. In the last round, both the feedback negativity and the feedback P300 were sensitive to expectancy violations. There was no consistent evidence for a negativity bias, that is, enhanced allocation of attention to feedback about another person's cheating in comparison to feedback about another person's cooperation. Instead, participants focused on both positive and negative information, and flexibly adjusted their processing biases to the diagnosticity of the information. This conclusion was corroborated by the ERP correlates of memory retrieval. Successful retrieval of a partner's reputation was associated with an anterior positivity between 400 and 600 ms after face onset. This anterior positivity was more pronounced for both cooperator and cheater faces in comparison to control faces. The results suggest that it is not the negativity of social information, but rather its motivational and behavioral relevance that determines its processing.

Evidence is mixed about what the precise impact of these characteristics is, as the subjects of study are generally randomly paired, generating a heterogeneous mix of the two characteristics. In this study we ex-ante create four different groups of subjects by factoring their higher or lower than the median scores in both altruism and reasoning ability. Then we use these groups in order to analyze the joint effect of the two characteristics on the individual choice of cooperating and on successful paired cooperation. Subjects belonging to each group play first 10 one-shot prisoner’s dilemma (PD) games with ten random partners and then three consecutive 10-round repeated PD games with three random partners. In all games, we elicit players’ beliefs regarding cooperation using an incentive compatible method. Individuals with high altruism are more optimistic about the cooperative behavior of the other player in the one-shot game. They also show higher individual cooperation and paired cooperation rates in the first repetitions of this game. Contrary to the one-shot PD games where high reasoning ability reduces the probability of playing cooperatively, the sign of the relationship is inverted in the first repeated PD game, showing that high reasoning ability individuals better adjust their behavior to the characteristics of the game they are playing. In this sense, the joint effect of reasoning ability and altruism is not linear, with reasoning ability counteracting the cooperative effect of altruism in the one-shot game and reinforcing it in the first repeated game. However, experience playing the repeated PD games takes over the two individual characteristics in explaining individual and paired cooperation. Thus, in a (PD) setting, altruism and reasoning ability significantly affect behavior in single encounters, while in repeated interactions individual and paired cooperation reach similarly high levels independently of these individual characteristics.

The effects of power and resource asymmetry on cooperation,,"cooperation, power, Cooperation, Prisoners Dilemma Game, Interpersonal Control",,,"Stivers, Adam W.","People frequently have interactions where they are interdependent, but differ in the extent to which they have power and resources. Two forms of power are the control one has over the outcomes of others (responsibility) and the extent to which one's outcomes are controlled by others (dependence). With regard to resources, individuals may have more or less resources than others. Prior research on power shows that social dilemmas with higher dependence and higher responsibility illicit more cooperation, but does not show whether dependence or responsibility is the cause of the cooperation. In the first study, participants chose between cooperative and non-cooperative options in a series of Prisoner's Dilemma games (PDG) that varied in dependence and responsibility. It was found that more participants were cooperative in games that had a greater amount of dependence and slightly fewer participants cooperated in games that had a greater amount of responsibility. In Study 2, the games used also varied the amount of resources the participant had relative to the other decision maker. It was found that participants cooperated at the highest rate when they had a resource advantage, less when they had equal resources, and least when they had a resource disadvantage. In both studies the effects of dependence and resources were moderated by Social Value Orientation (SVO): the effects were strongest for people with a joint gain maximizing orientation (Js), weaker for those with an own gain maximizing orientation (Os), and non-significant for people with a relative gain maximizing orientation (Rs).

One answer comes from the tendency of individuals to internalize typically successful behaviors as norms. Different institutional structures can cause different behavioral norms to be internalized. These norms are then carried over into atypical situations beyond the reach of the institution. Here, we experimentally demonstrate such spillovers. First, we immerse subjects in environments that do or do not support cooperation using repeated prisoner’s dilemmas. Afterwards, we measure their intrinsic prosociality in one-shot games. Subjects from environments that support cooperation are more prosocial, more likely to punish selfishness, and more trusting in general. Furthermore, these effects are most pronounced among subjects who use heuristics, suggesting that intuitive processes play a key role in the spillovers we observe. Our findings help to explain variation in one-shot anonymous cooperation, linking this intrinsically motivated prosociality to the externally imposed institutional rules experienced in other settings.

We investigated the relationship between rule preferences and cooperative preferences (conditional reciprocal preference) and tried to explain the adjustments people made when making repeated contributions of public goods (conditional cooperation behavior) from a rule preference perspective. The results show that: (1) Heterogeneous rule-inequality-aversion preferences are found in lab; (2) The stronger the rule-inequality-aversion preference is, the higher the probability is for the individual to become a conditional cooperator in public goods experiment; (3) Individuals who have stronger rule-inequality-aversion are more sensitive to the contributions that are deviated from the norm.

These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants’ cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner’s nationality.

Moreover, we find CBDT provides a better fit to the dynamics of cooperation than does the existing Probit model, which is the first time such a result has been found. We also find that humans aspire to a payoff above the mutual defection outcome but below the mutual cooperation outcome, which suggests they hope, but are not confident, that cooperation can be achieved. Finally, our best-fitting parameters suggest that circumstances with more details are easier to recall. We make a prediction for future experiments: if the repeated PD were run for more periods, then we would be begin to see an increase in cooperation, most dramatically in the second treatment, where history is observed but identities are not.

Twenty-five female participants were scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner’s dilemma games in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of their choices.

At the neural level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation.

One aspect of social decision-making that is of particular importance is cooperative behavior, and identifying means of maintaining and promoting cooperation in the provision of public goods is of vital interest to society. Here, we manipulated social comparison by grading performance rankings on a reaction time task, and then measured cooperative decisions via a modified Public Goods Game (PGG). Findings revealed that individuals ranked highest tended to be more cooperative as compared to those who placed in the bottom rank. Interestingly, this effect was regardless of whether the comparison group members were the subsequent players in the PGG or not, and this effect was stronger in those with higher social orientation. In summary, the present research shows how different social comparison processes (assessed via social rankings) can operate in our daily interaction with others, demonstrating an important effect on cooperative behavior.

Several mechanisms have been demonstrated to promote group cooperation in linear voluntary contribution experiments—such as communication, costly punishment, and centralized bonuses and fines. However, lab experiments have largely neglected a central obstacle to efficient public good provision: Individuals typically have different, private demands for consumption, hindering the ability of either a central authority or the group members themselves to calculate and enforce the optimal behavior. I adapt the standard public goods game to incorporate heterogeneous incentives and provide an assessment of each mechanism in this richer environment. I find that baseline cooperation is similar to that in the standard linear game. Sanctions are weak and generally ineffective. Communication, however, does promote cooperation, especially when subjects are given the opportunity to reveal their demand or demand is observable. Finally, a centralized fine/bonus scheme is most effective at increasing contributions, but low demanders must pay a fine in equilibrium.

Following this line of thought, we systematically tested human subjects for spillover effects from simple coordination tasks (2 × 2 stag hunt [SH] games) to problems of cooperation (2 × 2 prisoner’s dilemma [PD] games) in a laboratory experiment with rigorous controls to rule out subject confusion or habituation. Supporting the hypothesis that decision mechanisms for cooperation problems are linked with decision mechanisms for coordination, our main finding is that cooperation levels in PD games embedded in a sequence of SH games were significantly increased compared to a baseline sequence consisting only of PDs when subjects played in fixed pairs. No such effects could be found when players were randomly rematched each round. Additional findings include that this spillover effect cannot prevent a decay of cooperation over time, that there is no indication of a reversed effect (i.e., no signs of negative spillovers from failed cooperation to miscoordination), and that subjects’ self-reported preferences in SH games are prosocial.

Participants interacted with trustworthy-looking and untrustworthy-looking partners in a sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma Game. Facial trustworthiness was manipulated to stimulate expectations about the future behavior of the partners which were either violated or confirmed by the partners’ cheating or cooperation during the game. In a source memory test, participants were required to recognize the partners and to classify them as cheaters or cooperators. A multinomial model was used to disentangle item memory, source memory and guessing processes. We found an expectancy-congruent bias toward guessing that trustworthy-looking partners were more likely to be associated with cooperation than untrustworthy-looking partners. Source memory was enhanced for cheating that violated the participants’ positive expectations about trustworthy-looking partners. We were interested in whether or not this expectancy-violation effect—that helps to revise unjustified expectations about trustworthy-looking partners—depends on cognitive load induced via a secondary continuous reaction time task. Although this secondary task interfered with working memory processes in a validation study, both the expectancy-congruent guessing bias as well as the expectancy-violation effect were obtained with and without cognitive load. These findings support the hypothesis that the expectancy-violation effect is due to a simple mechanism that does not rely on demanding elaborative processes. We conclude that most cognitive mechanisms underlying social cooperation presumably operate automatically so that they remain unaffected by cognitive load.

In this article, we conduct experiments to investigate how punishment affects cooperation in stochastic social dilemmas where each person can decide whether to cooperate, when the outcomes of alternative strategies are specified probabilistically. Two types of punishment mechanisms are studied: (1) an unrestricted punishment mechanism—both persons can punish—and (2) a restricted punishment mechanism—only cooperators can punish noncooperators. We compare behavior in a two-person deterministic prisoner’s dilemma game (DPD) with a two-person stochastic prisoner’s dilemma (SPD). In all treatments, participants are given information on the other person’s actions. We find that in both games, the restricted punishment mechanism promotes more cooperative behavior than unrestricted punishment. However, the difference in the degree of effectiveness between the two mechanisms is smaller in the SPD game than in the DPD game because noncooperative behavior is less likely to be punished when there is outcome uncertainty. Our findings provide useful information for designing efficient incentive mechanisms to induce cooperation in a stochastic social dilemma environment.

Team competition contains both competitive elements of game play and cooperative behaviors among teammates. Of interest is the effect of playing in varying degrees of team competition (high vs. low social disidentification with the outgroup) and pure competition on feelings of aggression and cooperative behaviors. A between-subjects experiment (N = 70) was conducted to examine the relationship among low disidentification, high disidentification, and pure competition for state hostility, affiliation, and cooperative behaviors. It was predicted that those in the low disidentification conditions would experience significantly lower hostility, but greater affiliation both for ingroup and outgroup members. Compared to pure competition and high disidentification, low disidentification resulted in significantly greater feelings of aggression.

Results: Whether the condition was accumulative or competitive did not significantly predict cooperation. In the final round of each contest however, cooperation was significantly reduced. Sportspersonship predicted a significant amount of cooperation percentage, while final round cooperation was predicted by emotional intelligence. Conclusions: Cooperation is in part determined by individual levels of sportspersonship in all conditions except when actions are free of future consequence.

In men, OT attenuated the fMRI response to unreciprocated cooperation (CD), a negative social interaction, within the amygdala and anterior insula. This effect was specific to interactions with human partners. In contrast, among women, OT unexpectedly attenuated the amygdala and anterior insula response to unreciprocated cooperation from computer but not human partners. Among women, AVP did not significantly modulate the response to unreciprocated cooperation in either the amygdala or the anterior insula. However, among men, AVP attenuated the BOLD response to CD outcomes with human partners across a relatively large cluster including the amygdala and the anterior insula, which was contrary to expectations. Our results suggest that OT may decrease the stress of negative social interactions among men, whereas these effects were not found in women interacting with human partners. These findings support continued investigation into the possible efficacy of OT as a treatment for anxiety disorders.

Here we replicate earlier work showing that such in-group bounded cooperation is conditioned by oxytocin and extend it by showing that oxytocin-motivated in-group cooperation is intuitive rather than deliberated. Healthy males (N =65) and females (N =129) self-administered intranasal placebo or 24IU oxytocin in a double-blind placebo-controlled between-subjects design, were assigned to a three-person in-group (that faced a 3-person out-group), and given an endowment from which they could contribute to a within-group pool (benefitting the in-group), and/or to a between-group pool (benefitting the in-group and punishing the out-group). Prior to decision-making, participants performed a Stroop Interference task that was either cognitively taxing, or not. Cognitively taxed individuals kept less to themselves and contributed more to the within-group pool. Furthermore, participants receiving placebo contributed more to the within-group pool when they were cognitively taxed rather than not; those receiving oxytocin contributed to the within-group pool regardless of cognitive taxation. Neither taxation nor treatment influenced contributions to the between-group pool, and no significant sex differences were observed. It follows that in intergroup settings (i) oxytocin increases in-group bounded cooperation, (ii) oxytocin neither reduces nor increases out-group directed spite, and (iii) oxytocin-induced in-group cooperation is independent of cognitive taxation and, therefore, likely to be intuitive rather than consciously deliberated.

Whether group selection actually did play an important role in the evolution of human cooperation, however, is much debated. Recent experiments have shown that intergroup competitions do increase human cooperation, which has been taken as evidence for group selection as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Here we challenge this standard interpretation. Competitions change the payoff structure by creating a threshold effect whereby the group that contributes more earns an additional prize, which creates some incentive for individuals to cooperate. We present four studies that disentangle competition and thresholds, and strongly suggest that it is thresholds—rather than competitions per se—that increase cooperation. Thus, prior intergroup competition experiments provide no evidence of a unique or special role for intergroup competition in promoting human cooperation, and shed no light on whether group selection shaped human evolution.

They then apply a lay theory dictating that anger decreases cooperation and react accordingly by lowering their own level of cooperation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors report four experiments involving different samples, manipulations, payment schemes and interfaces. The methodological approach was to capitalize on the positives of experimental research (e.g. establishing causality) while also trying to conceptually replicate the findings in different settings. Findings: The authors found evidence for a lay theory (i.e. expectation) that anger decreases cooperation, but that actual cooperation was lowest when angry individuals were paired with other angry individuals, supporting the hypotheses. Research limitations/implications: Anger can spill over from unrelated contexts to affect cooperation, and incidental anger by itself is not enough to decrease cooperation. However, the findings are limited to anger and cannot necessarily be used to understand the effects of other emotions. Practical implications: Before entering into a context that requires cooperation, such as a negotiation, be wary of the emotional state of both yourself and of your partner. This paper suggests that only if both parties are angry, then the likelihood of cooperation is low. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, they are the first researchers to address the question of how incidental anger affects single-round cooperation. By going back to the basics, the authors believe that the findings fill a gap in existing research and offer a building block for future research on anger and cooperation.

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 media conditions (violent book, violent video game, nonviolent video game, and violent TV show) and measured on prosocial behavior before any media exposure and assessed on cooperative behavior after media exposure. Novice and regular gamers did not differ on prosocial behavior before gaming. After media exposure, a self-constructed version of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game was used to measure cooperation. Further analyses were then conducted to measure differences between conditions on cooperative behavior. It was found that regular and multiplayer gamers were not significantly higher or lower on measures of cooperative behavior compared to novices or solitary gamers. Although nonsignificant, effect sizes were consistent with past research which suggests heightened cooperation in regular gamers. Media type exposure did not have a significant effect on cooperative behavior. Findings suggest that cooperative behavior is not less prominent in regular or multiplayer gamers than novices or solitary gamers. These results indicate that, contrary to the predictions one may make from the GAM model of violent gaming (Anderson & Bushman, 2001), violent media exposure does not appear to produce reductions in prosocial or cooperative behavior.

Participants played the game either in face-to-face or face-blocked conditions. The face-to-face interaction led players to cooperate more often, providing behavioral evidence for the use of these nonverbal cues in their social decision-making. In addition, the EEG hyperscanning identified temporal dynamics and inter-brain synchronization across the cortex, providing evidence for involvement of these regions in the processing of face-to-face cues to read each other's intent to cooperate. Most notably, the power of the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz) in the right temporoparietal region immediately after seeing a round outcome significantly differed between face-to-face and face-blocked conditions and predicted whether an individual would adopt a ‘cooperation’ or ‘defection’ strategy. Moreover, inter-brain synchronies within this time and frequency range reflected the use of these strategies. This study provides evidence for how the cortex uses nonverbal social cues to determine other's intentions, and highlights the significance of power in the alpha band and inter-brain phase synchronizations in high-level socio-cognitive processing.

Two of these methods involve a fixed number of repetitions with payoff discounting, followed by random termination [proposed by Sabater-Grande and Georgantzis (J Econ Behav Organ 48:37–50, 2002)] or followed by a coordination game [proposed in (Andersson and Wengström in J Econ Behav Organ 81:207–219, 2012; Cooper and Kuhn in Am Econ J Microecon 6:247–278, 2014a)].

We find that behavior is consistent with the presence of dynamic incentives only with methods using random termination, with the standard method generating the highest level of cooperation. Subject behavior in the other two methods display two features: a higher level of stability in cooperation rates and less dependence on past experience.

However, almost all subjects disclose their identities and successfully achieve cooperation if a cost is charged for the act of hiding.

An individual's estimate of the impact of their contribution on the likelihood of public good production is known as their efficacy. The classic efficacy—cooperation hypothesis holds that individuals will be more likely to contribute if they estimate their contributions to be more necessary. Based on a game theoretical analysis of the SPG game, we contribute to the literature by identifying two distinct components of efficacy, viz. material efficacy and contextual efficacy. The former is based on objective characteristics of group members (such as resources, power, or skill) and the latter on beliefs about the material efficacy of other group members and expectations concerning their behavior. We present evidence from three experimental studies, showing how information on the distribution of material efficacy in the group can break the monotone material efficacy—cooperation relation.

Although such conflicts lie at the heart of various challenging social interactions, we know little about how cooperation in these situations develops. To extend work on social dilemmas to child and adolescent samples, we developed an age-appropriate computer task (the Pizzagame) with the structural features of a public goods game (PGG). We administered the Pizzagame to a sample of 191 children 9 to 16 years of age. Subjects were led to believe they were playing the game over the Internet with three sets of two same-aged, same-sex co-players. In fact, the co-players were computer-generated and programmed to expose children to three consecutive conditions: (1) a cooperative strategy, (2) a selfish strategy, and (3) divergent cooperative–selfish strategies. Supporting the validity of the Pizzagame, our results revealed that children and adolescents displayed conditional cooperation, such that their contributions rose with the increasing cooperativeness of their co-players. Age and gender did not influence children and adolescents’ cooperative behavior within each condition. However, older children adapted their behavior more flexibly between conditions to parallel the strategies of their co-players. These results support the utility of the Pizzagame as a feasible, reliable, and valid instrument for assessing and quantifying child and adolescent cooperative behavior. Moreover, these findings extend previous work showing that age influences cooperative behavior in the PGG.

As in previous research, inequality is operationalized by assigning the role of a ‘strong player’ to one group member, who can punish others at a reduced cost compared to other players. Instability is operationalized by the fact that the role assignment can change across rounds and is contingent on behavior in previous rounds. Three experiments show that under unequal, unstable (punishment‐) power, individuals behave more competitively and engage in a race for power resulting in detrimental effects for the group. Specifically, we find that (i) unstable power goes along with a disproportionate use of punishment; (ii) not inequality by itself but rather the combination of instability and inequality causes this effect; and (iii) this excessive use of punishment is found not only when the role of the strong player is assigned to individuals who previously behaved rather selfishly but also when prosocial behavior leads to the top, speaking for a generalizability of our findings.

In many public goods (PG) games or n-person PD experiments, however, reciprocal strategies are not successful at engendering cooperation. In the present paper, we attribute this difficulty to a coordination problem against free riding among reciprocators: Because it is difficult for the reciprocators to coordinate their behaviors against free riders, this may lead to inequality among players, which will demotivate them from cooperating in future rounds.We propose a new mechanism, institutionalized reciprocity (IR), which refers to embedding the reciprocal strategy as an institution (i.e., institutionalizing the reciprocal strategy). We experimentally demonstrate that IR can prevent groups of reciprocators from falling into coordination failure and achieve high cooperation in PG games. In conclusion, we argue that a natural extension of the present study will be to investigate the possibility of IR to serve as a collective punishment system.

These results question the effectiveness of punishment at promoting cooperation, especially when retaliation is possible. It has been suggested that these findings may stem from the unrealistic assumption that all players are equal in terms of power. However, a previous empirical study which incorporated power asymmetries into an iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game failed to show that power asymmetries stabilize cooperation when punishment is possible. Instead, players cooperated in response to their partner cooperating, and punishment did not yield any additional increase in tendency to cooperate. Nevertheless, this previous study only allowed an all-or-nothing–rather than a variable–cooperation investment. It is possible that power asymmetries increase the effectiveness of punishment from strong players only when players are able to vary their investment in cooperation. We tested this hypothesis using a modified IPD game which allowed players to vary their investment in cooperation in response to being punished. As in the previous study, punishment from strong players did not increase cooperation under any circumstances. Thus, in two-player games with symmetric strategy sets, punishment does not appear to increase cooperation.

The results show that cooperation was higher when people could leave bad partners versus when they could not. When they could not switch partners, people preferred to actively punish defectors rather than withdraw. When they could switch, punishment and switching were equally preferred. Contrary to our predictions, punishment was higher when switching was possible, possibly because cooperators could then desert the defector they had just punished.

This article presents data from an alternative controlled, but context-rich setting—a public goods game in an online browser game—with around 18,000 players from five countries over a period of ten months without observer effects. This article focuses on the robustness of previous findings about cooperative strategies and whether different types of cooperative behavior extend beyond the laboratory setting. Thus, the data presented provides external validity to existing laboratory experiments. The results suggest some important qualifications to previous work, since less high cooperators and a differing proportion of conditional cooperation are found. However, this data confirms the reported proportion of free riders at about 25% of the population.

One pathway involves internal control of impulsive selfishness, and the other involves emotion-based prosocial preferences that are translated into behavior when they evade cognitive control for pursuing self-interest. We measured 443 participants’ overall prosocial behavior in four economic games. Participants’ predispositions [social value orientation (SVO)] were more strongly reflected in their overall game behavior when they made decisions quickly than when they spent a longer time. Prosocially (or selfishly) predisposed participants behaved less prosocially (or less selfishly) when they spent more time in decision making, such that their SVO prosociality yielded limited effects in actual behavior in their slow decisions. The increase (or decrease) in slower decision makers was prominent among consistent prosocials (or proselfs) whose strong preference for prosocial (or proself) goals would make it less likely to experience conflict between prosocial and proself goals. The strong effect of RT on behavior in consistent prosocials (or proselfs) suggests that conflict between prosocial and selfish goals alone is not responsible for slow decisions. Specifically, we found that contemplation of the risk of being exploited by others (social risk aversion) was partly responsible for making consistent prosocials (but not consistent proselfs) spend longer time in decision making and behave less prosocially. Conflict between means rather than between goals (immediate versus strategic pursuit of self-interest) was suggested to be responsible for the time-related increase in consistent proselfs’ prosocial behavior. The findings of this study are generally in favor of the intuitive cooperation model of prosocial behavior.

While the majority of previous studies equates reputation with a transparent and complete history of players’ past decisions, reputations in real life are often ambiguous and opaque. Using web-based experiments, we explore the extent to which opaque reputation works in isolating defectors, with and without partner selection opportunities. We found that low reputation works as a signal of untrustworthiness, whereas medium or high reputations are not taken into account by subjects for orienting their choices. Reputation without partner selection does not promote cooperative behavior; that is, defectors do not turn into cooperators only for the sake of getting a positive reputation. Finally, in a third study, when reputation is pivotal to selection, then a substantial proportion of would-be-defectors turn into cooperators. Taken together, these results provide insights about the characteristics of reputation and about the way in which humans make use of it when selecting partners, and also when knowing that they will be selected.

In Study 1 (N = 707), American participants who reported living under higher quality cooperation-enforcing institutions (police and courts) gave significantly more in a Dictator Game (DG), but did not punish significantly more in a Third-Party Punishment Game (TPPG). In Study 1R (N = 1705), we replicated the positive relationship between reported institutional quality and DG giving observed in Study 1.

Thus we present convergent evidence that the quality of institutions one is exposed to 'spills over' to subsequent prosociality but not punishment. These findings support a theory of social heuristics, suggest boundary conditions on spillover effects of cooperation, and demonstrate the power of effective institutions for instilling habits of virtue and creating cultures of cooperation.

We tested this idea in a laboratory experiment using public goods games in which one person in each group was selected to be a ‘‘designated punisher’’ who could give out material punishment that was either costly or costless to the punisher. Results show that costly punishment is perceived as more legitimate (proper) than costless punishment and that designated punishers engaged in more proper (‘‘prosocial’’) punishment and less abusive (‘‘antisocial’’) punishment when punishment was costly. These results highlight the importance of legitimacy in both motivating and regulating the enforcement of cooperation.

Participants’ behavior in response to a coplayer’s decisions was only affected by the degree of fairness, but not the SES, of respective coplayers.

The game involves two players, player 1 (P1) and player 2 (P2). In the first stage, P1 decides whether to trust and let P2 decide, or to secure an egalitarian payoff for both players. If P1 trusts P2, the latter can choose between a symmetric payoff that is double than the secure alternative discarded by P1, and an asymmetric payoff in which P2 earns more than in any other case but makes P1 worse off. Before the main experiment, we obtained participants’ scores for Abstract Reasoning (AR), risk attitudes, basic personality characteristics, and specific traits such as psychopathy and impulsivity. During the main experiment, we measured Heart Rate (HR) and ElectroDermal Activity (EDA) variation to account for emotional arousal caused by the decision and feedback processes. Our main findings indicate that, on one hand, P1 trust behavior associates to positive emotionality and, specifically, to the extraversion’s warmth facet. In addition, the impulsivity facet of positive urgency also favors trust behavior. No relation to trusting behavior was found for either other major personality aspects or risk attitudes. The physiological results show that participants scoring high in psychopathy exhibit increased EDA and reduced evoked HR deceleration at the moment in which they are asked to decide whether or not to trust. Regarding P2, we find that AR ability and mainly low disagreeable disinhibition favor reciprocal behavior. Specifically, lack of reciprocity significantly relates with a psychopathic, highly disinhibited and impulsive personality. Thus, the present study suggests that personality characteristics would play a significant role in different behaviors underlying cooperation, with extraversion/positive emotionality being more relevant for initiating cooperation, and low disagreeable disinhibition for maintaining it.

However, little is known about the neural substrates of such difficulties. In the last few years neuroeconomics, which combines imaging with multiplayer behavioural economic paradigms, has been used to study the neural substrates of normal and abnormal interpersonal interactions. Method: This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural activity in unmedicated depressed participants (n = 25) and matched healthy controls (n = 25). During scanning, participants played a behavioural economic game, the Prisoner's Dilemma. In this game, the participant and a co-player independently choose either to cooperate or not cooperate with each other. Results: Depressed participants reported higher levels of negative feelings (betrayal, guilt) during the game than did controls. Neural activation was compared between ‘imbalanced’ events [when one of the players cooperated and the other defected (‘CD’ and ‘DC’)] and ‘draw’ events [when both players either cooperated or defected (‘CC’ and ‘DD’)]. Participants preferentially activated the anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region implicated in cognitive control and regulation of emotions. Importantly, compared to controls depressed participants showed reduced activation in the left DLPFC, with the extent of signal reduction correlating with increased self-report feelings of guilt associated with DC outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that depression is associated with reduced activation of the DLPFC during social events that involve unreciprocated cooperation. This abnormality may underlie anomalies in cognitive control and top-down regulation of emotions during challenging social exchanges.

The internalized reciprocity norm assumption suggests that reciprocity disposition would encourage reciprocity towards strangers in one-shot interactions. To verify this, we examined the predictive ability of reciprocity dispositions for giving and repaying reciprocal behaviors. A sample of college students (N = 98) participated in the reciprocity game in a laboratory, which comprised a prisoner dilemma game (PD) and dictator game (DG). The results indicated that reciprocity behavior occurred among strangers without face-to-face interactions. Reciprocity expectation predicted the choice of cooperation in the PD significantly. Positive and negative reciprocity dispositions had no effect on the strategy choice; however, they significantly predicted payoff allocation in the DG. Specifically, a higher positive reciprocity disposition led to more payoff allocation, while a higher negative reciprocity disposition led to less payoff allocation. In summary, strangers abide by the reciprocity norm, and the internalized reciprocity disposition exerts an influence on repaying behavior and accounts for some individual differences in reciprocity. These findings provide robust support for the internalized reciprocity norm assumption, and illustrate the process mechanism of human interaction among strangers.

This study investigates how individuals learn to cooperate with reciprocating opponents. To do so, we evaluated individuals' expectations about the behavior of their opponents during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD). In four experiments, participants played with a Tit-For-Tat (TFT) algorithm that occasionally failed to reciprocate. In Experiment 1, we first established whether individuals actually develop expectations about their opponents by utilizing a concurrent task. Our results indicate that when the opponents did not reciprocate, participants engaged in greater cognitive processing and were slower to respond to the concurrent task. Experiment 2 examined whether delayed reciprocation affects expectations about reciprocation using similar methodology. Our results indicate that expectations were weaker when reciprocation was delayed. In Experiment 3, we investigated two possible paths through which people may learn to cooperate with TFT. Specifically, we investigated whether the expectations people develop concern their own payoffs or the behavior of their opponents. Our results indicate that participants' expectations concern both their own payoffs and opponents' behavior. In Experiment 4, we sought for convergent evidence and a finer temporal resolution by employing pupillometry. Our results indicate that participants exhibited greater pupil sizes when expectations about reciprocation were violated.

Chapter 1 investigates how different fairness concerns impact individual decisions to cooperate. I introduce a new version of the sequential prisoners dilemma where there is a chance the first movers choice is reversed. Experimental results show that second mover cooperation is higher when the first mover has little control over their choice and when the second mover is not told what the first mover chose. While subject behavior is consistent with concerns for fairness, the results indicate that these concerns work in ways not predicted by current theoretical models. Chapter 2 studies how prior ownership can in?uence bargaining over a jointly produced surplus. Experiments varied whether the proposer or responder received the surplus prior to bargaining and the strength of punishment. The results suggest that proposers respect prior ownership when the responder has a strong ability to punish, but not when punishment is weak. Responders respect prior ownership when their ability to punish is weak, but reject at high rates when they have strong punishment. I show that an independent measure of rule following can explain the results suggesting that individual behavior in bargaining is driven in part by adherence to social norms. Chapter 3 explores how guilt, shame, and theory of mind (ToM) in?uence adherence to social norms. Using psychometric measures, I explore how guilt, shame, and ToM are related to following prior ownership norms in a bargaining experiment. Guilt was not predictive of behavior; however, both shame and ToM were. Individuals who had greater feelings of shame were much more likely to respect prior ownership of responders and punish proposers who transgressed prior ownership of responders. Individuals who scored higher in ToM were much more likely to respect prior ownership by proposer. These results suggest that individual differences in shame and ToM are important in understanding adherence to bargaining norms.

Along this line, extensive studies have shown that reputation is an effective mechanism to investigate the evolution of cooperation. In most existing studies, participating individuals in a public goods game are assumed to contribute unconditionally into the public pool, or they can choose partners based on a common reputation standard (e.g., preferences or characters). However, to assign one reputation standard for all individuals is impractical in many real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce a reputation tolerance mechanism that allows an individual to select its potential partners and decide whether or not to contribute an investment to the public pool based on its tolerance to other individuals’ reputation. Specifically, an individual takes part in a public goods game only if the number of participants with higher reputation exceeds the value of its tolerance. Moreover, in this paper, an individual’s reputation can increase or decrease in a bounded interval based on its historical behaviors.We explore the principle that how the reputation tolerance and conditional investment mechanisms can affect the evolution of cooperation in spatial lattice networks. Our simulation results demonstrate that a larger tolerance value can achieve an environment that promote the cooperation of participants.

In Study 1, we used field experiments with farmers in Colombian villages exposed to different levels of violence to investigate how individual perceptions of insecurity affect cooperation, trust, reciprocity and altruism. To do so, we developed a cognitive-affective measure of subjective insecurity. We found that subjective insecurity has a negative effect on cooperation but influences trust and altruism positively. In Study 2, carried out three years after Study 1, we repeated the initial design with additional measures of victimization. Our goal was to relate subjective insecurity with actual victimization. The findings of Study 2 support the initial results, and are robust and consistent for cooperative behavior and trust when including victimization as a mediator. Different indicators of victimization are positively correlated with subjective insecurity and an aggregate index of victimization has a negative effect on cooperation but exerts a positive influence on trust.

We found a significant interaction effect on first-round cooperation, indicating larger cooperation rates when there is a negative outcome valence and a positive externality on others.

We ask how responsibility for group payoffs—in the absence of group deliberation—affects the choice. The experiment utilizes the Interdependent Security Dilemma paradigm. In its deterministic version, the game is identical to a finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma. In the stochastic version, potential losses are larger but uncertain, occurring with a predefined probability when one or both players choose to forgo investment in protection. Participants were assigned to play either as individuals, or as representatives of three‐person groups, with each member's choices equally likely to determine the group's payoffs. In the deterministic condition, individuals were more likely to invest (cooperate) than group representatives (80% vs. 62% of rounds). In the stochastic condition, the pattern was reversed as representatives were slightly, but not significantly, more likely to invest than individuals (46% vs. 40%). The significant interaction effect suggested that group representatives were not only less cooperative but also more risk averse than individuals. A follow‐up study supported this account by showing participants who construed the invest strategy as low‐risk than those who perceived this strategy to be high risk. Overall, group representatives exhibited a tendency to act more competitively and more cautiously than individuals acting alone.

Moral Foundations Theory has proven to be a useful means of categorizing ideas about morality and predicting opinions on aspects of social justice, political orientation, and other constructs related to prosocial behavior. This study sought to determine if Progressivism, the degree to which individuals endorse the individualizing moral foundations (i.e., Harm/Care and Fairness/Reciprocity) over the binding moral foundations (i.e., In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity), would lead to more frequent cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, a higher level of investment in the Trust Game, a higher level of return of one's partner's investment in the Trust Game, and fewer points stolen in the Thieves' Game. The results indicated no relationship between Progressivism and performance in the Thieves' Game. In three separate linear regressions controlling for age, gender, race, and Big-5 personality traits Progressivism was associated with more frequent cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, a higher level of investment in the Trust Game, and a higher level of return of one's partner's investment in the Trust Game. Therefore it does appear that moral foundations do predict performance in economic exchange games and that a greater endorsement of Progressivism is associated with more prosocial behavior.

Participants (N = 29) played two economic games with different incentive structures in the fMRI scanner after receiving OT or placebo (following a double blind, within-subject design). Pictures of angry or neutral faces (the social cues) were displayed alongside the game matrices. Consistent with a priori hypotheses based on the modulatory role of OT in mesolimbic dopaminergic brain regions, the results indicate that, compared to placebo, OT significantly increases the activation of the nucleus accumbens during an assurance (coordination) game that rewards mutual cooperation. This increases appetitive motivation so that cooperative behaviour is facilitated for risk averse individuals. OT also significantly attenuates the amygdala, thereby reducing the orienting response to social cues. The corresponding change in behaviour is only apparent in the chicken (or anti-coordination) game, where aggression is incentivized but fatal if the partner also aggresses. Because of this ambiguity, decision making can be improved by additional information, and OT steers decisions in the chicken game in accordance with the valence of the facial cue: aggress when face is neutral; retreat when it is angry. Through its combined influence on amygdala and nucleus accumbens, OT improves the selection of a cooperative or aggressive strategy in function of the best match between the incentives of the game and the social cues present in the decision environment.

This Registered Replication Report (RRR) assessed the size and variability of the effect of time pressure on cooperative decisions by combining 21 separate, preregistered replications of the critical conditions from Study 7 of the original article (Rand et al., 2012). The primary planned analysis used data from all participants who were randomly assigned to conditions and who met the protocol inclusion criteria (an intent-to-treat approach that included the 65.9% of participants in the time-pressure condition and 7.5% in the forced-delay condition who did not adhere to the time constraints), and we observed a difference in contributions of −0.37 percentage points compared with an 8.6 percentage point difference calculated from the original data. Analyzing the data as the original article did, including data only for participants who complied with the time constraints, the RRR observed a 10.37 percentage point difference in contributions compared with a 15.31 percentage point difference in the original study. In combination, the results of the intent-to-treat analysis and the compliant-only analysis are consistent with the presence of selection biases and the absence of a causal effect of time pressure on cooperation.

By design, the expected marginal net benefits to an individual and the expected harm to others depends endogenously on the individuals’ expectations of group cooperation and exogenously on the magnitude of the loss parameter. We find that individual cooperation is greater when forecasts of total group cooperation are greater and where the magnitude of the probabilistic loss is larger. There is, however, an interesting asymmetry in responses by two subgroups. Subjects who are pessimistic regarding total group cooperation decrease cooperation the higher the magnitude of the probabilistic loss and their decisions are tied systematically to changes in their expectations of other’s cooperation.

A breakthrough can be achieved by revealing the microfoundations of sociality, an additional component of the utility function reflecting the value of contributing to group success derived from social identity. Building upon our previous behavioral work, we conduct a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N = 10 in the Pilot Study and N = 15 in the Main Study) to measure whether and how sociality alters the functional activation of and connectivity between specific systems in the brain. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that sociality, even in a minimal form, serves as a natural mechanism of sustainable cooperation by fostering interaction between brain regions associated with social cognition and those related to value calculation. We use group-based manipulations to induce varying levels of sociality and compare behavior in two social dilemmas: Prisoner’s Dilemma and variations of Ultimatum Game. We find that activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, a region previously associated with cognitive control and modulation of the valuation system, is correlated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to a greater degree when participants make economic decisions in a game with an acquaintance, high sociality condition, compared to a game with a random individual, low sociality condition. These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism through which sociality facilitates cooperation, fairness and provision of public goods at the cost of individual gain. Future research should examine neural dynamics in the brain during the computation of utility in the context of strategic games that involve social interaction for a larger sample of subjects.

Research has found that third-party punishment is subject to intergroup bias, whereby people punish members of the out-group more severely than the in-group. Although the prevalence of this behavior is well-documented, the psychological processes underlying it remain largely unexplored. Some work suggests that it stems from people’s inherent predisposition to form alliances with in-group members and aggress against out-group members. This implies that people will show reflexive intergroup bias in third-party punishment, favoring in-group over out-group members especially when their capacity for deliberation is impaired. Here we test this hypothesis directly, examining whether intergroup bias in third-party punishment emerges from reflexive, as opposed to deliberative, components of moral cognition. In 3 experiments, utilizing a simulated economic game, we varied participants’ group relationship to a transgressor, measured or manipulated the extent to which they relied on reflexive or deliberative judgment, and observed people’s punishment decisions. Across group-membership manipulations (American football teams, nationalities, and baseball teams) and 2 assessments of reflexive judgment (response time and cognitive load), reflexive judgment heightened intergroup bias, suggesting that such bias in punishment is inherent to human moral cognition. We discuss the implications of these studies for theories of punishment, cooperation, social behavior, and legal practice.

When participants are allowed to develop reputations in the experiments, as is the case in most small-scale societies, we find that sharing is increasingly directed toward individuals experiencing hardship, good reputations increase aid, and the pooling of resources through voluntary sharing becomes more effective. We also find high levels of voluntary sharing without a strong commitment device; however, this form of cooperation does not increase contributions to the public good. Our results are consistent with previous experiments and theoretical models, suggesting strategic risks tied to rewards, punishments, and reputations are important. However, unlike studies that focus solely on strategic risks, we find the effects of rewards, punishments, and reputations are altered by the presence of environmental factors.

In this article, we present two experiments that study participants’ experience of guilt and envy when engaging in social decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game.

Three experiments test elements of the proposed theory by varying the context in which actors viewed themselves, their partners, and the overall goals of their groups. The instructions for study 1 told groups of actors that they either had cooperative or competitive personality types. Study 2 referred to the partners of actors as either collaborators or competitors. Study 3 told actors the goals of their groups were either defined by cooperation or competition. Each study assigned actors to the same group structure in which individuals completed a public goods game with opportunities to anonymously punish their partners. Results show that actors contributed more resources to their group, and spent fewer resources punishing their partners, when they viewed themselves or their partners as more cooperative than competitive. These behaviors, in turn, affected levels of trust, commitment, and cohesion that formed between group members. The context in which actors viewed the goals of their groups affected their contributions to these groups, but it did not significantly affect their punishment of partners. These patterns of behaviors also had negligible effects on social solidarity in groups. Thus, results from these experiments show that subtle features of the relational context (i.e. perceptions of self and partners) affect the means by which actors promote collective action in groups, shaping the formation of social solidarity between group members.

We propose that the benefits of maintaining a positive reputation are not limited by group boundaries and so people may cooperate to maintain a good reputation among outgroup members when they will meet and interact with members of that group again. According to this unbounded indirect reciprocity perspective, reputation can promote cooperation with both ingroup and outgroup members. Alternatively, social identity theory (SIT) favors social identity versus reputation as an explanation for cooperation among ingroup members. We test these hypotheses across five studies (Ns = 619, 607, 613, 360, and 615) that manipulate reputation, social identification, and partner's group membership in a cooperative decision making task. Across our studies, people were more cooperative with both ingroup and outgroup members when their reputation was at stake (Studies 1–5), and reputational concern mediated the effect of cues of gossip on cooperation in interactions with ingroup and outgroup members (Studies 1–4). Social identification did not affect cooperation with ingroup members.

The control group demonstrated significantly lower cooperation rates under negative payoffs, compared with the version with only positive payoffs, indicative of loss aversion. The patient group on average showed no loss aversion response. Moreover, the extent of loss aversion in patients was found to be negatively correlated with schizophrenia illness severity, with less ill patients showing loss aversion more similar to controls. Results were found to be robust to the inclusion of potential confounding factors as covariates within rigorous probit regression analyses.

Study 1 suggested that resource information is more valuable than social information, in that if the resource can be monitored, whether or not others’ choices can also be monitored has no impact on behavior. However, if the state of the resource is not known, the ability to know what others are doing is critical for cooperation. This seems to be because resource information encourages planning and long-term thinking, and social information encourages comparative thinking. Study 2 replicated the behavior pattern, revealed—surprisingly—that warnings that a resource is critically low undermine (rather than promote) cooperation, and that such responses depend on the availability of social and environmental information. Discussion focuses on how incomplete information about a resource might be addressed.

In four studies, participants received information about others' decision times (fast or slow) and were asked to estimate how much they contributed to a common pool. People believe fast decisions are more extreme than slow decisions; in other words, they assume that fast decisions are either extremely selfish or extremely cooperative. People also believe that fast deciders are less moral (Studies 1 and 2) and less conflicted (Study 2) than slow deciders. Beliefs about decision time depend on whether time can be attributed to self-paced reaction times or external time constraints. When decisions are made under external time constraints, time has inconsistent or heterogeneous effects on behavioral expectations (Study 2). Decision time also moderates the effects of other informational cues: Positive facial expressions and perceptions of trustworthiness have stronger effects on expectations when paired with fast decisions (Study 3). Finally, observed decision time also has behavioral consequences—people make more extreme decisions when interacting with a partner who decided quickly (Study 4).

Because the presence of a dog has been shown to have positive effects on mood and dyadic interaction, we expected that the presence of a companion dog would also have positive effects on people in work groups. One reason for this is that a companion dog is likely to elevate positive emotions, which often promote prosocial behavior. In study 1 (n = 120) and study 2 (n = 120), participants were randomly assigned to either a dog-present or dog-absent four-person group. Three friendly companion dogs were randomly assigned to the dog-present groups; only one dog at a time was used during any given experimental session. In study 1, groups worked on an interactive problem-solving task; participants in the dog-present group displayed more verbal cohesion, physical intimacy, and cooperation.

First, pro-social effects might require in-phase synchrony or simply coordination. Second, the effects of rhythmic movements on cooperation might be direct or mediated by an intervening variable. Third, the pro-social effects might occur in proportion to the quality of the coordination, or occur once some threshold amount of coordination has occurred. We report an experiment and two follow-ups which sought to identify which classes of models are required to account for the positive effects of coordinated rhythmic movement on cooperation.

Participants interacted over 30 rounds in fixed groups with fixed identifiers that allowed them to trace other group members’ behavior over time. The two dimensions of communication we study are asking for a specific contribution level and having to express oneself when choosing to counter-punish. We conduct four experimental treatments, all involving a contribution stage, a punishment stage, and a counter-punishment stage in each round. In the first treatment communication is not possible at any of the stages. The second treatment allows participants to ask for a contribution level at the punishment stage and in the third treatment participants are required to send a message if they decide to counter-punish. The fourth combines the two communication channels of the second and third treatments. We find that the three treatments involving communication at any of the two relevant stages lead to significantly higher contributions than the baseline treatment. We find no difference between the three treatments with communication. We also relate our results to previous results from treatments without counter-punishment opportunities and do not find that the presence of counter-punishment leads to lower cooperation level. The overall pattern of results shows that given fixed identifiers the key factor is the presence of communication. Whenever communication is possible contributions and earnings are higher than when it is not, regardless of counter-punishment opportunities.

long-standing conundrum that has been amply studied both theoretically
and experimentally. Within the question, a less explored issue relates
to the gender dependence of cooperation, which can be traced back to
Darwin, who stated that ``women are less selfish but men are more
competitive{''}. Indeed, gender has been shown to be relevant in several
game theoretical paradigms of social cooperativeness, including
prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and ultimatum/dictator games, but there is
no consensus as to which gender is more cooperative. We here contribute
to this literature by analyzing the role of gender in a repeated
Prisoners' Dilemma played by Spanish high-school students in both a
square lattice and a heterogeneous network. While the experiment was
conducted to shed light on the influence of networks on the emergence of
cooperation, we benefit from the availability of a large dataset of more
1200 participants. We applied different standard econometric techniques
to this dataset, including Ordinary Least Squares and Linear Probability
models including random effects. All our analyses indicate that being
male is negatively associated with the level of cooperation, this
association being statistically significant at standard levels. We also
obtain a gender difference in the level of cooperation when we control
for the unobserved heterogeneity of individuals, which indicates that
the gender gap in cooperation favoring female students is present after
netting out this effect from other socio-demographics factors not
controlled for in the experiment, and from gender differences in risk,

levels. Two distinct forms of behavioral coordination have been
empirically linked with affiliation and cooperation during or following
face-to-face interaction: behavior matching and interpersonal synchrony.
Only the latter form constitutes behavioral entrainment involving a
coupling between independent oscillators. We present the first study of
the association between spontaneously occurring behavioral coordination
and post-interaction economic game play. Triads of same-sexed strangers
conversed for 10 min, after which each participant played an unannounced
one-shot prisoner's dilemma (PD) toward each co-participant. When dyads
had higher language style matching scores (LSM: Gonzales, A.L., Hancock,
J.T., \& Pennebaker, J.W. (2010). Language style matching as a predictor
of social dynamics in small groups. Communication Research, 31, 3-19),
the individuals evaluated each other more positively, but they were no
more likely to cooperate in the PD. However, when dyads' speech rates
(mean syllable duration) converged more strongly from the beginning to
the end of the conversation, they were more likely to cooperate in the
PD, despite no effect on interpersonal evaluations. Speech rate
convergence, a form of rhythmic entrainment, could benefit interlocutors
by mutually reducing cognitive processing during interaction. We suggest
that spontaneous, temporally based behavioral coordination might
facilitate prosocial behavior when the joint cooperative effort is
itself perceived as a form of coordination. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

microexpression analysis, defection was strongly linked with depressed
lower lips and less opened eyes. Significant correlation was found
between the intensity of micromimics and the rating of images in the

considered as reliable indicators of momentary social dispositions in

individuals with mental illnesses such as depression. For decades,
researchers have used economic game paradigms to compare cross-cultural
cooperative behavior. However, research using economic games to assess
cooperative behavior in clinical populations is in the early stages. We
hypothesized that individuals with greater depressive symptoms would
struggle to maintain reciprocity in iterative games, but not in
single-iteration games measuring personal values.
Methods: Participants (n=41) played four computer-based economic games
(prisoner's dilemma, the public goods game, the ultimatum game, and the
trust game) measuring different aspects of cooperation. Participants
completed the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) and other
measures of personality and demographics. Analyses assessed the
relationships between game performance and psychological distress as
measured by the DASS.
Results: Significant correlations were found between game performance
and depressive symptoms, but not symptoms of anxiety or stress.
Performance in the prisoner's dilemma and public goods game was
significantly related to depression in a linear regression even when
known associations with depressive affect such as age, gender, race,
education, marital status, and neuroticism were controlled for
Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were associated with an inability to
sustain reciprocal cooperation. Participants showed the predicted
deficits in cooperation in these economic games. Economic games show the
potential for assessing the social deficits associated with depressive
symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000324038000069,{3},,{ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000324038000069},{213ER},{J. Affect. Disord.},{32},{1},{21},{27},"{This study was funded by University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department

develops a version of the Self- and Other-Interest Inventory for use
with a general population and demonstrates systematic changes in the
relation between self- and other-interest scores with age. Study 3 shows
that self- and other-interest scores vary independently, as a function
of the accessibility of related values. Study 4 provides evidence that
self- interest scores predict behaviors that benefit the self and that
other-interest scores predict behaviors that benefit another person.
Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that in situations that involve a
trade-off between the pursuit of self- interest and the pursuit of
other-interest, such as the prisoner's dilemma, self- and other-interest
scores contribute independently to behavioral prediction.}",article,ISI:000323285600008,{3},,{AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000323285600008},{203IM},{J. Pers. Soc. Psychol.},{69},{3},{51},{83},,,"{Gerbasi, Margaret/0000-0003-1786-6962}",,"{mgerbasi@princeton.edu

the classic prisoner's dilemma game? In this article, we explore whether
the costs and benefits of legal representation are such that each party
seeks legal representation in the hope of exploiting the other party,
while knowing full well that failing to do so will open up the
possibility of being exploited. The article first shows how it is
possible to test for the presence of such an incentive structure in a
typical dispute resolution system. It then reports estimates of the
incentives for the parties to obtain legal representation in wage
disputes that were settled by final-offer arbitration in New Jersey. The
article also reports briefly on similar studies of data from discharge
grievances, court-annexed disputes in Pittsburgh, and child custody
disputes in California. In each case, the data provide evidence that the
parties face strong individual incentives to obtain legal representation
that make the parties jointly worse off. Using our New Jersey data, we
find that expert agents may well have played a productive role in
moderating the biases of their clients, but only early on in the history
of the system. Over time, the parties slowly evolved to a noncooperative
equilibrium where the use of lawyers becomes nearly universal, despite
the fact that agreeing not to hire lawyers is cheaper and does not
appear to alter arbitration outcomes.}",article,ISI:000323198600001,{3},,{WILEY},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000323198600001},{202FI},{J. Empir Leg. Stud},{11},{0},{4},{45},,,,,{gdahl@ucsd.edu},{Law},{Government \& Law},"{ARBITRATOR BEHAVIOR; FINAL-OFFER; SETTLEMENT; LITIGATION; OUTCOMES;

a purely rational phenomenon, common sense suggests that emotions affect
our decision-making particularly in a social context. To explore the
influence of emotions on economic decision-making, we manipulated
opponent-directed emotions prior to engaging participants in two social
exchange decision-making games (the Trust Game and the Prisoner's
Dilemma). Participants played both games with three different
(fictional) partners and their tendency to defect was measured. Prior to
playing each game, participants exchanged handwritten ``essays{''} with
their partners, and subsequently exchanged evaluations of each essay.
The essays and evaluations, read by the participant, were designed to
induce either anger, sympathy, or a neutral emotional response toward
the confederate with whom they would then play the social exchange
games. Galvanic skin conductance level (SCL) showed enhanced
physiological arousal during anger induction compared to both the
neutral and sympathy conditions. In both social exchange games,
participants were most likely to defect against their partner after
anger induction and least likely to defect after sympathy induction,
with the neutral condition eliciting intermediate defection rates. This
pattern was found to be strongest in participants exhibiting low
cognitive control (as measured by a Go/no-Go task). The findings
indicate that emotions felt toward another individual alter how one
chooses to interact with them, and that this influence depends both on
the specific emotion induced and the cognitive control of the
individual.}",article,ISI:000331168600001,,,{FRONTIERS MEDIA SA},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted}",{ISI:000331168600001},{AA5VV},{Front. Psychol.},{27},{0},{3},{80},,,,,"{i.eimontaite@2011.hull.ac.uk

this idea. First, we recorded 60-s videos of participants, and then

Subsequently, raters viewed these videos, with the sound either off or

tendency to guess that attractive players chose stag. In contrast to the
prediction, rater accuracy was at chance regardless of whether the sound
of the video was off or on. For prisoner's dilemma players, raters
showed a significant tendency to guess that women cooperated at a higher
rate than men. Again in contrast to the prediction, accuracy was
significantly above chance in this case. To calibrate the importance of
this accuracy rate, we developed two models that suggest the accuracy we
observed in the prisoner's dilemma case is probably not high enough to
support the evolution of cooperation. Altogether, our results show that
raters tried to achieve a meaningful degree of accuracy about players by
using the limited information available in the videos, but they could

treatment of a range of simple game theoretic characterizations of
international climate negotiations. The authors use the Nash and
Maxi-min stability definitions to analyze 25 two-by-two ordinal games,
which they recognize as ``possible game-theoretic characterizations of
climate negotiations between two players (e.g., Great Powers or
coalitions of states){''}. The authors' main conclusion that the
Prisoner's Dilemma might not be the best description of climate
negotiations game is consistent with the findings of others who have
studied two-by-two conflicts over natural commons (Bardhan, 1993;
Madani, 2010; Sandler, 1992; Taylor, 1987). Nevertheless, given the
importance of the climate change issue, as well as the potential effects
of our actions on the state of the environment and the well-being of
future generations, I would like to address some gaps in their analysis,
which result in it having limited usefulness for policy purposes. Of
course, all models are simplified representations of reality, full of
limitations. ``Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are
useful{''} (Box and Draper, 1987). So, ``the practical question is how
wrong do they have to be to not be useful{''} (Box and Draper, 1987).
Models' limitations need to be carefully considered when interpreting
them or applying their results to policy but some models are too simple
to provide useful policy advice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

measure of attribute chronicity, we found that individuals for whom
trustworthiness was a chronic trait were better able to distinguish
cheaters from cooperators in a real life prisoner's dilemma game.

unappreciated implications for understanding the selective advantage of
psychopathic traits. Although clinical psychopathy is typically
construed as a strategy of unconditional defection, subclinical
psychopathy may promote strategic conditional defection, broadening the
adaptive niche of psychopathy within human societies. To test this, we
focus on a ubiquitous real-life source of conditional behaviour: the
expected relational value of social partners, both in terms of their
quality and the likely quantity of future interactions with them. We
allow for conversational interaction among participants prior to their
playing an unannounced, one-shot prisoner's dilemma game, which fosters
naturalistic interpersonal evaluation and conditional behaviour, while
controlling punishment and reputation effects. Individuals scoring
higher on factor 1 (callous affect, interpersonal manipulation) of the
Levenson self-report psychopathy scale defected conditionally on two
kinds of low-value partners: those who interrupted them more during the
conversation, and those with whom they failed to discover cues to future
interaction. Both interaction effects support the hypothesis that
subclinical primary psychopathy potentiates defection on those with low
expected relational value. These data clarify the function and form of
psychopathic traits, while highlighting adaptive variation in human
social strategies.}",article,ISI:000315953700004,{1757},,{ROYAL SOC},,,{2020-11-04},"{Green Published, Bronze}",{ISI:000315953700004},{103XV},{Proc. R. Soc. B-Biol. Sci.},{52},{0},{33},{72},"{All procedures used in this study were approved by the UCLA

with others but to protect the self; effective social functioning often
requires reconciling the resulting ambivalence between these motives.
Attachment anxiety is characterized by chronically heightened concerns

behavior. Method We used the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Assurance Game
to examine how the ambivalence associated with attachment anxiety
affects pro-social behavior, comparing chronic attachment anxiety with
both chronic (Study 1; N?=?94) and contextually activated (Study 2;

ambivalent behavior in the social dilemma games. Specifically, the
chronically anxious were mistrustfully inconsistent in their strategic
choices and took more time to make these choices. However, priming the
chronically anxious with attachment security decreased ambivalence by
promoting more fluent cooperative behavior. Conclusions To our
knowledge, these are the first studies to examine the effect of the
anxiously attached's chronic relational ambivalence on pro-social
behavior. These findings illustrate that the simultaneous activation of
affiliation and self-protection can have interpersonal consequences,
increasing mistrust and hesitance. Importantly, however, we were able to
attenuate these effects by priming felt security.}",article,ISI:000313914400009,{1},,{WILEY},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000313914400009},{075VF},{J.

behavior in intergroup conflict in humans frequently make use of the
assumption that warfare can be modeled as a symmetrical n-person
prisoner's dilemma, abstracting away the strategic differences between
attack and defense. In contrast, some empirical studies on intergroup
conflict in hunter-gatherer societies and chimpanzees indicate that
fitness relevant risks and potential benefits of attacks and defenses
might have differed substantially under ancestral conditions. Drawing on
these studies, it is hypothesized that the success of defenses was much
more important for individual and kin survival and that a disposition to
act altruistically during intergroup conflict is thus more likely to
evolve for the strategic situation of defense. It is then investigated
empirically if such asymmetries in the occurrence of altruistic behavior
during intergroup conflict can be found. Analyzing detailed historical
case data from 20th century wars, this study finds that altruistic
behavior towards members of the in-group indeed seems to occur more
frequently when soldiers are defending themselves and their comrades
against enemy attacks. It is proposed that this asymmetry reflects
adaptive behavioral responses to the materially different strategic
character of attacks and defenses under ancestral conditions. If true,
this would call for a refinement of theories of the evolutionary
interaction of intergroup conflict and altruism.}",article,ISI:000328121200004,{5},,{SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC},,,{2020-11-04},{DOAJ Gold},{ISI:000328121200004},{267TO},{Evol.

the group but is costly to the individual (relative to defection), yet a

people do value rewards to others, albeit at a discounted rate (social
discounting), in a manner similar to discounting of delayed rewards
(delay discounting). Two experiments opposed the personal benefit from
defection to the socially discounted benefit to others from cooperation.
The benefit to others was determined from a social discount function
relating the individual's subjective value of a reward to another person
and the social distance between that individual and the other person. In
Experiment 1, the cost of cooperating was held constant while its social
benefit was varied in terms of the number of other players, each gaining
a fixed, hypothetical amount of money. In Experiment 2, the cost of
cooperating was again held constant while the social benefit of
cooperating was varied by the hypothetical amount of money earned by a

with complex social relationships have driven the evolution of
sophisticated cognitive processes in primates. We investigated how the
size of cooperative primate communities depends on the memory of each of
its members and on the pressure exerted by natural selection. To this
end we devised an evolutionary game theoretical model in which social
interactions are modelled in terms of a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma
played by individuals who may exhibit a different memory capacity. Here,
memory is greatly simplified and mapped onto a single parameter m
describing the number of conspecifics whose previous action each
individual can remember. We show that increasing m enables cooperation
to emerge and be maintained in groups of increasing sizes. Furthermore,
harsher social dilemmas lead to the need for a higher m in order to
ensure high levels of cooperation. Finally, we show how the interplay
between the dilemma individuals face and their memory capacity m allows
us to define a critical group size below which cooperation may thrive,
and how this value depends sensitively on the strength of natural
selection. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

in the extent to which people punish, little is known about why some

whether personality traits might contribute to variation in helping and
punishment behavior. We first replicate a previous study using public
goods scenarios to investigate effects of sex, relatedness and
likelihood of future interaction on willingness to help a group member
or to punish a transgressor. As in the previous study, we find that
individuals are more willing to help related than unrelated needy others
and that women are more likely to express desire to help than men.
Desire to help was higher if the probability of future interaction is
high, at least among women. In contrast, among these variables, only
participant sex predicted some measures of punitive sentiment. Extending
the replication, we found that punitive sentiment, but not willingness
to help, was predicted by personality traits. Most notably, participants
scoring lower on Agreeableness expressed more anger towards and greater
desire to punish a transgressor, and were more willing to engage in
costly punishment, at least in our scenario. Our results suggest that
some personality traits may contribute to underpinning individual
variation in social enforcement of cooperation.}",article,ISI:000317897300016,{1},,{SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC},,,{2020-11-04},{DOAJ Gold},{ISI:000317897300016},{130FC},{Evol. Psychol.},{48},{0},{4},{48},,,"{Roberts, Craig/0000-0002-9641-6101

were sufficient to produce large effects, while subsequent increases to

For standard prisoner's dilemma payoffs, we also found that
assortativity resulted predominantly from cooperators avoiding
defectors, not by severing ties with defecting partners, and that
cooperation correspondingly suffered. Finally, by modifying the payoffs

between a particular smaller-sooner reinforcer and a more abstract,
temporally extended, but larger reinforcer. In two experiments, the
extent to which the availability of commitment responses-self-imposed
restrictions on future choices-might improve self-control in such
situations was investigated. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma
game against a computer that played a tit-for-tat strategy-cooperating
after a participant cooperated, defecting after a participant defected.
Defecting produced a small-immediate reinforcer (consisting of points
convertible to gift cards) whereas cooperating increased the amount of
subsequent reinforcers, yielding a greater overall reinforcer rate.
Participants were normally free to cooperate or defect on each trial.
Additionally, they could choose to make a commitment response that
forced their choice for the ensuing five trials. For sonic participants,
the commitment response forced cooperation; for others, it forced
defection. Most participants, with either commitment response available,
chose to commit repeatedly despite a minor point loss for doing so.
After extended exposure to these contingencies, the commit-to-cooperate
group cooperated significantly more than a control group (with no
commitment available). The commit-to-defect group cooperated
significantly less than the control group. When both commitment
alternatives were simultaneously available-one for cooperation and one
for defection-cooperation commitment was strongly preferred. In
Experiment 2, the commitment alternative was removed at the end of the
session; gains in cooperation, relative to the con trol group, were not
sustained in the absence of the self-imposed behavioral scaffold.}",article,ISI:000307206000005,{1},,{SOC EXP ANALYSIS BEHAVIOR INC},,,{2020-11-04},{Green Published},{ISI:000307206000005},{984QL},{J.

behavior. If this strategy fails to produce mutual cooperation, they may
increase punishment magnitude. The present experiment investigated
whether delay reductionpotentially less harmful than magnitude

The participants played a prisoner's dilemma game against a computer
that played a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperating after a participant
cooperated, defecting after a participant defected. For half the
participants, the delay between their choice and the computer's next
choice was long relative to the delay between the computer's choice and
their next choice. For the other half, long and short delays were
reversed. The tit-for-tat contingency reinforces the other player's
cooperation (by cooperating) and punishes the other player's defection
(by defecting). Both the rewards and the punishments are discounted by
delay. Consistent with delay discounting, the participants cooperated
more when the delay between their choice and the computer's cooperation
(reward) or defection (punishment) was relatively short. These results
suggest that, in real-world tit-for-tat conflicts, the decreasing delay
of reciprocation or retaliation may foster mutual cooperation as
effectively as (or more effectively than) the more usual tactic of
increasing magnitude of reciprocation or retaliation. Copyright (C) 2011

approach incorporating trust, regret and guilt}",,,{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},,"Djulbegovic, Benjamin and Hozo, Iztok","{Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain an indispensable
form of human experimentation as a vehicle for discovery of new
treatments. However, since their inception RCTs have raised ethical
concerns. The ethical tension has revolved around ``duties to
individuals{''} vs. ``societal value{''} of RCTs. By asking current
patients ``to sacrifice for the benefit of future patients{''} we risk
subjugating our duties to patients' best interest to the utilitarian
goal for the good of others. This tension creates a key dilemma: when is
it rational, from the perspective of the trial patients and researchers
(as societal representatives of future patients), to enroll in RCTs?
Methods: We employed the trust version of the prisoner's dilemma since
interaction between the patient and researcher in the setting of a
clinical trial is inherently based on trust. We also took into account
that the patient may have regretted his/her decision to participate in
the trial, while a researcher may feel guilty because he/she abused the
patient's trust.
Results: We found that under typical circumstances of clinical research,
most patients can be expected not to trust researchers, and most
researchers can be expected to abuse the patients' trust. The most
significant factor determining trust was the success of experimental or
standard treatments, respectively. The more that a researcher believes
the experimental treatment will be successful, the more incentive the
researcher has to abuse trust. The analysis was sensitive to the
assumptions about the utilities related to success and failure of
therapies that are tested in RCTs. By varying all variables in the Monte
Carlo analysis we found that, on average, the researcher can be expected
to honor a patient's trust 41\% of the time, while the patient is
inclined to trust the researcher 69\% of the time. Under assumptions of
our model, enrollment into RCTs represents a rational strategy that can
meet both patients' and researchers' interests simultaneously 19\% of
the time.
Conclusions: There is an inherent ethical dilemma in the conduct of
RCTs. The factors that hamper full cooperation between patients and
researchers in the conduct of RCTs can be best addressed by: a) having
more reliable estimates on the probabilities that new vs. established
treatments will be successful, b) improving transparency in the clinical
trial system to ensure fulfillment of ``the social contract{''} between
patients and researchers.}",article,ISI:000311153900001,,,{BMC},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000311153900001},{038CX},{BMC Med. Res. Methodol.},{12},{0},{5},{73},,,"{Hozo, ihozo@iun.edu/0000-0003-2349-5707

defection potentially yields outcomes of higher variance (and vice
versa, for cooperation-unfriendly environments). In line with this
hypothesis, we showed, in two experiments and a reanalysis of a study by
Fudenberg, Rand, and Dreber ( in press), that the degree of cooperation
increases with dispositional risk aversion in cooperation-friendly

functional connectivity with the anterior insula relative to placebo,
which may increase the amygdala's ability to elicit visceral somatic
markers that guide decision making. These findings extend our knowledge

and benefit to recipient}",,,{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY},{1471-2148},"Schneeberger, Karin and Dietz, Melanie and Taborsky, Michael","{Background: Although evolutionary models of cooperation build on the
intuition that costs of the donor and benefits to the receiver are the
most general fundamental parameters, it is largely unknown how they
affect the decision of animals to cooperate with an unrelated social
partner. Here we test experimentally whether costs to the donor and need
of the receiver decide about the amount of help provided by unrelated
rats in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game.
Results: Fourteen unrelated Norway rats were alternately presented to a
cooperative or defective partner for whom they could provide food via a
mechanical apparatus. Direct costs for this task and the need of the
receiver were manipulated in two separate experiments. Rats provided
more food to cooperative partners than to defectors (direct
reciprocity). The propensity to discriminate between helpful and
non-helpful social partners was contingent on costs: An experimentally
increased resistance in one Newton steps to pull food for the social
partner reduced the help provided to defectors more strongly than the
help returned to cooperators. Furthermore, test rats provided more help
to hungry receivers that were light or in poor condition, which might
suggest empathy, whereas this relationship was inverse when experimental
partners were satiated.
Conclusions: In a prisoner's dilemma situation rats seem to take effect
of own costs and potential benefits to a receiver when deciding about
helping a social partner, which confirms the predictions of reciprocal
cooperation. Thus, factors that had been believed to be largely confined
to human social behaviour apparently influence the behaviour of other
social animals as well, despite widespread scepticism. Therefore our
results shed new light on the biological basis of reciprocity.}",article,ISI:000303320100001,,,{BMC},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000303320100001},{932WB},{BMC Evol. Biol.},{78},{1},{53},{45},,,"{Taborsky, Michael/0000-0002-1357-4316

projection (using one's own mental states to intuit a counterpart's
mental states) and stereotyping (using general assumptions about a group
to intuit a counterpart's mental states). Study 1 extends prior work on
perceptual dilemmas in arms races, examining Americans' perceptions of
Chinese attitudes toward military escalation. Study 2 adapts a

employs an ultimatum game, asking male and female participants to make

similarity as well as counterpart stereotype in a principal-agent
context. Across the studies, we find evidence for our central
prediction: higher levels of perceived similarity are associated with
increased projection and reduced stereotyping. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

their views shape their behavior. Seven studies show that people's
mental representations of conflict are predictably constrained to a
small set of possibilities with important behavioral and social
consequences. Studies 1 and 2 found that, when prompted to represent a
conflict in matrix form, more than 70\% of the people created 1 of 4
archetypal mixed-motive games (out of 576 possibilities): Maximizing
Difference, Assurance, Chicken, and Prisoner's Dilemma. Study 3
demonstrated that these mental representations relate in predictable
ways to negotiators' fixed-pie perceptions. Studies 4-6 showed that
these mental representations shape individuals' behavior and
interactions with others, including cooperation, perspective taking, and
use of deception in negotiation, and through them, conflict's outcomes.
Study 7 found that the games that people think they are playing
influence how their counterparts see them, as well as their
counterparts' negotiation expectations. Overall, the findings document
noteworthy regularities in people's mental representations of outcome
interdependence in conflict and illustrate that 4 archetypal games can

whether Theory of Mind (TOM), the ability to represent mental states of

Participants completed a ToM task and were asked to assess either video
clips of people playing a variation of a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game
(Study 1, N = 88), or photographs of people playing PD taken at the very
moment when they were expressing a decision to cooperate or to defect
(Study 2, N = 99). We found relationships between ToM and cooperative
intention recognition only in Study 1, when participants were exposed to
long versions of the video clips. In contrast to previous reports,
participants in our samples did not score higher than chance in
cooperativeness assessment except for Study 1 in the condition with
short video clips. Our results question human expertise at identifying
defectors and cooperators and do not provide clear support for an

decision-making in two types of cooperation games: a prisoner's dilemma
(PD) eliciting a temptation to free-ride, leading to a dominant,
self-interested response, and a stag hunt (SH) that has no dominant
response but offers pay-off incentives that make mutual cooperation
collectively beneficial but risky. Consequently, the PD poses greater
conflict between self-and collective interest, greater demands for
computational reasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater
demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent
with these differences between the two games, the results indicate that
the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate
gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction.
With less conflict, the demands for computation and mentalizing are
reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The
differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentive

More importantly, the effect of inequality was different among groups with different distributions of resources—cooperation declined in groups with a symmetrical distribution of resources but did not decline in groups with a hegemonic distribution. Hegemonic distribution also affected psychological states as resource inequality changed. High endowment members reported higher self-efficacy when distribution was hegemonic than symmetric. However, they also reported more fear of being a sucker in hegemonic groups.

Results from two laboratory experiments provide consistent support for our hypothesis. Specifically, we found that cooperation (in groups that adopted sanctioning systems, including both reward and punishment) decreased significantly following the removal of sanctioning systems. We also found that a moral appeal to cooperate was as effective as sanctions in inducing cooperation. Moreover, cooperation induced through appeals was more likely to sustain than that induced through sanctions. We found that people’s trust in others’ cooperation mediated the relationship between the use of sanctions and appeals and the level of cooperation after these inducing practices were removed.

Actors in social dilemmas are typically confronted with two choices: to cooperate with group interests, often at some expense of self-interest, or to free-ride off others' cooperation. A dilemma thus ensues in that the individually rational strategy of free-riding leads to failure in the group's efforts to achieve the desired ends of its members. In this dissertation, I focus on actors' perceptions of free-riding. Specifically, I use Markovsky's (1985) multilevel justice theory to compare the effects of emphasizing actual contributions to the group effort versus contributions relative to ability to contribute. I argue that focusing on absolute contributions makes actors more sympathetic toward group members with the least to contribute to the group. Focusing on relative contributions, however, shifts actors' sympathies toward those with the most to contribute to the group. I conducted two experiments to test for these effects. In Experiment 1, I focused on how cooperation is enforced through costly punishment. Experiment 2 incorporates a retaliation mechanism into Experiment 1, thus testing for reactions to being punished unfairly. The findings of both experiments were generally consistent with the argument.

Mark","For three decades, behavioral economists and social psychologists studying experimental public good dilemmas have consistently observed that contributions to public goods decline over time. Game theorists have simultaneously made the normative argument that, in social dilemmas with fixed end-points, cooperative behavior is 'irrational.' This dissertation presents the results of three studies that challenge both the generality of the previous empirical findings and the presumed efficacy of the normative prescription by identifying a key condition under which cooperation can be sustained and effective. Using archival data, Study 1 documented a 'consistent contributor effect'-how a consistent cooperator influences others, resulting in higher contribution levels within their groups, and superior outcomes for consistent contributors across groups. Study 2 experimentally manipulated the presence of a consistent contributor (CC) and replicated the findings from Study 1, thereby strengthening causal inference. Study 3 tested the impact of consistent contributor characteristics on their efficacy in yielding the CC effect. Smart 'high status' CCs were found to have a marginally greater impact on others' choices than 'lower status' CCs did, but both high and low status CCs elicited the effect relative to control groups. Although both high and low status CCs elicited the effect, only high status CCs were given credit by their fellow group members for being influential. Taken together, the behavioral results and the results of supplementary questionnaire data suggest that the mechanisms driving the consistent contributor effect include the norm of reciprocity (experience of social obligation), the establishment and encouragement of cooperative social norms, and the material and psychological reduction of risk perceptions for CCs' fellow group members. Results have implications for how we think about what constitutes 'rational choice,' and how we implement and teach strategic analysis and action.

We clarify this dilemma by first classifying public goods dilemma properties that specify individual outcomes as individual properties (e.g., Marginal Per Capita Return) and group outcomes as group properties (e.g., public good multiplier), mathematically showing how only one set of properties can remain constant as the dilemma size increases. Underpinning decision-making regarding individual and group properties, we propose that individuals are motivated by both individual and group preferences based on a theory of collective rationality. We use Van Lange's integrated model of social value orientations to operationalize these preferences as an amalgamation of outcomes for self, outcomes for others, and equality of outcomes. Based on this model, we then predict how the public good's benefit and size, combined with controlling individual versus group properties, produce different levels of cooperation in public goods dilemmas. A two (low vs. high benefit) by three (2-person baseline vs. 5-person holding constant individual properties vs. 5-person holding constant group properties) factorial experiment (group n = 99; participant n = 390) confirms our hypotheses. The results indicate that when holding constant group properties, size decreases cooperation. Yet when holding constant individual properties, size increases cooperation when benefit is low and does not affect cooperation when benefit is high. Using agent-based simulations of individual and group preferences vis-à-vis the integrative model, we fit a weighted simulation model to the empirical data. This fitted model is sufficient to reproduce the empirical results, but only when both individual (self-interest) and group (other-interest and equality) preference are included. Our research contributes to understanding how people's motivations and behaviors within public goods dilemmas interact with the properties of the dilemma to lead to collective outcomes.

Theory predicts that public goods will be exploited by cheaters who benefit from the goods by not paying for them, thereby leading to the collapse of cooperation. This situation, described as the 'public goods dilemma' in game theory, makes the ubiquity of cooperation a major evolutionary puzzle. Despite this generalization, the demonstration of genetic background and fitness effects of the public goods dilemma has been limited to interactions between viruses and between cells, and thus its relevance at higher levels of organismal complexity is still largely unexplored. Here we provide experimental evidence for the public goods dilemma in a social insect, the ant Pristomyrmexpunctatus. In this species, all workers are involved in both asexual reproduction and cooperative tasks. Genetic cheaters infiltrate field colonies, reproducing more than the workers but shunning cooperative tasks. In laboratory experiments, cheaters outcompeted coexisting workers in both survival and reproduction, although a group composed only of cheaters failed to produce offspring. The operations of the public goods dilemma in P. punctatus showed a remarkable convergence with those in microbial societies, not only in fitness consequences but also in behavioral mechanisms. Our study reinforces the evolutionary impact of cheaters on diverse cooperative systems in the laboratory and in the field.

In particular, significance is lost for Extraversion and Neuroticism with contribution amount as the criterion, and with social responsibility as the criterion significance is lost for Extraversion, Agreeableness, self-transcendence, and openness to change. At no point does any model change from nonsignificant to significant when only the Descriptive conditions are considered. This pattern indirectly suggests the role of the Injunctive norms. Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, and conservation maintain significance regardless of condition when amount of contribution is considered. Those high in Extraversion and low in Agreeableness made contributions that varied by condition (Proself, Control, Prosocial). With both, they gave the least in the Proself conditions and the most in the Prosocial conditions. Women had a higher sense of social responsibility, overall, but there was no gender difference related to contribution behavior. Despite some previous findings, social responsibility did not correlate with contribution behavior. This study lends support for the use of social norms in soliciting donations for non-profit organizations, and caution in utilizing uncooperative social norms. A field study should be conducted in the future to increase external validity. Additionally, it seems likely that the norms will be more influential in a natural setting with a concrete situation. Additional findings are presented and further discussed.

Why does cooperation routinely occur without coercion? One answer is that we are playing a game called the Prisoner's Dilemma. The Prisoner's Dilemma game poses a paradox--the rational player will never choose to cooperate. Yet when people play the game they frequently do cooperate. This was explicitly demonstrated by Rapoport's Prisoner's Dilemma study. As part of his study, Rapoport developed a stochastic learning model to help explain the human behavior he observed in the Infinitely Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma (IRPD) game. That model has weaknesses, however, including its inability to autonomously adapt when the rules of the game change. This is unfortunate because an adaptive IRPD-game learning model would be of benefit to the study of cooperative behavior between autonomous agents such as people and organizations and in the design of intelligent software agents. Bock's collective learning systems (CLS) theory provides an adaptative alternative to Rapoport's stochastic learning model. In this dissertation, we develop the personality-moderated collective learning (PMCL) model, build computer programs to simulate PMCL agents playing the IRPD game, and conduct Monte Carlo experiments. PMCL agents playing the IRPD game, and conduct Monte Carlo experiments. PMCL agents have temperament and attitude as personality factors. Our study confirms that collective learning allows diversity, consistency with Rapoport's study, and adaptability in intelligent software agents playing the IRPD game. Additionally, the study shows that small differences in PMCL agent personality can generate significant differences in IRPD-game behavior. The dissertation ends with a discussion on the applicability of PMCL for modeling human personality. The importance of this study is that it presents a new way of modeling the problem of cooperation between autonomous agents. Significant contributions include: (1) extending Bock's CLS theory to the IRPD problem, (2) developing the PMCL model, a new formulation of stochastic learning that does not have the weaknesses of Rapoport's stochastic learning model, and (3) introducing the concepts, attitude and temperament, to CLS theory. Intelligent software agents can be constructed with PMCL-based mechanisms and can then be organized into systems of adaptably-cooperative intelligent software agents. Additionally, the effect of artificial personality on autonomous agent behavior can be computationally modeled and studied.

These vectors are symbolized theta and theta' respectively. The model predicts that a subject will choose prosocially if theta >theta', non-prosocially if theta <theta', and will be indifferent if theta = theta'. Experiment 1 was a conceptual replication of Camac (1986). Subjects were classified as Cooperative, Individualistic, or Competitive with decomposed games.

A 3 (theta) by 8 theta') mixed-design MANOVA revealed significant main and interactive effects for theta and theta'. Stepdown F tests confirmed the prediction that Cooperators and Individualists would be responsive to the linear component of theta' and Competitors would be unresponsive. This finding supports the notion that Social Orientation plays an important role in interdependent decision making, at least in the Prisoner's Dilemma payoff structure. In experiment 2 the model was extended by including three new classes of one-shot matrix games besides Prisoner's Dilemma: Convergence, Maximizing Difference, and Spite. Consistent with our predictions, the level of prosocial choice systematically increased from Convergence to Prisoner's Dilemma to Maximizing Difference and Spite. Importantly, results also showed that subjects' responsiveness to payoff variations within each class of matrix game was moderated by Social Orientation.

In Study 1, 284 U.S. college students rated the attractiveness of four hypothetical outcomes in a 2 x 2 commuters' matrix (self car/pt x others car/pt). PIDSs were classified into one of four categories, and were subsequently analyzed in terms of three underlying preference components: preference for self (car/pt), others (car/pt), and coordination (avoid/join others). Results revealed a strong relationship between individual and collective travel concerns and PIDS, and between PIDS and commuting intentions, with the underlying components explaining the largest amount of variance in commuting intentions. Study 2 (N = 164, U.S. college students) examined the influence of two travel concerns (time, convenience), and three dispositional measures (social value orientation, trust, and perceived environmental impact of cars) on the PIDS (i.e., the given and effective matrices, respectively). Results supported Van Vugt, Meertens, & Van Lange's (1995) hypothesis that travel time results in a PIDS similar to a Chicken Dilemma while convenience leads to a PIDS similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma. Also, when the perceived environmental impact of cars was low, prosocials exhibited a weaker overall preference for the car, relative to proselfs. Study 3 replicated Study 2 on a sample of 88 Dutch commuters. Results were generally consistent with those reported in Study 2.

In addition, the current research explored the link between trust and a person's reaction to a bogus message from his or her partner that was either highly directive, requesting cooperation throughout the mixed-motive interaction, or nondirective and ambiguous, leaving behavioral choices almost entirely up to the partner. Participants' beliefs about the extent of their partners' trust were also measured, along with relationship closeness and commitment. Interactions between trust and closeness, and perceived trust and closeness, were obtained in this study. Respondents who held somewhat positive but uncertain views of partner trustworthiness (those who were low in closeness, but moderate in trust) made a greater effort to directly and specifically influence partner mixed-motive choices than did other participants; low-close, moderate-trust individuals also showed the strongest reactions to bogus partner messages. Further interactions of trust and closeness with gender were also observed, as well as interactions between closeness and perceptions of partner trust. Implications of the results for understanding the interplay of trust and closeness as couples encounter a novel and trust-relevant situation are discussed. The importance of perceived partner trust in predicting the nature of couple interaction is also discussed.

The outgroup previous decision was manipulated by changing the decision rule while holding constant the number of cooperative outgroup members' choices. The results demonstrate that subjects' outgroup attitude inferences and expectation of outgroup cooperation display the correspondence bias. Subjects inferred that the typical member of a previously cooperative outgroup held more cooperative attitudes than the typical member of a previously defecting outgroup. Furthermore, outgroups with a previous history of cooperation were perceived as more likely to cooperate in the future than previously defecting outgroups.

Although the tenets of interpersonal theory have long been accepted as a theoretical framework guiding clinical interventions, empirical studies examining the complementarity hypothesis have yielded mixed results. Reviewers have suggested that basic research was necessary to identify the preferences and behaviors associated with the hostile and friendly interpersonal styles, as well as to evaluate the possible ways in which intervening variables, such as sex of interactants and situational preferences for competition versus cooperation, may influence the behavioral display of interpersonal styles. The present research was focused on evaluating 98 subjects (49 male and 49 female), from each of the four quadrants of the interpersonal circumplex, to determine the manner in which situational congruity and sex of interactants may act as intervening variables to influence the display of interpersonal styles and complementarity. Utilizing prisoner's dilemma game methodology, it was found that friendly style individuals more often preferred to interact in cooperative contexts than did hostile-style individuals, while hostile style individuals more often preferred to interact in competitive contexts than friendly-style individuals. These affiliative-style preferences are consistent with interpersonal theory and suggest that the assessment of friendly-style complementarity may be best conducted under cooperative conditions, while the assessment of hostile-style complementarity may be best conducted under competitive conditions. Results of the present investigation also showed that sex of subjects and sex of 'partners' tended to impact how much subjects reported liking their partners, with female cooperative partners being liked most.

It was proposed that projective test responses contain non-pathological material that may provide a measure of interpersonal relatedness. The standard clinical battery currently lacks such a measure. Fifty-eight subjects (28 men and 30 women) for the study from the New York Metropolitan area and New Jersey. The subjects ranged in age from eighteen to sixty years old. Subjects were asked to be available for two sessions, each estimated to last about two hours. In the first meeting they were given the Rorschach test, and a battery of self-report measures and demographic questionnaires. This battery included The Crowne-Marlowe Social Desirability Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960), the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Empathy) (Davis, 1983), the Self-Report Altruism Scale (Rushton, 1981), and the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Peplau & Perlman, 1982). The second session involved having all the subjects in a large lecture room at the same time.

Throughout both sessions, situational 'opportunities' to behave in a prosocial manner were part of the experimental design. Subjects were given one point for each positive behavior they displayed. Opportunities included helping the experimenter pick up her 'accidentally' dropped books; assisting with moving a chair; returning a postcard by mail after the study had been completed; and indicating a willingness to participate in future studies without pay.

In contract negotiations, disputants' interests ordinarily are fundamentally opposed. The structure of contract negotiation problems is determined by the joint distribution of negotiators' payoffs across all feasible settlements. Analyses demonstrate that the attractiveness of common settlements, such as those arrived at through issue-by-issue compromise or logrolling, and the solution preferred by various social welfare criteria, is largely dependent on problem structure. The outcome of negotiations also is influenced by negotiators' strategic appraisals of potential concessions during the negotiating process. Simulation analyses investigated several simple concessionary strategies. The individualistic strategy, which places no weight, either positive or negative, on the other negotiator's payoff performs well no matter what the structure of the problem or what the other's strategy. In certain problems, a self-interested negotiator can do slightly better by instrumentally placing either a positive or a negative weight on the other's payoff. The other's strategy has as much or more of an effect on a negotiator's payoff as the negotiator's own strategy. A Prisoner's Dilemma problem emerged in all investigated problem structures; pairs of negotiators who both used rules that place some positive weight on the other received higher joint payoffs than pairs who used the individualistic rule. Two critical aspects of negotiators' social environment are identified--the 'rules' that specify the others with whom a negotiator must interact and the mix of strategies used by the population.

network public goods game. In this game, each player's payoff depends
only on his own contribution and the contributions of his immediate
neighbors in a circle network. As in the standard public goods game, we
find substantial heterogeneity in behavior across subjects, including
both unconditional free-riding and full cooperation, as well as
conditional cooperation. We first examine the impact of different
information conditions on conditional cooperation. At the aggregate
level, we find that players who observe average payoff information about
others contribute significantly less than those who observe average
contribution information. We then investigate the extent to which
conditional cooperators facilitate the spread of cooperation and
free-riding behavior across the network. In groups with a single
free-rider type, we show that individual contributions decay faster for
players who are closer in the network to the free rider. On the other
hand, in groups with a single unconditional full contributor type,
players do not respond by converging to full cooperation. Instead, we
find that proximity to the unconditional full contributor seems only to
mitigate (or delay) the typical decline in contributions over time.
These contrasting effects are consistent with the widespread claim that
conditional cooperation is imperfect, or exhibits a self-serving bias.

free-rider problem in the private provision of public goods. This paper
focuses on the endogenous establishment of an average-oriented norm
which sanctions deviations from average public good contributions. In a
laboratory experiment, we analyse whether subjects are willing to
implement a punishment and reward scheme at their own expense by
applying the theory of non-governmental norm enforcement put forward by
Buchholz et al. (J Public Econ Theory 16(6):899-916, 2014). Based on
their theory, which omits a central authority but introduces an
endogenously determined enforcement mechanism, we implement a two-stage
public good game. In the first stage, subjects determine the strength of
the sanctioning mechanism on their own. In the second stage, they decide
on their personal contributions to the public good based on the
established mechanism. In line with comparable pool punishment
experiments, we find that subjects are apparently willing to contribute
funds in order to establish a norm enforcement mechanism. Groups
over-invest in the mechanism, but this over-investment decreases over
time. These investments seem to be driven by the subjects' previous
individual contributions and partly by a number of strategic
considerations, i.e. the previous average contribution made to the
public good lowers the investment in the sanctioning mechanism. In the
second stage of our experiment, higher norm enforcement parameters tend
to lead to higher public good contributions. The earnings with the
mechanism are on average higher than without.}",article,ISI:000403982200008,"{3, SI}",,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000403982200008},{EY4XY},{Environ. Resour. Econ.},{13},{0},{3},{92},"{Financial support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and

learning, which has allowed us to spread over the planet, construct
complex societies, and travel to the moon. It has been hypothesized that
social learning has played a pivotal role in making human societies
cooperative, by favouring cooperation even when it is not favoured by
genetical selection. However, this hypothesis lacks direct experimental
testing, and the opposite prediction has also been made, that social
learning disfavours cooperation. We experimentally tested how different
aspects of social learning affect the level of cooperation in
public-goods games. We found that: (i) social information never
increased cooperation and usually led to decreased cooperation; (ii)
cooperation was lowest when individuals could observe how successful
individuals behaved; and (iii) cooperation declined because individuals
preferred to copy successful individuals, who cooperated less, rather
than copy common behaviours. Overall, these results suggest that
individuals use social information to try and improve their own success,
and that this can lead to lower levels of cooperation.}",article,ISI:000400166400007,{1853},,{ROYAL SOC},,,{2020-11-05},"{Bronze, Green Published}",{ISI:000400166400007},{ET3GS},{Proc. R. Soc. B-Biol. Sci.},{34},{1},{7},{81},"{M.N.B.-C. and C.E.M.: John Fell Fund Oxford; M.N.B.-C. and S.A.W.:

cooperation (CC) behavior or its variant called moody conditional
cooperation (MCC), with which they basically tend to cooperate when many
other peers have previously cooperated. Recent computational studies
showed that CC and MCC behavioral patterns could be explained by
reinforcement learning. In the present study, we use a repeated
multiplayer prisoner's dilemma game and the repeated public goods game
played by human participants to examine whether MCC is observed across
different types of game and the possibility that reinforcement learning
explains observed behavior. We observed MCC behavior in both games, but
the MCC that we observed was different from that observed in the past
experiments. In the present study, whether or not a focal participant
cooperated previously affected the overall level of cooperation, instead
of changing the tendency of cooperation in response to cooperation of
other participants in the previous time step. We found that, across
different conditions, reinforcement learning models were approximately
as accurate as a MCC model in describing the experimental results.
Consistent with the previous computational studies, the present results
suggest that reinforcement learning may be a major proximate mechanism
governing MCC behavior.}",article,ISI:000391548500001,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-05},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000391548500001},{EH1SW},{Sci Rep},{18},{1},{11},{53},"{This research was supported by JST, ERATO, Kawarabayashi Large Graph

that public disclosure potentially drives pollution abatement and that

method for exploring the motivation of participants when contributing to
a public good in the role of ``leader{''} or ``follower{''}. In the
Hybrid Public Good experiment each of two interacting contributors
chooses an independent contribution level as well as three adjusted
contribution levels when (s)he, as the only adjusting player, learns
that the other's independent contribution is smaller, equal or larger
than the own one. To approximate the border cases of simultaneous
contributing as well as sequential contributions we systematically vary
the probability that one player can adjust, based on such qualitative
information, but maintain that no adaptation at all and adaptation by
only one occurs with positive probability. Adaptation is framed in two
ways, once by additively changing the own independent contribution and
once by stating new contribution levels. Surprisingly, the framing
effect becomes stronger with experience. Reacting to coinciding
independent contributions implies impressive conformity in contributing.
Reacting to higher, respectively lower independent contributions implies
average upward, and, more strongly, downward adaptation. (C) 2016

both institutional rewards and institutional punishment can curb
free-riding and that the punishment effect is stronger than the reward
effect. Self-regarding models that are based on Nash equilibrium (NE)
strategies or evolutionary game dynamics correctly predict which
incentives are best at promoting cooperation, but individuals do not
play these rational strategies overall. The goal of our study is to
investigate the dynamics of human decision making in the repeated PGG
with institutional incentives. We consider that an individual's
contribution is affected by four factors, which are self-interest, the
behavior of others, the reaction to rewards, and the reaction to
punishment. We find that people on average do not react to rewards and
punishment, and that self-interest and the behavior of others
sufficiently explain the dynamics of human behavior. Further analysis
suggests that institutional incentives promote cooperation by affecting
the self-regarding preference and that the other-regarding preference
seems to be independent of incentive schemes. Because individuals do not
change their behavioral patterns even if they were not rewarded or
punished, the mere potential to punish defectors and reward cooperators
can lead to considerable increases in the level of cooperation.}",article,ISI:000378730000001,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-05},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000378730000001},{DP8EF},{Sci Rep},{28},{1},{7},{63},"{This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China

cooperation and investigate whether the difference in contributions
between Partners and Strangers designs in linear public goods
experiments can be explained by differences in beliefs.
Design/methodology/approach - The author conducted linear public goods
experiments by using Partners and Strangers designs with belief
eliciting their group member's contributions.
Findings - The author shows that the difference in the magnitude of the
responsiveness of contribution to belief (i.e. the marginal contribution
to belief) creates different contribution levels in Partners and
Strangers designs.
Research limitations/implications - The presented results imply that
having a strategic motive increases contributions by increasing the
magnitude of the responsiveness of contribution to belief rather than by
raising belief level.
Originality/value - The main claim of this paper is that ``marginal
contribution to belief{''} rather than ``belief level{''} causes the
difference in contribution levels between Partners and Strangers. This
is the first proven evidence of a difference in belief between Partners

mechanisms of why knowledge about others' norm violations triggers its
spread: (1) actors lower their subjective beliefs about the probability
or severity of punishment or (2) they condition their compliance on
others' compliance. While earlier field studies could hardly disentangle
both effects, we use a laboratory experiment which eliminates any
punishment threat. Subjects (n=466) can throw a die and are paid
according to their reported number. Our design rules out any possibility
of personal identification so that subjects can lie about their thrown
number and claim inflated payoffs without risking detection. The
aggregate distribution of reported payoffs allows the estimation of the
extent to which the honesty norm is violated. We compare two treatment
conditions in which subjects are informed about lying behavior of others
with a control condition without information feedback. Observations from
a subsequent die throw reveal that knowledge about liars triggers the
spread of lying compared to the control condition. Results from a
follow-up experiment show that this effect is moderated by subjects'
beliefs about the prevalence of norm violations of others. Our results
demonstrate the contagiousness of norm violations, where actors imitate
norm violations of others under the exclusion of strategic motives.}",article,ISI:000359422500003,{3},,{SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000359422500003},{CO8MC},{Ration. Soc.},{20},{0},{27},{33},,,"{Diekmann, Andreas/0000-0002-7344-5591

cooperation, understanding the group size effect on cooperative behavior
is a topic of central importance. Yet, the nature of this effect remains
largely unknown, with lab experiments insisting that it is either
positive or negative or null, and field experiments suggesting that it
is instead curvilinear. Here we shed light on this apparent
contradiction by considering a novel class of public goods games
inspired to the realistic scenario in which the natural output limits of
the public good imply that the benefit of cooperation increases fast for
early contributions and then decelerates. We report on a large lab
experiment providing evidence that, in this case, group size has a
curvilinear effect on cooperation, according to which intermediate-size
groups cooperate more than smaller groups and more than larger groups.
In doing so, our findings help fill the gap between lab experiments and
field experiments and suggest concrete ways to promote large scale
cooperation among people.}",article,ISI:000358198200004,{7},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-05},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000358198200004},{CN1RQ},{PLoS One},{21},{0},{19},{72},"{V.C. is supported by the Dutch Research Organization (NWO) grant no.

this effect is moderated. In the case of individual feedback we find the
willingness to contribute to be higher the lower the variation in
others' contributions, but with pronounced heterogeneity in individuals'

guided by others' average contributions, more people follow the,bad

Provision has negative downstream externalities: contributions hurt

information if this is to their material benefit. Several recent models
depart from this assumption and posit that some people do not lie or at
least do not lie maximally. These models invoke many different
underlying motives including intrinsic lying costs, altruism, efficiency
concerns, or conditional cooperation. To provide an
empirically-validated microfoundation for these models, it is crucial to
understand the relevance of the different potential motives. We measure
the extent of lying costs among a representative sample of the German
population by calling them at home. In our setup, participants have a
clear monetary incentive to misreport, misreporting cannot be detected,
reputational concerns are negligible and altruism, efficiency concerns

aggregate reporting behavior is close to the expected truthful
distribution suggesting that lying costs are large and widespread.

alternated visits to the nest more than would be expected by chance,
speeding up their feeding rate after their partner had visited the

the difficulty of reaching consensus. However, when a decision is made
collectively, perverse sanctioning ( e. g. punishing high contributors)
by individual actors is ruled out. Therefore, collective sanctioning
decisions are likely to be in the interest of the whole group. We employ
a laboratory experiment where subjects play Public Goods Games with
opportunities for punishment or reward that is implemented either by an
individual, a majority, or unanimously. For both punishment and reward,
contribution levels are higher in the individual than the majority

Conservative estimates show that ethnic dominance between high and low

dominance interactions such as ethnic discrimination constitute a type
of antisocial punishment between groups. We also find that conditional

behave similarly, that is, behavior exhibits social interaction effects.
We conduct a laboratory experiment that avoids the identification
problem present in the field and allows us to study the behavioral logic
of social interaction effects. Our novel design feature is that each
subject is simultaneously a member of two randomly assigned and
identical groups where only members (neighbors) are different. We study
behavior in a coordination game with multiple equilibria and a public
goods game, which has only one equilibrium in material payoffs. We speak
of social interactions if the same subject at the same time makes
group-specific decisions that depend on their respective neighbors'
decisions. We find that a majority of subjects exhibit social
interaction effects both when the game has multiple equilibria in
material payoffs and when it only has one equilibrium. (JEL C91, H41,

results from a field experiment examining the role of seed money (i.e.,
no, 50\%, and 67\%) in combination with threshold size (i.e., low versus
high) in fundraising appeals across different targets (i.e., prospects,
low fidelity donors, and high fidelity donors). Based on a 2 x 3 x 3
between-subjects design we investigate charitable behavior of 25,617
households. Findings reveal a novel qualification of using seed
contributions as well as the necessity of a communication
differentiation by considering past behavior. We show that seed money
works well if the threshold is high but with a low threshold it could
have a baleful influence. More specifically, in campaigns targeted at
prospects and low fidelity donors, the announcement of seed money
increases donations regardless of the threshold level. However, in
campaigns targeted at high fidelity donors, seed money is an effective
strategy only when the threshold is rather high. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

of five months. We find that cooperation preferences are very stable at
the aggregate level, and, to a smaller degree, at the individual level,
allowing us to predict future behavior fairly accurately. Furthermore,
our results provide evidence on the psychological foundations of
cooperation preferences. The personality dimension `Agreeableness' is
closely related to both the type and the stability of cooperation
preferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000301315400024,{2},,{ELSEVIER},,,{2020-11-05},"{Green Published, Green Accepted}",{ISI:000301315400024},{905ZT},{J. Econ. Behav. Organ.},{42},{0},{52},{69},,,"{Thoni, Christian/0000-0003-1190-8471

the adaptive (ultimate) and mechanistic (proximate) explanations for the
evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Studies of cooperative
behaviour in humans invariably use economic games. These games have
provided important insights into the mechanisms that maintain economic
and social cooperation in our species. However, they usually rely on the
division of monetary tokens which are given to participants by the
investigator. The extent to which behaviour in such games may reflect
behaviour in the real world of biological markets - where money must be
earned and behavioural strategies incur real costs and benefits - is
unclear. To provide new data on the potential scale of this problem, we
investigated whether people behaved differently in two standard economic
games (public goods game and dictator game) when they had to earn their
monetary endowments through the completion of dull or physically
demanding tasks, as compared with simply being given the endowment. The
requirement for endowments to be `earned' through labour did not affect
behaviour in the dictator game. However, the requirement to complete a
dull task reduced cooperation in the public goods game among the subset
of participants who were not familiar with game theory. There has been
some effort to test whether the conclusions drawn from standard,
token-based cooperation games adequately reflect cooperative behaviour
`in the wild.' However, given the almost total reliance on such games to
study cooperation, more exploration of this issue would be welcome. Our
data are not unduly worrying, but they do suggest that further
exploration is needed if we are to make general inferences about human
behaviour from the results of structured economic games.}",article,ISI:000297555400072,{11},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-05},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000297555400072},{855HV},{PLoS One},{15},{0},{8},{67},"{This study was funded by an award from Oxford University Press's John

genetic predispositions. In this study, we investigated the relationship
between individuals' behavior in a public goods experiment and the

there is a significant association between individuals' behavior in a

carriers of the low activity alleles cooperate significantly less than
those carrying the high activity alleles given a situation where
subjects had to rely on their innate beliefs about others'

of cooperation, but to date there have been few experimental studies.
Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread
in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to
befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal
inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that
originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain
cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a
sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public
goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of
interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors
spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an
ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment,
focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution
behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a
party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists
for multiple periods and spreads upto three degrees of separation(from
person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each
additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first
period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects
who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a
consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior

hostility ({''}parochialism{''}), as well as of conditionally
cooperative strategies, in explaining contributions to experimental
public goods games. The experimental conditions vary group composition
along two culturally inheritable traits (political party preference and
religious affiliation) and one trivial, ``minimal{''} trait (birth
season). We contrast ingroup, outgroup, and random group conditions and
investigate the relation between the own contribution to the public good
and the expectations about other group members' behavior in each one of
them. We find evidence for ingroup favoritism but no support for a
separate tendency towards outgroup hostility. Further, conditional
cooperation and ingroup bias are, to some extent, linked. Subjects had
higher expectations of the contributions of ingroup members, and their
own behavior was more strongly conditioned on other group members'
expected behavior in the ingroup conditions. In ingroup contexts,
subjects displayed a form of ``strong reciprocity{''} by giving more
than they expected others to at high expectation levels but less at low
expectation levels. Once these interactions are taken into account, we
do not find a direct effect of ingroup bias anymore. We discuss these
results in the light of theories of cultural group selection and
conclude that too much emphasis may have been laid on direct intergroup
conflict. Our results suggest that differential cooperativeness, rather
than parochialism, may characterize the behavior of individuals in
cultural ingroups and outgroups. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

evolutionary puzzle. Despite its costly nature, cooperative behavior is
commonly found in all human societies-a fact that has interested
researchers from a wide range of disciplines, including biology,
economics, and psychology, to name a few. Many behavioral experiments
have demonstrated that cooperation within a group can be sustained when
free riders are punished. We argue that punishment has both a direct
effect and an indirect effect on promoting cooperation. The direct
effect of punishment alters the consequences of cooperation and
defection in such a way as to make a rational person prefer cooperation.
The indirect effect of punishment promotes cooperation among conditional
cooperators by providing the condition necessary for their cooperation
(i.e., the expectation that other members will also cooperate). Here we
present data from two one-shot n-person prisoner's dilemma games,
demonstrating that the indirect effect of punishment complements the
direct effect to increase cooperation in the game. Furthermore, we show
that direct and indirect effects are robust across two forms of
punishment technology: either when punishment is voluntarily provided by
game players themselves or when it is exogenously provided by the
experimenter. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000249287000004,{5},,{ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000249287000004},{207YM},{Evol. Hum.

border and then develop a truce, known as the dear-enemy phenomenon,

present evidence that among male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius

conditional cooperation that is stabilized, at least in part, by
retaliation against cheaters. Simulated intrusions by randomly chosen
neighbours were punished by a targeted increase in vigilance and
aggression that persists for days. We interpret this increase in
vigilance towards trespassers as a manifestation of distrust. The
conditional decrease in vigilance and aggression is tempered by each
neighbour's probability of cuckolding the focal male. Male red-winged
blackbirds maintained greater vigilance and aggression towards sexually
attractive neighbours that were more successful at extra-pair
fertilizations (EPFs). It is unlikely that males directly observed
neighbours copulating with their mates. They were more likely to assess
a neighbour's ability to achieve extra-pair copulations using surrogate
cues that correlate with success at EPFs, including body size. Our
results suggest that red-winged blackbirds use rules that incorporate
their neighbour's behaviour and quality in their territorial

and sanctions on cooperation in a voluntary contribution experiment. It
appears that both rewards and sanctions increase contributions (and that
rewards are more effective than sanctions) only when subjects interact
repeatedly within the same group. The effect is, however, insignificant,
which could be due to the higher variance in presence of rewards and
sanctions. Furthermore, it is evidenced that rewards have some negative
effect on the future contribution for both the imposer and the imposed
when the partner matching is applied, but both rewards and sanctions
have mainly positive effects under the stranger matching. Thus it seems
that the recipient of the feedback takes the message as a reliable
external evaluation of her contribution only under the stranger matching
protocol when the strategic use of feedback can largely be excluded.

The present authors argue that this is because there is no reason to expect that internals are more cooperative than externals, or vice versa. Going back to the definition of the locus of control concept, it was hypothesized that internals are likely to use both cooperative and competitive behavior strategically to further their own self-interest. To test this hypothesis, 39 university students (mean age 22.5 yrs) played 3 repeated prisoner's dilemma games. Their locus of control was measured with Rotter's Internal–External Locus of Control Scale (J. B. Rotter, 1966). Results suggest that internals have the adaptive capacity to instrumentally switch from cooperative to competitive behavior, and vice versa, in prisoner's dilemma games. They also behave more opportunistically when the risk of retaliation is low. The results also make clear that it is essential to study cooperative behavior dynamically.

Results indicate that internal locus of control, high self-monitoring, and high sensation seeking were systematically associated with cooperative behavior.

Conventional game theoretic analysis predicts greater cooperation in ongoing relationships than with occasional partners. This suggests that an option to exit decreases cooperation by reducing players' dependence on each other for help in the future. An alternative hypothesis is that cooperation increases with selectivity—that is, with the ability to play with a desired partner. This suggests that an exit option increases cooperation. Both hypotheses were tested in laboratory experiments with a total of 91 college students, using 'Trump,' a new card game representation of a Prisoner's Dilemma. In Exp 1, the exit option reduced dependence and increased selectivity, relative to a no-exit condition. It was found that selectivity and dependence both increased cooperation, but for different reasons and with different players, leaving overall cooperation rates unchanged by an option to exit. In Exp 2, the exit option increased selectivity but not dependence, relative to a forced-exit condition. Here higher cooperation was seen with an option to exit, but only for Ss playing defensive strategies.

Results show that when players were not allowed to communicate with one another, they gradually learned that it does not pay to participate, but when within-group communication was allowed, the overall effect was to increase individual participation. However, it was found that this effect varied greatly in later stages of the game. In some cases, intragroup communication eliminated individual participation and rewarded the members of both teams with the mutually cooperative outcome, but in other cases, it intensified the intergroup conflict to its maximal level of full participation.

In Exp 1, 10–14 college students participated in 2-player weak-link coordination games and PD games. The results showed that there is an effect of precedent: a history of efficient play in the 7-action weak-link game is correlated with an increase in efficient play in a subsequent PD game. 33 college students participated in Exp 2. The procedures were almost identical to Exp 1, except that players in a dyad or triad were told the choices by all Ss in their group, rather than simply the minimum choice.

Whereas most theorists have accounted for cooperation in terms of an ethically rooted concern for matching another's 'good faith' cooperation, others have argued that cooperation reflects several distinct social norms or heuristics. In the latter spirit, the current paper argues that whereas 1 source of cooperation is an effort to match cooperation of others, another source of cooperation is an illusory effort to exert control over others. To distinguish these social decision heuristics and investigate their boundary conditions, we test hypotheses about how their occurrence depends on the timing of decisions in a PD game in which the 2 players move on different days. Two experiments with 353 Ss consistently supported the hypothesis that the control heuristic is more frequent when Ss believe that their counterpart's move lies in the future rather than in the past. Support was also obtained for a second hypothesis that the matching heuristic, by contrast, is less frequent when Ss believe that the counterpart's move lies in the future rather than in the past.

The theory holds that a person's behavior (B) is a function of his behavior intention (BI) which is determined by his attitude toward the act (A-act) and by his beliefs about the expectations of the other player, i.e., social normative beliefs (NBs). 2 PD games differing in Cooperation Index (CI) were each played in a cooperative, a competitive, and an individualistic motivational orientation. 16 groups, 8 male and 8 female, were assigned to each of the 3 motivational conditions. CI and motivational orientations affected questionnaire measures of the theoretical constructs and game behavior as expected. Their influence on B was mediated by BI through A-act and NBs. BI correlated highly with B and was in turn accurately predicted from A-act and NBs in a multiple-regression equation. The relative importance of A-act and NBs in predicting BI and B varied as expected with the motivational orientation: in the cooperative condition… (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)",inbook,2000-12688-00920000101,,,Psychology Press,"0-86377-696-5, 0-86377-697-3",Motivational science: Social and personality perspectives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Key reading in social psychology,,,

African American males, in particular, are frequently the object of racial bias and fear responses (Dembo, 1988). This study was designed to explore several facets of crossracial interactions of young male African Americans and Caucasian Americans. Specific goals were to analyze how the presentation of information that another young male, from a different racial group, displaying either high or low levels of fear in interracial interactions and either high or low levels of prejudicial attitudes would affect rates of cooperative behavior in a mixed-motive game and social impression ratings of identified co-players. In addition, responses on a self-reported measure related to racial attitudes were utilized to regroup participants by theoretical stages of development, and then reanalyze game playing responses. Sixty-seven male African American and sixty-eight male Caucasian American middle school, secondary school and two-year college students (ages 11-20) living in suburban regions of New York State participated in the study. Each participant played four, twenty-five trial rounds of a mixed-motive prisoner's dilemma game with different race co-players identified as demonstrating either high or low levels of fear responses during interracial interactions, and racial prejudice. Participants played the game with identified co-players on a computer making choices according to a randomly generated sixty percent cooperative response rate. The study took the form of a 2 x 2 x 2 design, with race of participant (African American vs. Caucasian American), perception of fear in interracial interaction (high vs. low), and perception of racial bias (high vs. low) as factors. Rate of cooperative responses during each phase of the prisoner's dilemma game was measured as a dependent variable both within subjects and between racial groups. In addition a social impression rating of identified co-players was taken following each round of the game. The Racial Attitude Identity Scale (RIAS) or White Racial Attitude Identity Scale (WRIAS) (Helms, 1990), was analyzed as a non-manipulated independent variable by grouping participants into theoretical identity development stages. Demographic information (parent education, family income) and prior experience with cooperative learning strategies in school settings was also collected. It was hypothesized but not supported that: (1) male African Americans in the high fear-low prejudice condition would have the highest rates of cooperation and those in the low fear-high prejudice condition would cooperate the least across all groups; (2) Caucasian Americans in high fear-low prejudice condition would cooperate at lower rates than African Americans in the same experimental condition. Support was found for the following hypotheses: (1) Across racial groups, participants in low fear-low prejudice conditions rated co-players more positively on the social impression rating; (2) Among African American participants in immersion-emersion stage of racial identity development on the RIAS cooperated at lower levels than other stages; and (3) Caucasian Americans in the reintegration stage on the WRIAS cooperated less than other developmental stages.

An important mediator in the relationship between the early experience of abuse and later maladaptive social behavior is thought to be biased and deficient information processing patterns. However, the behavior and information processing of abused children have not been examined within the context of close friendships. The current study examined these variables while physically abused children and their close friends played the Prisoner's Dilemma, a game in which cooperation and trust are necessary to optimize outcome. Subjects were 16 children (10 boys and 6 girls) aged five to nine about whom 'clear and convincing' evidence for physical abuse was found, 19 nonabused children (6 boys and 13 girls) matched on sex, age socioeconomic status and ethnicity, and the abused children's closest same-sex friends. In order to elicit the children's information processing about the game, a videotape of the children's interaction was replayed to each child. Abused children were more competitive during the game (F (1,59) = 4.62, p <), had more goals indicative of fear prior to the game (F (1,59) = 4.10, p <), and when their friends competed, were significantly more likely to show a hostile attributional bias on forced choice questions (F (1,31) = 4.50, p <) compared to nonabused children. In relation to their own behavior in the game, abused children tended to think that their friend was sad or mad (F (1,32) = 8.12, p <), and disliked them (F (1,32) = 8.12, p <). Information processing patterns were important correlates of abused children's behavior during the game, with fearful pregame goals (r = -, p <) and children's negative evaluations of their own behavior (r = -, p <) associating with competition during the game. The results of this study suggest that, for young abused children, improving cooperation skills and information processing within their close friendships may be an important adjunct to social skills training within the peer group.

Exp 1 manipulated whether 134 graduate business students stood face-to-face or side-by-side (unable to see each other) in a simulated strike negotiation. Face-to-face dyads were more likely to coordinate on a settlement early in the strike, resulting in higher joint gains. Exp 2 manipulated whether previously unacquainted negotiators (half of the students were graduate business students and the other half were undergraduates) conversed face-to-face or by telephone before separating to play a conflict game with the structure of a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Face-to-face dyads were more likely to coordinate on high joint gain outcomes. The facilitatory effect of face-to-face contact was statistically mediated by a measure of dyadic rapport. Results did not support alternative interpretations based on individual-level positive affect or expectations about opponents.

If the opponent seems to follow a competitive or exploitative strategy groups will behave more competitively than individuals (e.g., J. M. Rabbie et al., 1982). In other PDG research it is found that groups are almost invariably more competitive or less cooperative than individuals (e.g., J. Schopler and C. A. Insko, 1992). Our conjecture is that this individual–group discontinuity effect may be partly attributed to unique features of the experimental procedures of Schopler and Insko which induce mutual (reciprocal) cooperation between individuals and mutual competition between groups.

Our recent research indicates that individuals expect others' behavior to be influenced more by financial incentives than it actually is (Miller & Ratner, 1998). This dissertation examines whether a self-interest norm makes people feel that their own decisions should be guided by material outcomes. If self-interested behavior is indeed a norm, then we would expect people to engage in more self-interested behavior in public and when giving input to a group decision. The results of the present research provide evidence that a norm of self-interest influences the decisions people make. The results of Study 1 suggest that group members make self-interested decisions because they expect this is what other group members want. Study 2 incorporates a public/private manipulation and an individual difference measure of sensitivity to social norms to examine whether a norm of self-interest contributes to the tendency for groups to compete in prisoner's dilemma games. Consistent with predictions, the results of Study 2 indicate that participants expect their peers to want to compete, that it is the individuals high in fear of negative evaluation who give more competitive responses in the group-decision condition, and that participants' responses are more closely aligned to the responses they expect others to give in the group-decision condition. Study 3 extends the present analysis to the domain of procedural and distributive justice to examine whether people feel uncomfortable indicating that they care about fairness of procedures rather than simply the bottom-line material outcomes of those procedures. Consistent with predictions, Study 3 provides preliminary evidence that participants perceive a norm to maximize material outcomes rather than procedural fairness. This evidence for a self-interest norm has important implications for the literature on self-interest and individual and group decision making.

Exploratory factor analyses generally supported a four factor structure rather than the five factor structure that Rahim proposes. Correlations between conflict subscales and personality variables provided mixed support, with only 16 of the 33 hypothesized correlations being statistically significant. Results from analyzing the impact of role status on conflict behavior supported all predictions. Criterion-related validity was examined by correlating conflict style scores with conflict behavior in a prisoner's dilemma game for 50 of the participants. It was expected that the integrating conflict style would correlate with cooperative behavior and the dominating conflict style would correlate with competitive behavior. However, these correlations were nonsignificant. The validity of using the ROCI-II with nonorganizational populations is discussed, as is the conclusion that situational factors (e.g., the power dynamic between conflicting parties) appears to be more important in predicting use of conflict strategies than are personality variables.

In the context of social networks, this idea implies that cooperation should fare better in highly clustered networks such as cliques than in networks with low clustering such as random networks. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of web-based experiments, in which 24 individuals played a local public goods game arranged on one of five network topologies that varied between disconnected cliques and a random regular graph. In contrast with previous theoretical work, we found that network topology had no significant effect on average contributions. This result implies either that individuals are not conditional cooperators, or else that cooperation does not benefit from positive reinforcement between connected neighbors. We then tested both of these possibilities in two subsequent series of experiments in which artificial seed players were introduced, making either full or zero contributions. First, we found that although players did generally behave like conditional cooperators, they were as likely to decrease their contributions in response to low contributing neighbors as they were to increase their contributions in response to high contributing neighbors. Second, we found that positive effects of cooperation were contagious only to direct neighbors in the network.

It merges psychology and sociology with economics to develop a behavioral model in the context of an environmental issue. The model supposes that individuals have preference over their image of themselves as environmentally responsible people. This image is partially determined by norms they hold about how much to contribute to the public good. These norms, in turn, are influenced by policy-makers, for example through a mechanism such as environmental campaigns. The first chapter lays out the conceptualization of norms used in the subsequent chapters. The main points are that I distinguish between statistical norms, what 'is' done, and injunctive norms, what 'should' be done. Injunctive norms are sanctioned either by oneself, others, or both. This simple typology is contrasted with existing conceptualizations of norms in the literature. The second chapter is an empirical analysis which makes some conclusions about how norms affect self-sanctioning through a change in self-image. Survey data regarding hypothetical contributions to a carbon offsetting program show that (1) the higher is one's contribution, the higher is his self-image, and that (2) the higher is one's injunctive norm of how much he thinks one should contribute, the lower is his self-image. This indicates that, depending upon the context, the norm itself should enter individuals' utility functions. It is also shown that self-image itself increases after a contribution has been made, as opposed to individuals making a contribution that is consistent with a given self-image. Chapter 3 combines everything together into a theoretical model in which policy-makers can allocate a given amount of tax revenue between direct provision of a public good and influencing norms to try to increase private provision. An analytical analysis of efficiency and a simulation analysis of welfare effects are conducted. Depending upon individual preferences over private good consumption, public good consumption, and image, a positive investment in norm manipulation can increase social welfare.

It has been argued that this is because individuals gain satisfaction from the success of others, and that such prosocial preferences require a novel evolutionary explanation. However, in previous games, imperfect behavior would automatically lead to an increase in cooperation, making it impossible to decouple any form of mistake or error from prosocial cooperative decisions. Here we empirically test between these alternatives by decoupling imperfect behavior from prosocial preferences in modified versions of the public goods game, in which individuals would maximize their selfish gain by completely (100%) cooperating. We found that, although this led to higher levels of cooperation, it did not lead to full cooperation, and individuals still perceived their group mates as competitors. This is inconsistent with either selfish or prosocial preferences, suggesting that the most parsimonious explanation is imperfect behavior triggered by psychological drives that can prevent both complete defection and complete cooperation. More generally, our results illustrate the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the evolutionary implications of economic experiments, especially the absolute level of cooperation in a particular treatment.

From this qualitative analysis, the dissertation develops a general theory and tests it, using original data on ethno-income and ethno-geographic cross-cuttingness, on health outcomes and spending categories in 43 developing democracies. The dissertation finds that ethnic diversity does not necessarily lead to under-provision of public goods. Appropriately designed electoral rules can lead to the creation of broad, national coalitions that allocate resources to the nation at large rather than to the ethnic group(s) of the government. Second, no single type of electoral rule is necessarily harmful to public goods provision; rather, depending on the type of society in which they operate, PR and majoritarianism can be beneficial or detrimental.

We examined cooperation behaviors of 22 gifted and 26 average adolescents during an iterative binary public goods (PG) game, a multi-player social interaction game, and analyzed strategic decision processes that include cooperation and free-riding. We found that the gifted adolescents were more cooperative than average adolescents. Particularly, comparing the strategies for the PG game between the two groups, gifted adolescents were less sensitive to loss, yet were more sensitive to gain. Additionally, the behavioral characteristics of average adolescents, such as low trust of the group and herding behavior, were not found in gifted adolescents. These results imply that gifted adolescents have a high cognitive ability but a low ability to process affective information or to adapt in social groups compared with average adolescents.

Comparing two protocols for sharing the prize—egalitarian and proportional profit-sharing rules—we find that (i) free-riding diminishes and (ii) team members contribute more toward their team's effort when they belong to the larger team and when the profit-sharing rule is proportional.

A subject’s compliance with first-order stochastic dominance as well as, possibly, patience, gender, and altruism have some systematic effects on her behavior in repeated games. At the level of a pair of subjects who are playing a repeated game, each subject’s gender as well as, possibly, patience and ability to choose an available dominant strategy in a one-shot matrix game systematically affect the frequency of the cooperate–cooperate outcome. However, overall, the number of systematic relationships is surprisingly small.

We recorded the eye movements in 2 × 2 symmetric games including dominance‐solvable games like prisoner's dilemma and asymmetric coordination games like stag hunt and hawk–dove. The evidence was most consistent with the accumulation of payoff differences over time: we found longer duration choices with more fixations when payoffs differences were more finely balanced, an emerging bias to gaze more at the payoffs for the action ultimately chosen, and that a simple count of transitions between payoffs—whether or not the comparison is strategically informative—was strongly associated with the final choice.

most participants have been male, while previous research in our lab

by significantly increasing the number of participants to enable the use
of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit more precise
localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to
receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo.
Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Sex differences were
observed for effects of OT on the neural response to reciprocated
cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen response among
males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT
may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions
among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women.
Similar sex differences were also observed for AVP effects within
bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus when a more liberal
statistical threshold was employed. While our findings support previous
suggestions that exogenous nonapeptides may be effective treatments for

are sensitive to the context they are presented in. However, the
strength of such `framing effects' varies between studies, and some
studies fail to find any effect at all. A long line of research has
argued that the presence and size of framing effects depend to a large
extent on whether people use higher or lower-level mental decision
making processes (or heuristics). A similarly important line of research
in social psychology and economics suggests that higher-level mental
processes such as self-control draw upon a limited pool of mental
resources that can be exhausted. This study links these two lines of
research and investigates whether depleting people's mental resources
(or `willpower') affects the degree to which they are susceptible to
framing effects. In three separate experiments we depleted participants'
willpower using the commonly used Stroop task method, and subsequently
made them take part in a series of tasks, including a framed prisoner's
dilemma, an attraction effect task and an anchoring effect task.
However, though we find strong evidence of a framing effect in all three
tasks, the strength of these effects is not affected by induced changes
in the level of willpower depletion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Sharp, Carla and Clark, Shane K. and Cropsey, Karen L.","{BackgroundThe high rate of incarceration in the USA warrants continued
exploration into understanding and ameliorating criminal behaviour. The
growing use of cooperative games to measure developing prosocial
behaviours has never been explored in a US criminal justice population.
AimsThe aim of this study is to examine cooperative game play among
offenders under supervision in the community. We hypothesised that the
offenders would use more guarded and self-preserving strategies and be
more likely to excel in short-lived interactions than law-abiding
community citizens.
MethodsCommunity supervised offenders (83) and general population
comparison participants (41) were recruited by town centre adverts
placed in popular shops. Using the supervision centres as venues, all
participants were asked to complete four cooperative games (prisoner's
dilemma, public goods game, ultimatum game and trust game), not knowing
the identity of the other player who was always, in fact, the
experimenter.
ResultsThe offender and general population groups were similar in age
(early 30s), sex (2/3 men), race (45\% white) and IQ distribution (low
average range). Offenders made lower offers in the ultimatum game, had
lower scores in the prisoner's dilemma, made lower investments and
offered lower returns in the trust game and contributed less in the
public goods game.
ConclusionsEven community-based offenders thus seem to have deficits in
the kinds of gameplay, which are informed by theories of social
cooperation, but the direction of relationship with offending remains
unclear. The apparent deficits may reflect adaptation to a hostile
environment where trust and reciprocity are not rewarded. It is also
important to recognise that these community-based offenders did develop
play indicative of trust and reciprocity, they just did so more slowly
than the comparison group. This may have implications for allowing time
for rapport to develop in supervisory relationships. Finally, offenders
may benefit from learning that although more guarded behaviours may be
adaptive in a rough neighbourhood or in jail, they may be maladaptive
and limit their success in other settings such as the work place.

the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex and with the
neural response to positive social interactions in the insula,
indicating that Neuroticism modulates neuropsychological processing of
both negative and positive social interactions. Neuroticism did not
modulate the effect of intranasal OT treatment on the neural response to
either positive or negative social interactions. On the other hand, AVP
treatment significantly interacted with Neuroticism to modulate the BOLD
response to both positive and negative social interactions.
Specifically, AVP increased anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal
cortex and lateral temporal lobe responses to negative social
interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring high rather
than low on Neuroticism. AVP also increased the insula response to
positive social interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring
high rather than low on Neuroticism. These results imply that AVP may
increase emotion regulation in response to negative social interactions
and the salience of positive social interactions to a greater extent in
individuals high compared to low in Neuroticism. The current findings
urge caution against uniform clinical application of nonapeptides and
suggest that their efficacy may vary as a function of personality. (C)

purpose of the present experiment was to study altruistic behavior by
players (P) in 2-person iterated prisoner's dilemma games in which
reciprocation by the other player (OP) was impossible, and this
impossibility was clear to P. Altruism by P could not therefore be
attributed to expectation of reciprocation. The cost to P of altruistic
behavior was constant throughout the study, but the benefit to OP from
P's cooperation differed between groups and conditions. Rate of
cooperation was higher when benefit to OP was higher. Thus altruism (not
attributable to expectation of reciprocation) can be a significant
factor in interpersonal relationships as studied in iterated prisoner's
dilemma games, and needs to be taken into account in their analysis. (C)

explain why cooperative video game play can increase players' subsequent
pro-social behaviors. Participants played a basketball video game with a
helpful or unhelpful teammate against an ostensible opposing team.
Participants in the control condition did not play a video game with
their teammate. Participants then engaged in a one-shot simultaneous or
sequential prisoner's dilemma game with their teammate and an opposing
team member. In line with Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, donations to
teammates were influenced by expectations of others to reciprocate
pro-social behaviors. Specifically, playing with a helpful teammate
confirmed expectations of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social
behaviors and led to increases in pro-social behaviors between
teammates. Playing with an unhelpful teammate disconfirmed expectations
of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social behaviors and led to
decreases in pro-social behaviors between teammates. Interestingly,
playing with a helpful teammate increased participants' donation to
out-group members even though participants did not expect them to
reciprocate. The current study emphasizes the importance of pro-social
reciprocity expectations in predicting people's pro-social behaviors and
the impact cooperative video game play can have on such expectations.

(BD) have overlapping clinical presentations and symptoms - sources of
persistent clinical confusion. Game-theory can characterize how social
function might be sub-optimal in the two disorders and move the field
beyond the anecdotal description of clinical history. Here, we tested
the hypothesis that BPD and BD can be distinguished on the basis of
diminished reciprocal altruism in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (PD)
games.
Method. Twenty females with BPD, 20 females with euthymic BD and 20
healthy (non-clinical) females, matched for age and cognitive ability,
were assessed for Axis-I and personality disorders, and completed
psychometric measures of state affect, impulsivity and hostility.
Participants completed two iterated PD games and a test of gaze-cueing.
Results. In the PD games, BPD participants failed to show statistically
stable preferences to cooperate with social partners (playing
tit-for-tat) and made significantly fewer cooperative responses compared
to BD or controls (ANOVA main effect p = 0.03, post-hoc Tukey p < 0.05
for both comparisons). BPD participants were also less likely to sustain
cooperation following experiences involving mutual cooperation than the
other groups. Neither BPD nor BD participants demonstrated impairments
in shifting visual attention on the basis of other peoples' gaze.
Conclusions. These data indicate that BPD is (selectively) associated
with difficulties in establishing, and then maintaining, reciprocal
cooperation, involving altruism. These difficulties are not seen in
euthymic BD. Our data support the differentiation of BPD from BD and
offer fresh insights into the social difficulties experienced by
individuals with diagnoses of BPD.}",article,ISI:000354035000003,{8},,{CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000354035000003},{CH4WW},{Psychol. Med.},{19},{1},{15},{43},"{This study was funded by the Oxfordshire Health Services Research

along with a tendency to ignore, derogate, and harm rivaling out-groups.
Building off recent work suggesting that decisions to cooperate can be
relatively fast and intuitive, we examine parochial altruism in
intergroup conflict when cognitive deliberation is rendered difficult or
not. Predictions were tested in an experiment using an incentivized
Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma Maximizing Differences Game with 95
subjects classified as either pro-social or pro-self being randomly
allocated to high vs. low impulse-control conditions. Results showed,
first of all, that self-sacrificial decisions to contribute were made
faster than decisions not to contribute, and that faster decision time
associated with more positive expectations of in-group members. Second,
we observed that lowering impulse control with a difficult rather than
easy Stroop Task increased the amount contributed to a pool that
benefited in-group members while harming out-group members; thus
reducing deliberation increased parochial altruism. Finally, results
replicated earlier work showing that especially pro-social (vs.
pro-self) individuals contributed more to the in-group and did not lower
their contributions to the between-group pool that benefitted their
ingroup and, simultaneously, hurt the out-group. This pattern emerged
independent of their impulse control. Thus, (in-group bounded)
cooperation is more prominent among individuals with strong rather than
weak other-regarding preferences. Moreover, the intuitive tendency to
cooperate may have evolved in the context of intergroup conflict and
therefore is sharp-edged in-group bounded and including willingness to
aggress out-groups.}",article,ISI:000355338900001,,,{FRONTIERS MEDIA SA},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000355338900001},{CJ2UA},{Front.

Thirty one individuals with documented neuroradiological abnormalities

takes the structure of that of either a prisoner's dilemma or a
snowdrift game. Then we analyze the evolution of cooperation in a
well-mixed population of agents, each of whom is associated with such a

population to update her strategy based on the myopic best-response

being betrayed in a portion of agents does not necessarily increase the
level of cooperation in the population. However, this resistance of the
population against low-betrayal-level agents is effective only up to
some extend that is explicitly determined by the payoff matrices and the
number of agents associated with these matrices. Two other models are
also considered where the betrayal factor of an agent fluctuates as a
function of the number of cooperators and defectors that she encounters.

altruism in repeated social dilemmas. Specifically, we test whether
ingroup favoritism is a fixed phenomenon that can be observed from the
very beginning and remains stable over time, or whether it develops
(increases vs. decreases) during repeated contact. lngroup favoritism is
assessed through cooperation behavior in a repeated continuous
prisoner's dilemma where participants sequentially interact with 10
members of the ingroup (own city and university) and subsequently with
10 members of the outgroup (other city and university), or vice versa.
In none of the experiments do we observe initial differences in
cooperation behavior for interaction partners from the ingroup, as
compared to outgroup, and we only observe small differences in
expectations regarding the interaction partners' cooperation behavior.
After repeated interaction, however, including a change of groups, clear
ingroup favoritism can be observed. Instead of being due to gradual and
potentially biased updating of expectations, we found that these
emerging differences were mainly driven by the change of interaction
partners' group membership that occurred after round 10. This indicates
that in social dilemma settings ingroup favoritism is to some degree
dynamic in that it is enhanced and sometimes only observable if group
membership is activated by thinking about both the interaction with the
ingroup and the outgroup.}",article,ISI:000354536600002,,,{FRONTIERS MEDIA SA},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000354536600002},{CI1WU},{Front. Psychol.},{25},{0},{7},{49},,,"{Glockner, Andreas/0000-0002-7766-4791

the moderate fairness hypothesis weighs the opponent's outcomes less

increasingly and nonlinearly weighs the opponent's outcomes over time;

player gives to the opponent's outcomes, according to the gap between
the expected and the actual outcomes in each interaction. When players
lack explicit feedback about their opponent's choices and outcomes,
results are consistent with the selfish hypothesis; however, when this

findings are sensitive to these assumptions and that small changes to
the assumed geography of reproduction significantly affect the

guiding human altruistic decisions. These emotions are elevated in major
depressive disorder (MDD), such that MDD has been associated with
guilt-driven pathological hyper-altruism. However, the impact of such
emotional impairments in MDD on different types of social
decision-making is unknown.
Method. In order to address this issue, we investigated different kinds
of altruistic behaviour (interpersonal cooperation and fund allocation,
altruistic punishment and charitable donation) in 33 healthy subjects,
35 patients in full remission (unmedicated) and 24 currently depressed
patients (11 on medication) using behavioural-economical paradigms.
Results. We show a significant main effect of clinical status on
altruistic decisions (p = 0.04) and a significant interaction between
clinical status and type of altruistic decisions (p = 0.03). More
specifically, symptomatic patients defected significantly more in the
Prisoner's Dilemma game (p < 0.05) and made significantly lower
charitable donations, whether or not these incurred a personal cost (p <
0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Currently depressed patients also
reported significantly higher guilt elicited by receiving unfair
financial offers in the Ultimatum Game (p < 0.05).
Conclusions. Currently depressed individuals were less altruistic in
both a charitable donation and an interpersonal cooperation task. Taken
together, our results challenge the guilt-driven pathological
hyper-altruism hypothesis in depression. There were also differences in
both current and remitted patients in the relationship between
altruistic behaviour and pathological self-blaming, suggesting an
important role for these emotions in moral and social decision- making
abnormalities in depression.}",article,ISI:000351462600017,{6},,{CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000351462600017},{CE0AA},{Psychol. Med.},{38},{3},{21},{53},"{This study was funded by Medical Research Council, UK (grant no.

resources, climate protection, security of energy supply, and workplace
collaborations are all examples of social dilemmas. Since cooperative
behaviour in a social dilemma is individually costly, Nash equilibrium
predicts that humans should not cooperate. Yet experimental studies show
that people do cooperate even in anonymous one-shot interactions. In
spite of the large number of participants in many modern social
dilemmas, little is known about the effect of group size on cooperation.
Does larger group size favour or prevent cooperation? We address this
problem both experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, we find
that there is no general answer: it depends on the strategic situation.
Specifically, we find that larger groups are more cooperative in the
Public Goods game, but less cooperative in the N-person Prisoner's
dilemma. Theoretically, we show that this behaviour is not consistent
with either the Fehr \& Schmidt model or (a one-parameter version of)
the Charness \& Rabin model, but it is consistent with the cooperative
equilibrium model introduced by the second author.}",article,ISI:000348105100003,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000348105100003},{AZ3CJ},{Sci Rep},{71},{2},{39},{62},,,,,{V.Capraro@cwi.nl},{Multidisciplinary Sciences},{Science \& Technology - Other Topics},"{PRISONERS-DILEMMA; COLLECTIVE ACTION; EVOLUTION; COMMONS; PREFERENCES;

a major focus of theoretical work in recent years. When players are
embedded in fixed networks, cooperators are more likely to interact
with, and benefit from, other cooperators. In theory, this clustering
can foster cooperation on fixed networks under certain circumstances.
Laboratory experiments with humans, however, have thus far found no
evidence that fixed network structure actually promotes cooperation.
Here, we provide such evidence and help to explain why others failed to
find it. First, we show that static networks can lead to a stable high
level of cooperation, outperforming well-mixed populations. We then
systematically vary the benefit that cooperating provides to one's
neighbors relative to the cost required to cooperate (b/c), as well as
the average number of neighbors in the network (k). When b/c > k, we
observe high and stable levels of cooperation. Conversely, when b/c <= k
or players are randomly shuffled, cooperation decays. Our results are
consistent with a quantitative evolutionary game theoretic prediction

to our knowledge, provide an experimental demonstration of the power of
static network structure for stabilizing human cooperation.}",article,ISI:000345920800037,{48},,{NATL ACAD SCIENCES},,,{2020-11-04},"{Bronze, Green Published}",{ISI:000345920800037},{AU9NN},{Proc.

cooperative behaviors. This study investigated the relationship between
social and non-social deficits in children with HFA and the cooperative
behaviors of such children. Theory of mind (ToM), executive function,
and central coherence of children with HFA and typically developing (TD)
children, aged 6-12 years, were investigated, and the effects of these
social and non-social deficits on children's cooperativeness were
examined. The classical prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) and cooperative
implemental tasks were used to assess children's cooperativeness. ToM
was measured using a series of classical false belief tasks and the face
test. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and the Embedded Figures
Test (EFT) were administered to assess executive function and central
coherence, respectively. The results showed that there was no
significant difference in cooperation in PDG between HFA and TD
children, while cooperation in children with HFA in the interruption
period of the implemental tasks was significantly lower than that of TD
children. Children with HFA had social deficits and had more poorly
developed ToM than TD children, and executive function in children with
HFA was poorer than that in TD children. Different types of deficits
were predictive of HFA children's degree of cooperation on different
tasks: the social perceptual component of ToM and executive function
predicted children's cooperativeness in the PDC, and executive function
predicted HFA children's cooperativeness during the interruption period
of an implemental task. By contrast, central coherence did not predict
either of the two types of cooperation. It might indicate that the two
different types of cooperative tasks may require different mental
abilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000345186700005,{12},,{ELSEVIER SCI LTD},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000345186700005},{AT8MG},{Res. Autism Spectr. Disord.},{51},{1},{6},{89},,,,,{zhulq@psych.ac.cn},"{Education, Special; Psychology, Developmental; Psychiatry;

to cooperate in social dilemmas, whereas defection requires effortful
deliberation. From this assumption, we derive that defection should
entail more cognitive conflict than cooperation. To test this
hypothesis, the current study presents a first application of the
response dynamics paradigm (i.e., mouse-tracking) to social dilemmas. In
a fully incentivized lab experiment, mouse movements were tracked while
participants played simple two-person social dilemma games with two
options (cooperation and defection). Building on previous research,
curvature of mouse movements was taken as an indicator of cognitive
conflict. In line with the hypothesis of less cognitive conflict in
cooperation, response trajectories were more curved (towards the
non-chosen option) when individuals defected than when they cooperated.
In other words, the cooperative option exerted more ``pull{''} on mouse
movements in case of defection than the non-cooperative option
(defection) did in case of cooperation. This effect was robust across
different types of social dilemmas and occurred even in the prisoner's
dilemma, where defection was predominant on the choice level.
Additionally, the effect was stronger for dispositional cooperators as
measured by the Honesty-Humility factor of the HEXACO personality model.
As such, variation in the effect across individuals could be accounted
for through cooperativeness.}",article,ISI:000345744700002,{6},,{SOC JUDGMENT \& DECISION MAKING},,,{2020-11-04},{DOAJ Gold},{ISI:000345744700002},{AU6XL},{Judgm. Decis.

b/c values investigated. Increasing b/c decreases the fraction of
participants engaging in zero cooperation and increases the fraction
engaging in maximal cooperation, suggesting a role for efficiency
concerns. However, a substantial fraction of participants consistently
engage in 50\% cooperation regardless of b/c. The presence of these
persistent 50\% cooperators is surprising, and not easily explained by
standard models of social preferences. We present evidence that this
behaviour is a result of social preferences guided by simple decision
heuristics, rather than the rational examination of payoffs assumed by
most social preference models. We also find a strong correlation between
play in the Prisoner's Dilemma and in a subsequent Dictator Game,
confirming previous findings suggesting a common prosocial motivation
underlying altruism and cooperation.}",article,ISI:000343980000001,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000343980000001},{AS0PN},{Sci Rep},{41},{0},{67},{66},"{We would like to thank Zivvy Epstein and Grant Koplin for assistance

theoretical work demonstrates that certain network structures favour the

that static networks do not enhance cooperative behaviour in humans. By
contrast, dynamic networks do foster cooperation. However, costs
associated with dynamism such as time or resource investments in finding
and establishing new partnerships have been neglected so far. Here, we
show that human participants are much less likely to break links when
costs arise for building new links. Especially, when costs were high,
the network was nearly static. Surprisingly, cooperation levels in
Prisoner's Dilemma games were not affected by reduced dynamism in social
networks. We conclude that the mere potential to quit collaborations is
sufficient in humans to reach high levels of cooperative behaviour.
Effects of self-structuring processes or assortment on the network
played a minor role: participants simply adjusted their cooperative

outcomes from the outset and throughout the game. With higher levels of
interdependence information, we found increased individual cooperation

regularly observe cooperative behaviour in everyday life and in
controlled experiments with anonymous people, even though standard
economic models predict that they should deviate from the collective
interest and act so as to maximise their own individual payoff. However,
there is typically heterogeneity across subjects: some may cooperate,
while others may not. Since individual factors promoting cooperation
could be used by institutions to indirectly prime cooperation, this
heterogeneity raises the important question of who these cooperators
are. We have conducted a series of experiments to study whether
benevolence, defined as a unilateral act of paying a cost to increase
the welfare of someone else beyond one's own, is related to cooperation
in a subsequent one-shot anonymous Prisoner's dilemma. Contrary to the
predictions of the widely used inequity aversion models, we find that
benevolence does exist and a large majority of people behave this way.
We also find benevolence to be correlated with cooperative behaviour.
Finally, we show a causal link between benevolence and cooperation:
priming people to think positively about benevolent behaviour makes them
significantly more cooperative than priming them to think malevolently.
Thus benevolent people exist and cooperate more.}",article,ISI:000342687200002,{8},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted}",{ISI:000342687200002},{AQ3JB},{PLoS One},{28},{0},{35},{58},"{The author CS has been supported by the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical

probability on the evolution of cooperation in the standard and modified
versions of an agent-based model of tag-mediated altruism. In our
evolutionary model, computational agents populate a large complex
network, engage into multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma-like interactions,
and reproduce sexually. Agents carry discernible phenotypic traits
subject to mutation, memorize their own experiences, and employ
different strategies when interacting with different types of
co-players. Choices made are selected from a pool of two conditional and
two unconditional strategies, depending on the available memory contents
and phenotypic similarity among interactors. For the dominating strategy
in our standard model version, we found a strong dependence of
cooperation on network structure and a weak one on memory, whereas in
the modified version, the structural effect was weaker than that of
memory. Most importantly, we found that the previously reported decline
of cooperation in memory-based models, typically observed at a high
memory capacity, is now prevented with the help of tags. This suggests
that the evolutionary advantages of memory capacity limits may be far
more complex than previously assumed. For much smaller systems, we
observed a quasi-symmetric alternation of the two winning groups of
strategists. This result provides an example of ingroup biased
interactions that are characterized by bursts of intra-tag cooperation
interspersed with periods of unconditional transient altruism. Such
switches of strategies may represent a boosting mechanism necessary for
the emergence and stability of global altruism in its early evolutionary
stages.}",article,ISI:000337233500002,{7},,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000337233500002},{AI9EU},{Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.},{31},{0},{22},{87},"{The authors gratefully thank the National Council for Scientific and

with an a priori hypothesis, OT and social information interact
significantly to affect the behavior of individuals with a proself value

cooperative behavior, whereas in anonymous conditions, it exacerbates
their intrinsic self-interested behavior. These effects of OT do not
hold for individuals with a prosocial value orientation, whose
cooperation levels appear to be more influenced by prior contact with

variables affect cooperative behavior in women. Cooperativeness is
evaluated through a Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). We consider several
morphometric variables related to attractiveness: fluctuating asymmetry
(FA), waist-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and facial femininity
(FF). These variables have been shown to predict human behavior. We also
include as a control variable a score for self-perceived attractiveness
(SPA). We test differences in these variables according to behavior in
the PDG. Our results reveal that low-FA women cooperate less frequently
in the PDG. We also find that women with lower WHR are more cooperative.
This result contradicts the expected relation between WHR and behavior
in the PDG. We show that this effect of WHR on cooperation operates
through its influence on the expectation that participants hold on the
cooperative intent of their counterpart. In addition, we show that the
effect of attractive features on cooperation occurs independently of the
participants' perception of their own appeal. Finally, we discuss our
results in the context of the evolution of cooperative behavior and
under the hypothesis that attractiveness is a reliable indicator of
phenotypic quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000331854300007,{2},,{ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000331854300007},{AB5UN},{Evol. Hum. Behav.},{66},{2},{11},{86},"{The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the

cooperation in the repeated game when no cooperative equilibria exist,

commonly observed strategies are better explained by inequity aversion

provide additional evidence for the relative unimportance of social
preferences. We conclude that cooperation in repeated games is primarily
motivated by long-term payoff maximization and that even though some
subjects may have other goals, this does not seem to be the key
determinant of how play varies with the parameters of the repeated game.
In particular, altruism does not seem to be a major source of the

Giuseppe","{Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social
behavior, and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a
potential cause of certain psychiatric disorders that involve social
behavioral deficits. In particular, there is growing interest in
intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric
disorders, and preliminary preclinical and clinical studies suggest
efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the
vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male,
and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of
nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has
investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human
males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of
intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as
they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma
Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human
females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we
find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP
are highly sexually differentiated. In women; AVP increased conciliatory
behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners
more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation
from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects
on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative
interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within
areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in
reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal
forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either
had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in
these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males
more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice
versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to
central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully
characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and
females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application
will be warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Attempts to modify social interaction through pharmacological manipulation have been less common. Here we show dose-dependent modification of human social behavior in a prisoner’s dilemma model after acute administration of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A modulating benzodiazepine alprazolam. Nine healthy adults received doses of placebo, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg alprazolam in a counterbalanced within-subject design, while completing multiple test blocks per day on an iterated prisoner’s dilemma game. During test blocks in which peak subjective effects of alprazolam were reported, cooperative choices were significantly decreased as a function of dose. Consistent with previous reports showing that high acute doses of GABA-modulating drugs are associated with violence and other antisocial behavior, our data suggest that at sufficiently high doses, alprazolam can decrease cooperation. These behavioral changes may be facilitated by changes in inhibitory control facilitated by GABA. Game theory paradigms may prove useful in behavioral pharmacology studies seeking to measure social interaction, and may help inform the emerging field of neuroeconomics.

This novel data set, from a series of controlled laboratory experiments, is analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical methods, the first application of such methods in this research domain. We find that individuals are much more likely to be cooperative when payoffs are deterministic than when the outcomes are probabilistic. A key factor explaining this difference is that subjects in a stochastic PD game respond not just to what their counterparts did but also to whether or not they suffered a loss. These findings are interpreted in the context of behavioral theories of commitment, altruism and reciprocity. The work provides a linkage between Bayesian statistics, experimental economics, and consumer psychology.

Cooperation can be defined in terms of its economic consequences as a joint action for mutual benefit. Two kinds of cooperation between two individuals may be distinguished selfish cooperation or mutualism and altruistic cooperation. Selfish cooperation occurs when both individuals receive immediate selfish benefits when they cooperate. Altruistic cooperation is costly to the cooperator and beneficial to the recipient in the short term. We focus on the case where the stooge plays TFT, which is a required condition to maintain the subject's cooperation at a high and stable level in experiment. Two main variables describe the situation of a one trial game-unit: the reward of the subject in a given combination and the gain of the subject cooperating after a given combination. The accumulated reward matrix over four trials is no longer a Prisoner's Dilemma matrix but a mutualism one. This matrix corresponds to another game sometimes called 'the stag hunt' and describes how mutualism (and not altruism) can arise in a population. Calculations show that the Prisoner's Dilemma reward matrix is transformed into a mutualism reward matrix, that is, a matrix describing another game, when payoffs are accumulated during four trials.

However, players who are defected against are seen as less competent, especially if they themselves cooperated (Experiments 1 and 2). Similarly, cooperators see themselves as more moral, but not as less competent, than defectors do (Experiments 3).

In this measure, choice between discrete, mutually exclusive, delayed outcomes is observed. The outcome of this self-control measure is well described by hyperbolic models of intertemporal choice. In the last ten years, a second measure of self-control has been developed, the single-player iterated prisoner's dilemma. This measure is based on a series of choices between two discrete outcomes, one of which is larger in the immediate trial, but leads to a lower overall payout while the smaller immediate outcome leads to a higher overall payout. Recent theoretical and empirical reports suggest that while the two self-control measures are unique, the same process modeled by hyperbolic discounting may also influence performance in the single-player prisoner's dilemma. To test this possibility, six experiments compared the correlation between performance on temporal discounting tasks with performance in iterated prisoner's dilemma games. Results from these experiments suggest that: (1) previous reports of a correlation between hyperbolic discounting and performance on the iterated prisoner's dilemma are replicable, but (2) this correlation is not a universal characteristic of these tasks. Rather, the relationship between the two measures is dependent on specific experimental parameters. Further explorations of the necessary parameters found that the relationship between discounting and performance on the iterated prisoner's dilemma is influenced by the type of IPD game, type of discounting task, and the probability of reciprocation used in the IPD game.

Two experiments were conducted to examine the ability of young and older adults to effectively manage an interpersonal problem that has a well-defined measure of instrumental success. Participants played an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game with same-age, computer-simulated strangers (Experiment 1) and friends (Experiment 2). Success was dependent upon one’s ability to put aside self-interest and cooperate with a partner. Computer-simulated partners reciprocated the participants’ decisions 100% of the time or behaved in a more self-interested manner. Young and older adults’ tendencies to create conflict with the reciprocating partner and their defensive reactions to the selfish partner were examined. Although young adults outperformed older adults when playing the game on their own, they did not carry this performance advantage into the interactive rounds. In fact, despite their success when playing alone, young adults were no more successful than older adults when interacting with others. Young and older adults both cooperated more with friends than with strangers and more with the reciprocating partner than the selfish partner. However, when the participants’ first interaction was with a selfish stranger, older adults were more cooperative than young adults and consequently accrued more reward. This is consistent with previous research demonstrating that older adults use more passive interpersonal problem solving strategies than young adults, and it also partially supports the prediction that advancing age leads to more effective strategy implementation when solving interpersonal problems.

We examine the leading alternative models of discounting and then apply a quasi-hyperbolic discount model to the problem of cooperation in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games.

In all, 155 adults and 157 students from second and sixth grade played these three economic games in either an ingroup, outgroup, or neutral condition. Adults and sixth-grade children allocated more to ingroup than to outgroup receivers in the dictator game, and adults punished ingroup non-cooperators more in the third-party punishment game than outgroup non-cooperators. When additional information about the other player’s past behavior was presented, adults reciprocated equally with ingroup, outgroup, and neutral players, whereas children from sixth grade reciprocated more with ingroup and neutral than with outgroup players. Overall, the results of this study support the importance of group membership and reciprocity for adults’ and older elementary school children’s altruistic behavior. For younger elementary school children, however, reciprocity and group membership do not serve as salient social information that influence their altruistic behavior.

This paper offers new theory to predict one-shot exchange structures and one-shot experiments to test that theory. As predicted, the experiments found that processes and outcomes of one-shot exchange structures are quite different from those of iterated exchange structures. For example, certain relations that are strategically used as threats in iterated exchange structures occur very rarely in one-shot structures. It follows that power differences in one-shot structures regress from those observed for repeated structures.

Using a sample of 1,000 trainee truckers we report three findings. First, there is a strong and significant relationship between an individual’s CS and preferences. Individuals with better CS are more patient, in both short- and long-run. Better CS are also associated with a greater willingness to take calculated risks. Second, CS predict social awareness and choices in a sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Subjects with better CS more accurately forecast others’ behavior and differentiate their behavior as a second mover more strongly depending on the first-mover’s choice. Third, CS, and in particular, the ability to plan, strongly predict perseverance on the job in a setting with a substantial financial penalty for early exit. Consistent with CS being a common factor in all of these preferences and behaviors, we find a strong pattern of correlation among them. These results, taken together with the theoretical explanation we offer for the relationships we find, suggest that higher CS systematically affect preferences and choices in ways that favor economic success.

However, the underlying neural mechanism is not well understood. We conducted a neuroimaging experiment in which subjects maximized monetary rewards by learning in a prisoner’s dilemma game with two computer agents: agent A, a tit-for-tat player who repeats the subject’s previous action, and agent B, a simple stochastic cooperator oblivious to the subject’s action. Approximately 1/3 of the subjects (group I) learned optimally in relation to both A and B, while another 1/3 (group II) did so only for B. Post experiment interviews indicated that group I exploited the agent strategies more often than group II. Significant differences in learning-related brain activity between the two groups were only found in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for both A and B. Furthermore, the learning performance of each group I subject was predictable based on this STS activity, but not in the group II subjects. This differential activity could not be attributed to a behavioral difference since it persisted in relation to agent B for which the two groups behaved similarly. In sharp contrast, the brain structures for reward processing were recruited similarly by both groups. These results suggest that STS provides knowledge of the other agent’s strategies for association between action and reward and highlights learning competence during interactive reinforcement learning.

It has long been hypothesised that women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2) game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n=12) and women (n=12) interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ, constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the human partner>computer partner contrast. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of participants and the game partner.

This phenomenon is captured by prisoner’s dilemma games, in which cooperation rates appear to be determined by the distinctive structure of economic incentives (e.g., $3 for mutual cooperation vs. $5 for unilateral defection). Rather than comparing economic values of cooperating versus not ($3 vs. $5), we tested the hypothesis that players simply compare numeric values (3 vs. 5), such that subjective numbers (mental magnitudes) are logarithmically scaled. Supporting our hypothesis, increasing only numeric values of rewards (from $3 to 300b) increased cooperation (Study 1), whereas increasing economic values increased cooperation only when there were also numeric increases (Study 2). Thus, changing rewards from 3b to 300b increased cooperation rates, but an economically identical change from 3b to $3 elicited no gains. Finally, logarithmically scaled reward values predicted 97% of variation in cooperation, whereas the face value of economic rewards predicted none.

We demonstrate that, when playing against choice strategies that are not biased by such factors, perceptual biases disappear and only assimilation bias caused by reinforcement persists.

University students from Japan, China, and Taiwan participated in experiments involving participants from their own society and another society in real time using an intercultural trust paradigm derived from a game theoretic and evolutionary approach to social exchange. The modified trust game improves on the Prisoner's Dilemma Game by eliminating greed as an explanation for lack of cooperation: the truster unilaterally decides whether or not to trust their exchange partner, and the allocator then decides whether or not to divide the reward fairly between the two of them. Participants earned real money by playing six rounds of one-shot trust games with three in-group members and three out-group members over the Internet. Across three experiments involving two interacting societies each, Japanese were found to be less trusting and trustworthy exchange partners compared to cultural Chinese. This suggests that Japanese collectivism is based more on long-term assurance networks, whereas Chinese collectivism provides a more expansive, guanxi-based approach to building new social networks. Japanese also showed less in-group favoritism in both trust and trustworthiness (or conditional fairness) at the national-level compared to cultural Chinese, suggesting that culture-specific content (e.g., collective guilt for WWII) may influence ethnocentrism at the national level.

In this study, we probed the behavioral, emotional, and neural correlates of psychopathic traits within the context of a dyadic social interaction. Methods: Thirty subjects were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game with human confederates who were outside the scanner. Subjects also completed two self-report psychopathy questionnaires. Results: Subjects scoring higher on psychopathy, particularly males, defected more often and were less likely to continue cooperating after establishing mutual cooperation with a partner. Further, they experienced more outcomes in which their cooperation was not reciprocated (cooperate-defect outcome). After such outcomes, subjects scoring high in psychopathy showed less amygdala activation, suggesting weaker aversive conditioning to those outcomes. Compared with low-psychopathy subjects, subjects higher in psychopathy also showed weaker activation within orbitofrontal cortex when choosing to cooperate and showed weaker activation within dorsolateral prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex when choosing to defect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that whereas subjects scoring low on psychopathy have emotional biases toward cooperation that can only be overcome with effortful cognitive control, subjects scoring high on psychopathy have an opposing bias toward defection that likewise can only be overcome with cognitive effort.

Two graph-theoretic characteristics--clustering coefficient and characteristic path length--exhibited a significant effect on individual behavior, possibly explaining why the small-world network, with its high clustering coefficient and short path length, is the architecture of relations that drive a system towards equilibrium at the quickest pace.

The physical appearance stereotypes literature has established that target's attractiveness elicits favorable impressions such as sociability, competence and honesty, and that target's babyfaceness elicits impressions such as warmth and incompetence. The SVO literature has shown that prosocials consider cooperation along the dimension of morality or evaluation, whereas proselfs consider cooperation along the dimension of power or potency, and their different goals affect what each thinks constitutes rational behavior. Building on those findings, this study tested the hypotheses that SVO moderates the effect of target attractiveness, but not facial maturity, on perceived cooperativeness; that prosocials cooperate with targets according to their perception of target cooperativeness, but proselfs are not cooperative; and that both prosocials and proselfs' selection preference corresponds to their perception of target cooperativeness. Sixty-four college undergraduates played one-shot prisoner's dilemma games with presumed other participants, who were in reality pre-selected target photographs whose levels of attractiveness and babyfaceness were controlled. Participants selected targets with whom to play the game, decided how cooperative to be by choosing the amount of money to offer, estimated how cooperative the targets had been, and rated targets on trait impressions. Consistent with the hypotheses, prosocials but not proselfs expected more cooperation from attractive targets than from unattractive targets, although only for female targets. Also, both prosocials and proselfs expected more cooperation from babyfaced targets. Contrary to the a priori hypotheses, however, participants cooperated slightly more with attractive targets regardless of their SVO, and chose them more frequently than unattractive targets. Facial maturity did not affect how cooperative participants were, and prosocials chose babyfaced targets more frequently but proselfs chose babyfaced and maturefaced targets similarly often. Overall the results replicated the prior literature on the function of physical appearance stereotypes, while providing limited support for the hypothesized role of SVO as a variable moderating this effect.

Explanations for the discontinuity effect have focused on norms, schemas, identifiability, and rationalization. Although, personality factors, in general, have received limited attention, Wildschut and Insko (2006) found that dispositional guilt of group members predicted competition in an intergroup prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) but only when group members were told that their decisions would be made public to their fellow ingroup members. The present studies sought to extend these findings by measuring guilt as well as other related personality variables (e.g., shame, empathy, and psychopathy) and assessing their relationships with intergroup competition when decisions remained private (in Study 1) and when decisions were made public (in Study 2). Study 1, in which decisions remained private, showed no relationship between guilt and intergroup competition, whereas Study 2, in which decisions were made public, revealed mixed results.

F.","Researchers in organizational science often assume a constant environment when studying relationships between organizations. The problem is that this perspective is increasingly difficult to reconcile with the view of organizations as living systems (living organizations) responding to a dynamic environment. The purpose of this research was to understand the effect a dynamic environment has upon a specific type of organization, the network organization - where groups interact cooperatively and pool resources rather than compete in a hierarchical setting. Such an understanding is important for both theoreticians and managers. Using a mixed methodology, the study explored what happens when the assumption of a constant environment is changed to a dynamic environment. Inferential content analysis established the importance of a dynamic environment for understanding organizations as living systems. Using the Prisoner's Dilemma, a computer simulation further evaluated the effects a dynamic environment has on organizational operations. T test comparisons showed that the change from a static to a dynamic environment is essential for the continued development of the concept of living organizations as open systems with the ability to effectively respond to feedback from the surrounding environment. This study strengthens recognition of the network organization as a new type of managerial structure, which reduces the authority of upper level managers and gives employees more responsibility for inter-organizational decision-making. Understanding the effects of a dynamic environment and the benefits of networked organizations may provide managers with the ability to more effectively respond to global challenges.

in a six-person prisoner's dilemma game in which actors observe others'
cooperation with some noise (i.e. imperfect public monitoring). Previous
research has shown that peer punishment can sustain cooperation, if a
certain proportion of group members punish defectors at a cost to
themselves. However, in the presence of noise, co-operators will
sometimes be mistaken for defectors and punished, and defectors will
sometimes be mistaken for co-operators and escape punishment. Both types
of mistakes are detrimental for cooperation because cooperation is
discouraged and defection is encouraged. By means of a laboratory
experiment, we study whether this adverse effect of noise can be
mitigated by consensual punishment. The more other group members have to
agree on punishing a defector, the less likely will a co-operator be
punished by mistake. We compare a punishment institution in which each
subject decides individually whether to punish another, with
institutions in which punishments are only implemented if subjects reach
sufficient consensus that a particular group member should be punished.
In conditions without noise, we find that cooperation and subjects'
payoffs are higher if more consensus is required before a punishment is
implemented. In conditions with noise, cooperation is lower if more
consensus is required. Moreover, with noise, subjects' payoffs are lower
under all punishment institutions than in the control condition without
punishment opportunities. Our results narrow down the conditions under
which punishment institutions can promote cooperation if such
cooperation is noisy.}",article,ISI:000416291900087,{11},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000416291900087},{FN8QZ},{PLoS One},{2},{0},{0},{59},"{Funding for this research was provided by the Netherlands Organization

very high levels of cooperative activity. It is widely observed that,
when norms can be enforced by peer punishment, groups are able to
resolve social dilemmas in prosocial, cooperative ways. Here we show
that punishment can also encourage participation in destructive
behaviours that are harmful to group welfare, and that this phenomenon
is mediated by a social norm. In a variation of a public goods game, in
which the return to investment is negative for both group and
individual, we find that the opportunity to punish led to higher levels
of contribution, thereby harming collective payoffs. A second experiment
confirmed that, independently of whether punishment is available, a
majority of subjects regard the efficient behaviour of non-contribution
as socially inappropriate. The results show that simply providing a
punishment opportunity does not guarantee that punishment will be used
for socially beneficial ends, because the social norms that influence
punishment behaviour may themselves be destructive.}",article,ISI:000411315800002,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000411315800002},{FH6US},{Nat. Commun.},{19},{1},{9},{46},"{We thank research assistants Ben Grodeck, Mark Howard, Sarah Meehan and

they can sanction any outsiders they observe. We vary the insiders'

partial and full observability. We find a striking non-monotonicity
between observability of the outsiders and levels of poaching. Poaching
was higher under partial monitoring than zero monitoring, and was lower

allowed the insiders to better coordinate their own harvests, they were
unable to fully deter poaching because their sanctions were far too low

Tragedy of the Commons, but one is an inferior solution because it leads
to assured resource destruction. We use a single-period laboratory

Agent-based simulation}",{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS},{0936-9937},"Zeng, Weijun and Li, Minqiang and Feng, Nan","{This paper addresses the evolution of cooperation in a multi-agent
system with agents interacting heterogeneously with each other based on
the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) game. The heterogeneity of
interaction is defined in two models. First, agents in a network are
restricted to interacting with only their neighbors (local interaction).
Second, agents are allowed to adopt different IPD strategies against
different opponents (discriminative interaction). These two
heterogeneous interaction scenarios are different to the classical
evolutionary game, in which each agent interacts with every other agent
in the population by adopting the same strategy against all opponents.
Moreover, agents adapt their risk attitudes while engaging in
interactions. Agents with payoffs above (or below) their aspirations
will become more risk averse (or risk seeking) in subsequent
interactions, wherein risk is defined as the standard deviation of
one-move payoffs in the IPD game. In simulation experiments with agents
using only own historical payoffs as aspirations (historical
comparison), we find that the whole population can achieve a high level
of cooperation via the risk attitude adaptation mechanism, in the cases
of either local or discriminative interaction models. Meanwhile, when
agents use the population's average payoff as aspirations (social
comparison) for adapting risk attitudes, the high level of cooperation
can only be sustained in a portion of the population (i.e., partial
cooperation). This finding also holds true in both of the heterogeneous
scenarios. Considering that payoffs cannot be precisely estimated in a
realistic IPD game, simulation experiments are also conducted with a
Gaussian disturbance added to the game payoffs. The results reveal that
partial cooperation in the population under social comparison is more
robust to the variation in payoffs than the global cooperation under
historical comparison.}",article,ISI:000405019700003,{3},,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000405019700003},{EZ8ZV},{J. Evol. Econ.},{18},{0},{4},{43},"{This study was supported by the National Science Fund for Distinguished

Experimental research in behavioral economics has recently adopted
dual-system theories of the mind from psychology in order to address
this question. This research uses response time data in public good
games to distinguish between the two distinct cognitive processes. We
extend this literature towards environmental public goods by analyzing
response time data from an online experiment in which over 3400 subjects
from the general population faced a dichotomous choice between receiving
a monetary payment or contributing to climate change mitigation efforts.
Our evidence confirms a strong positive link between response times and
contributions: The average response time of contributors is 40 \% higher
than that of non-contributors. This suggests that reflection, not
intuition, is at the root of pro-environmental contributions. This
result is robust to a comprehensive set of robustness checks, including
a within-subjects analysis that controls for potentially unobserved

findings are compatible with two different mechanisms for the evolution
of cooperation. It may be that dynamic networks promote cooperation even
in networks composed entirely of egoists, who strategically cooperate to
attract and maintain profitable interaction partners. Alternatively,
drawing on recent insights into heterogeneous social preferences, we
expect that dynamic networks will increase cooperation only when nodes
are occupied by persons with more prosocial preferences, who tend to
attract and keep more cooperative partners relative to egoists. Our
experiment used a standard procedure to classify participants a priori
as egoistic or prosocial and then embedded them in homogeneous networks
of all prosocials or all egoists, or in heterogeneous networks (50/50).
Participants then interacted in repeated prisoner's dilemma games with
alters in both static and dynamic networks. In both heterogeneous and
homogeneous networks, we find dynamic networks only promote cooperation
among prosocials. Resulting from their greater cooperation, prosocials'

been to explain why cooperation survives despite being a seemingly
inferior strategy from an evolutionary point of view. Over the years,
various theoretical scenarios aimed at solving the evolutionary puzzle
of cooperation have been proposed, eventually identifying several
cooperation-promoting mechanisms: kin selection, direct reciprocity,
indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. We
report the results of repeated Prisoner's Dilemma experiments with
anonymous and onymous pairwise interactions among individuals. We find
that onymity significantly increases the frequency of cooperation and
the median payoff per round relative to anonymity. Furthermore, we also
show that the correlation between players' ranks and the usage of
strategies (cooperation, defection, or punishment) underwent a
fundamental shift, whereby more prosocial actions are rewarded with a
better ranking under onymity. Our findings prove that reducing anonymity
is a valid promoter of cooperation, leading to higher payoffs for
cooperators and thus suppressing an incentive-anonymity-that would
ultimately favor defection.}",article,ISI:000416722700006,{3},,{AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000416722700006},{FO3IY},{Sci. Adv.},{41},{4},{137},{36},"{We appreciate the support from National Natural Science Foundation of

costly material sanctions. In addition, members of moral judgment groups
subsequently showed more interpersonal trust, trustworthiness, and

human nature for utilizing common pool resources, thus compromising
sustainability. To test this hypothesis, we design and implement a set
of dynamic common pool resource games and experiments in the following
two types of Nepalese areas: ( i) rural ( non-capitalistic) and ( ii)

individuals in urban areas is lower than that in rural areas, and urban
residents deplete resources more quickly than rural residents. The
composition of proself and prosocial individuals in a group and the
degree of capitalism are crucial in that an increase in prosocial
members in a group and the rural dummy positively affect resource
sustainability by 65\% and 63\%, respectively. Overall, this paper shows
that when societies move toward more capitalistic environments, the
sustainability of common pool resources tends to decrease with the
changes in individual preferences, social norms, customs and views to
others through human interactions. This result implies that individuals

means of a systematic content analysis of communication transcripts from
field experiments. The paper analyzes communication statements shared by
participants in a series of common-pool resource experiments conducted
in rural Colombia. We first classified each statement under two
categories: topic and function. Then, we tested hypotheses about the
impact of those statements on cooperation depending on (1) their
reference to the ``field context{''} and other topic categories; and (2)
the ``informational{''}, ``disapproval{''}, or ``group solidarity{''}

contain references to the context affect cooperation depending on the
function of those statements. When the statements fulfill an information
role, the effect is negative, but when statements have the function of
enhancing group solidarity, the effect is positive. The statements that
have the strongest positive impact on cooperation are those fulfilling a
disapproval function, particularly when the topic of the messages are

experimental study}",{1078-1091},"{Experiment; Conservation; Cultural and historical information; Public

properties classified as being part of the cultural heritage of a city,
owners of these properties face a lower incentive to maintain them. Many
studies have advocated the participation of the local community in the
maintenance of such ``public{''} properties because community demands
and tastes are better reflected through direct participation than
through government intervention. One of the main factors that may
determine whether or not such participation would be forthcoming is
whether the community identifies with elements that the cultural
heritage building represents. The purpose of this paper is to examine
the cultural effects of the Chinese community with regard to the
preservation of the heritage buildings that reflect the community's
early presence in George Town, Penang.
Design/methodology/approach - An experimental method was used to invoke
feelings of social identity through historical and cultural photos about
these buildings associated with the community. The authors attempted to
create an emotional attachment to the cultural and historical values in
a laboratory.
Findings - The authors found that information increased the
participants' positive feelings toward their historical and cultural
backgrounds. This positive emotion might explain why the subjects
appeared more willing to contribute to the public pool to maintain these
buildings. The findings suggest that the incorporating cultural and
historical information about heritage buildings may encourage more
pro-social behaviors.
Social implications - Although community participation and discussions
can help to align the conservation objectives of diverse stakeholders,
the divergence between individual and collective interests may cause
individuals to shirk from their commitment, given the public nature of
the goods. Therefore, investigating whether a factor that aligns diverse
interests or the nature of the game can influence behavior is important
to the development of strategies used in the provision of public good.
Originality/value - Although the impact of social identity on social
dilemma has been widely studied, the empirical proof and its application
to preservation of cultural heritage has not been studied. As far as the
authors know, this is the first paper that experimentally proves the
importance of social identity and its role in provision of social goods.}",article,ISI:000405479400006,{8},,{EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000405479400006},{FA5JN},{Int. J. Soc. Econ.},{8},{1},{2},{33},,,"{Chng, Kean Siang/0000-0003-2154-5715

in which both punishment responsibility and exposure differ across
players. Average contributions are significantly lower in the Asymmetric

asymmetry among a player's potential punishment targets may lead to
discriminatory patterns of punishment. In particular, players might wish
to punish targets for whom they are solely responsible discriminately
more than targets for whom they share responsibility. The experimental
data do not support this hypothesis, although they do suggest a
compelling explanation as to why. Specifically, we find that the under
monitored player in the network retaliates against previous punishment
significantly more often than others in the group, which deters their
only potential punisher from issuing stronger sanctions. Thus, an
additional complication of asymmetry in the network is that it may lead
to more instances of anti-social retaliation, inhibiting the
effectiveness of the decentralized punishment institution. (C) 2016

their strategies under different expected payoffs, depending on their
social status or social situations. When looking at sex differences in
cooperation, the existing studies have found that the genders cooperate
at similar frequencies. However, the majority of the data originate
within Western human societies. In this paper, we explore whether there
are gender differences in cooperation in China. An Iterated Prisoner's
Dilemma game with a punishment option was used to gather data about
Southwest Chinese subjects in a culture in which men have a hierarchical
advantage over women. Results indicate that men invested into partners
significantly more than women did (34\% male vs. 24\% female) while
women, in turn, were more likely to defect (65\% female vs. 50\% male).
In this region, women have customarily held less economic power and they
are used to obtain a payoff typically lower than men. We suggest that
the women's willingness to invest in cooperation has decreased
throughout evolutionary time, providing us with an illustration of a
culturally-driven shift towards a disparity in gender cooperation

cooperation. Several classical studies have suggested that humans should
quickly learn to adopt reciprocal strategies to establish mutual
cooperation in repeated interactions. On the other hand, the recently
discovered theory of ZD strategies has found that subjects who use
extortionate strategies are able to exploit and subdue cooperators.
Although such extortioners have been predicted to succeed in any
population of adaptive opponents, theoretical follow-up studies
questioned whether extortion can evolve in reality. However, most of
these studies presumed that individuals have similar strategic
possibilities and comparable outside options, whereas asymmetries are
ubiquitous in real world applications. Here we show with a model and an
economic experiment that extortionate strategies readily emerge once
subjects differ in their strategic power. Our experiment combines a
repeated social dilemma with asymmetric partner choice. In our main
treatment there is one randomly chosen group member who is unilaterally
allowed to exchange one of the other group members after every ten
rounds of the social dilemma. We find that this asymmetric replacement
opportunity generally promotes cooperation, but often the resulting
payoff distribution reflects the underlying power structure. Almost half
of the subjects in a better strategic position turn into extortioners,
who quickly proceed to exploit their peers. By adapting their
cooperation probabilities consistent with ZD theory, extortioners force
their co-players to cooperate without being similarly cooperative
themselves. Comparison to non-extortionate players under the same
conditions indicates a substantial net gain to extortion. Our results
thus highlight how power asymmetries can endanger mutually beneficial
interactions, and transform them into exploitative relationships. In
particular, our results indicate that the extortionate strategies
predicted from ZD theory could play a more prominent role in our daily
interactions than previously thought.}",article,ISI:000385696900024,{10},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000385696900024},{DZ2UK},{PLoS One},{18},{0},{8},{52},,,"{Hilbe, Christian/0000-0001-5116-955X}","{Hilbe, Christian/K-9412-2013}","{christian.hilbe@ist.ac.at

guide decisions about social or economic interactions with individuals
otherwise unknown. Usually, information about prospective counterparts
is incomplete, often being limited to an average success rate.
Uncertainty on reputation is further increased by fraud, which is
increasingly becoming a cause of concern. To address these issues, we
have designed an experiment based on the Prisoner's Dilemma as a model
for social interactions. Participants could spend money to have their
observable cooperativeness increased. We find that the aggregate
cooperation level is practically unchanged, i.e., global behavior does
not seem to be affected by unreliable reputations. However, at the
individual level we find two distinct types of behavior, one of reliable
subjects and one of cheaters, where the latter artificially fake their
reputation in almost every interaction. Cheaters end up being better off
than honest individuals, who not only keep their true reputation but are
also more cooperative. In practice, this results in honest subjects
paying the costs of fraud as cheaters earn the same as in a truthful
environment. These findings point to the importance of ensuring the
truthfulness of reputation for a more equitable and fair society.}",article,ISI:000376852900001,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000376852900001},{DN1VG},{Sci Rep},{24},{0},{10},{45},"{A.

anonymous interactions is, on average, spontaneous, rather than

internalize cooperative heuristics in their everyday life and bring them
as intuitive strategies in new and atypical situations. Yet, these
studies have important limitations, as they promote intuitive responses
using weak time pressure or conceptual priming of intuition. Since these
manipulations do not deplete participants' ability to reason completely,
it remains unclear whether cooperative heuristics are really automatic
or they emerge after a small, but positive, amount of deliberation.
Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we report two experiments
demonstrating that spontaneous reactions in one-shot anonymous
interactions tend to be egoistic. In doing so, our findings shed further
light on the cognitive underpinnings of cooperation, as they suggest
that cooperation in one-shot interactions is not automatic, but appears

equivalent to a binary choice between the acquisition of perfect
information on the target subject's behavior and no information at all.
When monitoring is costly both second and third party punishment is
weaker and less discriminate and hence generates weaker incentives for
cooperation than when monitoring is free. There are subtle differences
between second and third parties: The presence of monitoring costs leads
subjects to withhold sanctioning more often as second parties than as
third parties, and to punish indiscriminately more often as third
parties than as second parties. The results contribute to the
understanding of peer-enforcement of cooperation in social dilemmas and
whether there is a common motivational structure underpinning second and

and influence to address the conditions under which group leaders solve
collective action problems. We show how leaders' behaviors impact the
success of collective action groups as a whole via both power and
influence processes. In a laboratory experiment, groups first completed
a baseline measure of cooperation in a public good dilemma without
punishment. In a second phase, the capacity to punish was introduced.
One condition, the ``peer-sanctioning condition,{''} was equivalent to
the prevailing solution in the experimental literature on collective
action, where the ability to punish others is distributed equally among
all group members. In the other two conditions, only a single group
``leader{''} could punish; we varied whether the person assigned to lead
was other-regarding (prosocial) or self-regarding (proself). The results
support our prediction that prosocial leaders increase their
contributions to the group after ascending to leadership, while proself
leaders reduce their contributions. Further, as expected, rank-and-file
group members are influenced by leaders' contribution behaviors; as a
result, prosocial-led groups as a whole were substantially more
productive than proself-led groups. Indeed, as predicted, prosocial
leaders were even more effective in maintaining large group
contributions than the standard peer-sanctioning system. These findings
suggest that putting power and influence in the right hands solves
collective action problems and promotes collective welfare.}",article,ISI:000371609000043,{3},,{OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC},,,{2020-11-06},{Green Published},{ISI:000371609000043},{DF8LJ},{Soc. Forces},{27},{1},{16},{69},"{This work was supported by a SPARC Graduate Research Grant from the

that no behavioral variability and no effect of SVO on behavior were

moderate the effect of SVO on behavior in situations where behavior
showed variability. No moderating effect was found for incentive

problems of free riding and problems of provider accountability
frequently coincide. How are voluntary contributions to a public good
sustained when they are vulnerable to rent extraction by a third party?
In a laboratory experiment, I test whether contributions in a public
goods dilemma can be decentrally enforced through costly, mutual
sanctioning capacity, even if the contributions can be misappropriated
by a third party. I find that costly sanctioning capacity among the
beneficiaries of a public good can substantially reduce free riding,
without increasing the rate at which contributions are misappropriated
by the provider. However, this effect can be undermined if mutual
sanctioning capacity exists between the third-party provider and the
beneficiaries. Contrary to existing predictions, social sanctioning
relationships which both embed the provider and encompass the
beneficiaries of a public good are not associated with greater, but
partly with lower public goods provision than sanctioning relationships
which are only embedding or encompassing.}",article,ISI:000368197300005,"{1, SI}",,{SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000368197300005},{DB0KP},{J. Theor. Polit.},{7},{0},{2},{47},"{The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for

administration to encourage citizen participation in collective action

globalization, arguing that people vary in the extent to which they are
globalized and that an individual's level of globalism (ILG) reflects
attitudes and dispositions that influence the way he or she resolves the
social dilemma of participation in collective action (i.e., the decision
to contribute versus follow a free-ride strategy). Using a four-country
sample, the article examines the relationship between ILG and collective
action participation decisions in three behavioral experiments. Findings
support the hypothesis that regardless of country-level globalization, a
more globalized individual complies less willingly with tax codes,
donates less to local nongovernmental organizations, and prefers to
adopt a free-ride strategy in a public goods game. The consequences for
public administration are discussed.}",article,ISI:000367313700022,{1},,{WILEY},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000367313700022},{CZ7XK},{Public Adm. Rev.},{41},{5},{11},{62},,,"{Vashdi, Dana/0000-0003-3644-2129}","{Vashdi, Dana/AAU-8695-2020

that policy-makers evaluate costs and benefits of cooperation when
designing treaties and subsequently deciding on participation. To
influence this cost-benefit calculus, treaty designers sometimes include
a fund from which financial assistance is provided to treaty members and
to which treaty members contribute. We argue that the inclusion of a
funding mechanism in a treaty can increase but also decrease the costs
(benefits) of membership and can thus influence state choices on
participation in both directions. Specifically, we argue that: (1)
overall, states are more likely to join international agreements that
include a fund; (2) the probability of joining is higher for agreements
including a fund if contributions to the fund are voluntary; and (3)
countries are more likely to join agreements including a fund that
disburses assistance only to a select group of treaty members. We test
these arguments using a new dataset with information on 154 countries'
ratification behavior toward 178 multilateral environmental agreements
(MEAs) from 1950 to 2011. Our findings are in line with these arguments.
The main policy implication is that MEA designers interested in
maximizing treaty participation should include a formal funding
mechanism and, in an effort to balance out positive and negative effects
this might have on participation, base this mechanism on voluntary
contributions and selective entitlements.}",article,ISI:000458192900001,{1},,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000458192900001},{HK7TP},{Int. Environ. Agreem.-Polit.

carbon emission reductions. These effort contributions decrease as peers
accept an offer to contribute money instead of effort. However, the

Such situations are ubiquitous, e.g., in not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY)

together, our results establish that perceptions and behavior in

session, this paper aims at understanding how different contexts may
influence participants' choices. This paper focuses on one hybrid
experimental session that mixed one voluntary contributions mechanism
(VCM), influencing the indemnity received by participants, and one
mechanism eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for milk bottles with
public and private attributes. The VCM shows relatively high levels of
contributions that are mainly influenced by the positive expectations of
participants about the average group contribution, rather than by the
variations in the design of this mechanism and the period of
experiments. The WTP for milk bottles are particularly sensitive to the
order of mechanisms and to the period of experiments. Conversely, the
WTP differences between milk bottles for a given round of information
are invariant across the order of mechanisms and the period of
experiments. For each bottle, the variations of WTP coming from the
messages about private and public attributes are also stable over the
order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. This confers validity
to experiments for measuring WTP for public and private attributes
related to food. In other words, these variations of WTP contribute to
welfare estimates and are useful to evaluate market regulations focusing
on public and/or private attributes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

water-logging and losses in crop yield. Although timely maintenance of
canals through regular contributions from the community can solve this
problem, it often breaks down because of the free riding issue, a common
feature in the provision of public goods. Previous literature on
experimental games has shown how different communication strategies or
leadership can help to achieve coordination. We conducted experimental
games with the aims to: (i) determine the effectiveness of these
different strategies in the specific problem of maintenance of canal;
and (ii) compare the relative effectiveness of different communication
mechanisms or leadership. Playing these games was also a part of a
participatory action research approach with the idea that community
members would have a clearer understanding of the incentives and
constraints of contribution for canal maintenance. The basic insight
from our study is that any institution that enables more information
sharing about both the intended contribution and setting the group norm
translates into better coordination among the users to increase the
group income towards Pareto Optimum outcomes. The lessons from these
games could potentially open up a forum of discussion and help the
villagers in their future communications as a tool for understanding and
testing different alternatives for community management of natural
resources. The results are also of interest for development

the decision to restrict access to information is an endogenous choice

To address this question, we adopt a single-shot collective action game

not have an effect beyond that of just starting over. In contrast, a

response to the defection of others. In some cases, however, group
members not only cooperate in the face of defection but also compensate
for the shortfalls caused by others' defection. In one field and two lab
studies, we examined when group members were willing to compensate for
versus match defection using sequential dilemmas. We found that the
level of identification with the broader group increased willingness to
compensate for intragroup defection, even when it was personally costly.
Compensating for a defecting partner's actions, however, is not an act
of unconditional cooperation: It is accompanied by a lack of trust in
the errant group member and a desire to be perceived as more ethical.
Cooperation by others, on the other hand, is matched independent of
whether the cooperator was an in-group or out-group member. We find
similar patterns of compensation and matching when the personal cost
involved contributing money or effort. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

their marginal costs of abatement. The experiment consists of two games:
a counterfactual baseline scenario examining the scope for voluntary
cooperation and a communication game examining the role of stakeholder
participation in facilitating cooperation. During the communication
game, subjects are able to communicate with one another in order to
coordinate contribution strategies. The results suggest that relying on
the voluntary cooperation of individuals will not be sufficient to meet
the mitigation target. Furthermore, while communication plays a role in
promoting cooperation, even when heterogeneity is present, the
non-binding nature of communication results in significant levels of
free-riding. In particular, with the introduction of communication, two
dominant contribution norms of free-riding and perfect-cooperation
emerge. This outcome emphasizes the importance of sanctioning

however, their consequences on economic behaviour have received only
limited attention. This paper investigates the effects of induced
positive and negative emotions on cooperation and sanctioning behaviour
in a one-shot voluntary contributions mechanism game, where personal and
social interests are at odds. We concentrate on two specific emotions:
anger and happiness. Our findings provide clear evidence that measures
of social preferences are sensitive to subjects' current emotional
states. Specifically, angry subjects contribute, on average, less than
happy subjects and overall welfare as measured by average net earnings
is lower when subjects are in an angry mood. We also find that how
punishment is used is affected by moods: angry subjects punish harsher
than happy subjects, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that anger,
when induced, can have a negative impact on economic behaviour. (C) 2015

surprisingly, preferences over institutions are generally independent of

endowments, strong/weak identity, and absence/presence of peer

cooperation in homogenous and heterogeneous teams, but that the effect
depends on the strength of the identity. When punishment is introduced,
the impact of punishment depends on the strength of the
identity-building activity and the effectiveness of punishment.
Furthermore, we find no evidence of stronger cooperation or punishment
in teams with strong identity. These findings provide important
implications for management policy makers in organizations: ex ante
income heterogeneity should be implemented in teams with caution, and
the decision of whether identity or punishment is a more effective norm
enforcement mechanism in teams is rather sensitive to their interaction

frequently terminated with collapse of the resource, there is
considerable evidence in real-world settings that challenges this
finding. To reconcile this difference, we propose a two-stage model that
links appropriation of the CPR and provision of public goods in an
attempt to explain the emergence of cooperation in the management of
CPRs under environmental uncertainty. Benchmark predictions are derived
from the model, and subsequently tested experimentally under different
marginal cost-benefit structures concerning the voluntary contribution
to the provision of the good. Our results suggest that the severity of
the appropriation problem may significantly be mitigated by the presence

Bolivia to investigate the effect that local authorities have on
voluntary public good provision. In our study, community members pool
resources to provide environmental education material for local schools.
We find that voluntary contributions increase when democratically
elected local authorities lead by example. The results are driven by two
factors: (1) authorities, like other individuals, give more when they
are called upon to lead than when they give in private, and (2) high
leader contributions increase the likelihood that others follow. Both
effects are stronger when authorities, as compared to randomly selected
community members, lead by example. We explore two underlying sources of
leadership influence. First, we provide evidence that the effect of a
leader's contribution is not limited to signaling the value of the
public good. Second, we examine how leader characteristics affect the
likelihood that others follow. Specifically, our study shows that
authority influence is driven by a combination of formal leadership
status, observable characteristics, and the amount that authorities
contribute when they give publicly before others. (C) 2014 The Authors.

investigated when there is probabilistic uncertainty about the monetary
return from production of the public good. After group members make
their provision decisions, the return is drawn from an exogenously
determined probability distribution. In a linear decision setting,
voluntary provision of the public good is contrasted across three
treatments. In the ``uncertainA{''} treatment, the return is randomly
drawn from a discrete probability distribution. In the ``uncertainB{''}
treatment, the return is drawn from a discrete probability distribution
that is a mean-preserving spread of the distribution in the uncertainA
treatment, but has larger variance. In the ``certain{''} treatment, the
return is known with certainty and equal to the expected value of the
return in the uncertainA and uncertainB treatments. The data reveal that
average provision of the public good is lower in treatments with
uncertainty. However, the negative impact of uncertainty on provision
only occurs when subjects experience the certain treatment prior to
experiencing an uncertain treatment, suggesting an order effect to
uncertainty. Also, there is evidence that subjects in treatments with
higher uncertainty (variance of the public-good return) display a

contrast, have a positive and stabilizing effect on voluntary

externalities contributions have on the other group members' payoffs

Within a linear public good game, we experimentally investigate two

If social returns are equal across groups, subjects prefer to contribute
to the local group that offers social information on individual

initially attracts more contributions, but this tendency quickly
unravels in favor of cooperation in the local group. Cooperation in the

experimentally tests the effect of cultural and historical information

We devise 4 treatments: a Control treatment, a treatment where subjects
are provided with cultural and historical information pertaining to the
heritage houses, a treatment that includes a contribution threshold, and
finally a treatment that combines the use of cultural and historical
information with the contribution threshold. The main finding shows that
60-75 \% of the subjects contributed more than what they believed others
in the same group would contribute when they were provided with the
pertinent cultural and historical information. Most of the subjects
contributed less than their belief, while 75-77 \% cooperated
`selfishly' in treatments without the information. These findings are in
agreement with the literature, namely that contributions are higher in
treatments with a contribution threshold. Moreover, the combination of a

efficiency. This paper uses an experimental design to directly test
this. Data from 1,200 married couples in Ethiopia were collected using
treatments that vary initial endowments of spouses, final allocation

Efficiency is decisively rejected in all treatments. Information
improves efficiency only in some treatments, suggesting that the role of
information is context dependent. Husbands expectations of their wives
contributions are higher than their wives actual contributions, and
wives expectations of their husbands contributions are lower than their
husbands actual contributions. These systematic errors in expected and
actual behaviour imply that the attainment of equilibrium as in a game
theoretic framework is unlikely. Statistical tests indicate that instead
of efficiency, other considerations are likely important. Overall, most

are used as cues for a propensity to cooperate. However, further studies
of the human ability to visually detect cooperativeness are required. In
particular, the existence of static facial cues of altruism remains
questionable. Moreover, an investigation of both sex differences and
cross-cultural applicability with respect to altruism detection skills
is crucial in the context of the evolution of human cooperation. In this
study, we used both a public good game and a charitable contribution to
assess the cooperativeness of 156 men and 172 women in rural Senegal and
took facial photographs of these individuals. The second portion of the
study was conducted in France. In total, 194 men and 171 women were
asked to distinguish the most and least selfish individual from a series
of 80 pairs of Senegalese facial photographs, each pair consisting of
the highest and the lowest contributor from a group in the public good
game. Using mixed modeling techniques, we controlled for facial
masculinity, age and socioeconomic status. For male pairs, both male and
female French raters were able to identify more often than by chance
which individual made the smallest contribution to the public good in
each group; however, detection was not successful with female faces.
These results suggest that sex-specific traits are involved and that
only male facial traits indicating cooperative skills are, at least
inter-culturally, readable. The specific facial traits involved are
investigated. However, the charitable contribution was not correlated
with the contribution to the public good, and further work is necessary
to identify which specific altruistic traits are detectable and to
assess the generality of these results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Results indicate that providing groups the opportunity to communicate

Importantly, the pro-social effects of communication and voting are
strongest when the status quo endowment is the private account, which
generates costs on other participants. This result suggests that the

we demonstrate that uninvolved individuals hold well defined yet
conflicting normative views of fair contribution rules related to
efficiency, equality, and equity. In the experiment, in the absence of
punishment no positive contribution norm is observed and all groups
converge towards free-riding. With punishment, strong and stable
differences in contributions emerge across group types and individuals
in different roles. In some cases these differences result from the
emergence of an efficiency norm where all fully contribute. In the cases
where full efficiency is not attained, these differences result from the
enforcement of different relative contribution norms. Hence, our
experimental data show that, even in heterogeneous groups, individuals
can overcome the collective action problem inherent in public good games
by agreeing on and enforcing a contribution norm. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

voluntary contribution mechanism public good game. In our setting, a
standard argument states that a tax should not be effective in raising
contributions, because agents respond by reducing voluntary
contributions by the amount of the tax. Our experimental design focuses
in on this intuition by abstracting away from several potential
confounds. We use a specification for the payoff function in which there
is a dominant strategy for own-earnings maximizing agents, located
interior to and in the upper half of the strategy space. The dominant
strategy ensures that changes in contributions are attributable to the
tax directly, rather than second-order effects due to responses to
out-of-equilibrium play by other agents. The dominant strategy is made
more transparent by the use of a novel graphical decision interface. We
find that individuals robustly choose at or above the own-earnings
dominant strategy level. Even with the controls of the design, crowd-out
is incomplete, but the degree of crowd-out is higher than in previous
studies. Analysis of individual-level decisions provides evidence of
different player types. Behavior of subjects not choosing the dominant
or Pareto-efficient contributions is well-organized by a model of

of existing voluntary behaviour and motivations. In laboratory
experiments, participants often exhibit social preferences such as
altruism, spite, reciprocity and notions of fairness. In contrast,
traditional neoclassical theory assumes that people act rationally in a
way that maximises their self-interest. In environmental markets, social
preferences and self-interest interact. We apply experimental economics
to test the hypothesis that social preferences are not maintained in the
presence of a competitive market institution. In the initial public
goods game, many participants were prepared to make costly voluntary
contributions. However the introduction of the market institution
triggered a `market instinct' in experimental participants. They
abandoned the social preferences they were previously expressing and
became self-interested profit maximisers. This self-interested behaviour
persisted even after the market institution was discontinued. These
findings are important to understanding the role and impact of markets
for environmental policy.}",article,ISI:000283303300008,{3},,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000283303300008},{668WF},{Environ. Resour. Econ.},{23},{0},{19},{24},,,"{Reeson, Andrew/0000-0002-1603-2731

more recognized, and respected individuals in a community. We examine
whether the success of this solicitation ordering in part can be
attributed to the fact that it enables individuals to select
organizations that have a high-status donor base. Assuming that
individuals prefer to associate with individuals of higher social
ranking we use a simple linear model to show that both aggregate
donations and earnings are larger when high-status donors are solicited
first. We investigate the predicted comparative statics using the
experimental laboratory. Inducing a status differential we reverse the
contribution ordering between participants of high and low status.
Consistent with current fundraising practice, we find that low-status
followers are likely to mimic donations by high-status leaders and this
encourages high-status leaders to give. Donations are therefore larger
when individuals of high status give before rather than after those of
low status.}",article,ISI:000279738500006,{4},,{WILEY-BLACKWELL},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000279738500006},{623KN},{J. Public. Econ. Theory.},{30},{1},{54},{44},,,"{Kumru, Cagri/0000-0002-7158-6243}",,"{cs.kumru@unsw.edu.au

less than 5\% of individuals donate to the charitable cause. We present
evidence from two field experiments designed to measure the existence of
transaction costs that inhibit charitable giving in such fundraising
campaigns, and shed light on the nature of such transaction costs. The
experiments are designed in conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera
House. The first mail-out experiment was implemented over two stages
using a within-subject design. We develop a theoretical framework that
makes precise the identifying assumptions under which we can exploit
this two-stage design to measure the following structural parameters
among potential donors: (i) the share of donors who would make a
strictly positive donation in the complete absence of transaction costs
and (ii) the probability that a potential donor has sufficiently low
transactions costs to make a strictly positive donation. Our results
imply response rates to mail-out solicitations would almost double in
the complete absence of transaction costs. The second field experiment
provides more evidence on the nature of transaction costs. We
distinguish between ex ante transaction costs, which prevent the choice
problem from being considered and ex post transaction costs, which
prevent choices being implemented. We find that the likelihood of a
donation being made increases by 26\% in response to even a small
reduction in ex post transaction costs.}",article,ISI:000277221200007,{1},,{BERKELEY ELECTRONIC PRESS},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000277221200007},{590JH},{B E J. Econ. Anal. Policy},{17},{1},{23},{36},,,"{Huck, Steffen/0000-0001-7586-7985}",,"{i.rasul@ucl.ac.uk

player. We provide a model of team production in which the punishment of
shirkers depends on strong reciprocity: the willingness of some team
members to contribute altruistically to a joint project and also to bear
costs in order to discipline fellow members who do not contribute. This
alternative does not require small group size, complex coordinated

List, John A.","{This paper considers how six alternative rebate rules affect voluntary
contributions in a threshold public-good experiment. The rules differ by
(1) whether an individual can receive a proportional rebate of excess
contributions, a winner-takes-all of any excess contributions, or a full
rebate of one's contribution in the event the public good is provided
and excess contributions exist, and (2) whether the probability of
receiving a rebate is proportional to an individual's contribution
relative to total contributions or is a simple uniform probability
distribution set by the number of contributors. The paper adds to the
existing experimental economics literature on threshold public goods by
investigating both aggregate and individual demand revelation under the
winner-take-all and random full-rebate rules. Half of the rules
(proportional rebate, winner-take-all with uniform probability among all
group members, and random full-rebate with uniform probability) provide
total contributions that nearly equal total benefits, while the rest
(winner-take-all with proportional probability, winner-take-all with
uniform probability among contributors only, and random full-rebate with
proportional probability) exceed benefits by over 30\%. Only the
proportional rebate rule is found to achieve both aggregate and
individual demand revelation. Our experimental results have implications
for both fundraisers and valuation practitioners. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

a fundamental issue in all behavioural sciences. In this paper, we
review the experimental evidence on how people solve cooperation
problems. Existing studies show without doubt that direct and indirect
reciprocity are important determinants of successful cooperation. We
also discuss the insights from a large literature on the role of peer
punishment in sustaining cooperation. The experiments demonstrate that
many people are `strong reciprocators' who are willing to cooperate and
punish others even if there are no gains from future cooperation or any
other reputational gains. We document this in new one-shot experiments,
which we conducted in four cities in Russia and Switzerland. Our
cross-cultural approach allows us furthermore to investigate how the
cultural background influences strong reciprocity. Our results show that
culture has a strong influence on positive and in especially strong
negative reciprocity. In particular, we find large cross-cultural
differences in `antisocial punishment' of pro-social cooperators.
Further cross-cultural research and experiments involving different
socio-demographic groups document that the antisocial punishment is much
more widespread than previously assumed. Understanding antisocial
punishment is an important task for future research because antisocial
punishment is a strong inhibitor of cooperation.}",article,ISI:000263434200007,{1518},,{ROYAL SOC},,,{2020-11-06},{Green Published},{ISI:000263434200007},{408KP},{Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B-Biol.

a public good game, comparatively little attention has been paid to a
scenario in which agents have heterogeneous productivities (i.e.
asymmetric impact on the group account). This paper examines the extent
to which sanction works in this scenario by varying marginal per capita
return (MPCR) among group members. Experimental results indicate that in
the absence of sanctions, productivity heterogeneity hampers
cooperation. Allowing punishment in these groups significantly enhances
average contributions of group members, but does not increase welfare.
In groups in which cooperation is highly successful, high-productivity
agents actively punish low-productivity agents in initial periods.
However, conditional on individual contributions, high-productivity
agents receive more punishment, and behave more responsively by raising
their contributions in the next period. The results mirror the reality
in which elites in a society are under higher pressure, since their

systems emerge when information, as the object of exchange, produces a
collective good. When individuals contribute information for a
collective benefit, it can create a group-generalized exchange system
that involves a social dilemma. I argue that two properties of
information, replication and high jointness of supply, are crucial for
understanding the nature of the social dilemma in these exchange
systems. Combined with low-cost contributions, these special features of
information can allow social psychological selective incentives to
significantly encourage cooperation. Experiments were conducted to
examine the independent effects of two social psychological selective
incentives (social approval and observational cooperation) on sharing
behavior in a generalized information exchange system. The results
indicate that observing high levels of cooperative behavior is
beneficial in the short run, but ultimately it only leads to moderately
higher levels of cooperation than when individuals cannot observe
cooperative behavior. On the other hand, when individuals receive either
high or low levels of social approval, it has a very positive,
significant impact on cooperative behavior This research has
implications for real-world generalized information exchange systems
such as those found on the Internet. In addition, the theory and results
in this study can also be extended to public goods that share the

evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but can

the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of individual
differences in understanding and modeling behavior and dynamics in

types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their
beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63\%) of

also compares behavior in an environment in which the imposition of

such campaigns organized through voluntary contributions by firms are
found in the Life Insurance, ( `'It's 1998. You're Dead. What Do You Do

Free-riding is commonly observed in such campaigns when they use the
Simple Voluntary Contribution Mechanism (VCM)- here the budget is
obtained by simply adding up the voluntary contributions of firms. We
propose a new mechanism called the Provision Point VCM that can help
alleviate this free-riding problem. Here, a target budget called the
provision point is announced with the condition that the campaign will
be mounted if and only if the contributions equal or exceed this point,
First, analytically we briefly describe the results for the Simple VCM.
Here, free-riding will always result in equilibrium and the advertising
budget never maximizes industry welfare. Then, we show that if the
provision point is set equal to the Pareto Optimum, the industry welfare
maximizing advertising budget is always a feasible equilibrium outcome
and is a unique outcome in some cases. In fact, we show that no other
Provision Point VCM can lead to welfare maximization.
Then, we present results from experiments using MBA students that test
these findings. Consistent with our analytical results, we show that
when the provision point is set equal to the Pareto Optimum, it
outperforms the Simple VCM in terms of overall contributions and

Examples of particular payoff patterns and thought experiments using a computational simulation demonstrate that withholding cooperation is not always the dominant strategy in the IPD. In the intergroup structure, three conditions differentially reinforce cooperation. When competing groups have equal numbers of cooperators, withholding cooperation is always the dominant strategy just as in the single group structure. In contrast, when one group has more cooperators than the other group, cooperation by its members can dominate withholding cooperation by members of the other group. Thus, the relative advantage of one group over another increases the payoff for cooperation in some configurations of the IPD over the payoff in the PD. Relative payoff is thus an untheorized variable motivating cooperation in the IPD.

Prisoner's Dilemmas are situations where people must make decisions on present and long-term consequences. Game theorists utilize games, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, to model matters of public policy and law, and mathematically solve those games to determine how a decision should be made. However, laboratory experiments have shown that players often play these games based on non-rational models of logic. The author conducted an extensive review of the literature and chose four psychological paradigms relevant for laboratory-conducted Prisoner's Dilemma games: nonconscious goal activation, relative risk aversion, task appraisals, and Machiavellianism. All four paradigms are directly related to decision-making when emotion, uncertainty, personality, or cognitive capabilities are factors. 97 participants completed a nonconscious goal activation task, and then played a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game. Players also completed a relative risk aversion choice task, a Machiavellianism scale, task appraisal questions, and demographic questions. The researcher coded the players' action sets (game choices) into nine separate domains for analysis. The nonconscious goal activation task had a significant effect on the length of games, number of cooperative choices, strategies played, new game attempts, and total points earned. Machiavellianism was a significant predictor of length of games, number of cooperative choices, initial and actual strategy choices, propensities to reset the game, and earned points. Risk aversion was a significant predictor of strategy adherence. Lastly, task appraisals were significant predictors of three domains, all related to the propensity of the player to reset a game after ending it. All four psychological paradigms were found to be relevant to decision-making in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game. Findings from this study have established the framework for further research into the effects of goals, personalities, risk propensities, and cognitive task appraisal for consideration when utilizing Prisoner's Dilemma games to develop and analyze psychological aspects of public policy and law. Implications of the experiment and suggestions for further research conclude the dissertation.

Y.","We propose a model to measure risk in a prisoner’s dilemma based on Coombs’ (1973) re‐parameterization of the game as an individual risk decision‐making task that chooses between a gamble of cooperation and another gamble of defection. Specifically, we propose an index, r, to represent the risk associated with cooperation relative to defection. In conjunction with Rapoport’s (1967) index of cooperation (K), our formulation of risk allows us to construct games that vary in risk (as indexed by r) while controlling for cooperativeness (as indexed by K). Following utility analysis that models risk seeking as a convex utility function and risk averse as a concave function, we predict that riskseeking people cooperate more in games that the cooperation choice is more risky, whereas risk‐averse people cooperate more in games that the cooperation choice is less risky. In the three studies that we varied game parameters, used different measures of risk orientation and prosocial orientation and used different experimental procedures, we found robust results supporting our predictions. Theoretical analysis of our formulation further suggests that risk and cooperativeness of a prisoner’s dilemma game is not entirely independent.

The results from three studies supported the notion that cooperativeness and competitiveness are two independent dimensions, challenging the traditional view that they are two ends of a single continuum. First, confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a two-factor structure fit the data significantly better than a one-factor structure. Moreover, cooperativeness and competitiveness were either not significantly correlated (Studies 1 and 3) or only moderately positively correlated (Study 2). Second, cooperativeness and competitiveness were differentially associated with Schwartz's Personal Values. These results further supported the idea that cooperativeness and competitiveness are two distinct constructs. Specifically, the individuals who were highly cooperative emphasized self-transcendent values (i.e., universalism and benevolence) more, whereas the individuals who were highly competitive emphasized self-enhancement values (i.e., power and achievement) more. Finally, the CCPS, which adheres to the trait perspective of personality, was found to be a useful supplement to more prevalent social motive measures (i.e., social value orientation) in predicting cooperative behaviors. Specifically, in Study 2, when social value orientation was controlled for, the CCPS significantly predicted cooperative behaviors in a public goods dilemma (individuals who score higher on cooperativeness scale contributed more to the public goods). In Study 3, when social value orientation was controlled for, the CCPS significantly predicted cooperative behaviors in commons dilemmas (individuals who score higher on cooperativeness scale requested fewer resources from the common resource pool). The practical implications of the CCPS in conflict resolution, as well as in recruitment and selection settings, are discussed.

ZD strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a linear relationship between her score and her opponent’s score, and thus to achieve an unusual degree of control over both players’ long-term payoffs. Although originally conceived in the context of classical two-player game theory, ZD strategies also have consequences in evolving populations of players. Here, we explore the evolutionary prospects for ZD strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD). Several recent studies have focused on the evolution of 'extortion strategies,' a subset of ZD strategies, and have found them to be unsuccessful in populations. Nevertheless, we identify a different subset of ZD strategies, called 'generous ZD strategies,' that forgive defecting opponents but nonetheless dominate in evolving populations. For all but the smallest population sizes, generous ZD strategies are not only robust to being replaced by other strategies but can selectively replace any noncooperative ZD strategy. Generous strategies can be generalized beyond the space of ZD strategies, and they remain robust to invasion. When evolution occurs on the full set of all IPD strategies, selection disproportionately favors these generous strategies. In some regimes, generous strategies outperform even the most successful of the well-known IPD strategies, including win-stay-lose-shift.

We find that the termination rules do not significantly affect average cooperation rates.

However, the termination rules may influence cooperation over time and end-game behavior. Further, the (expected) length of the game significantly increases cooperation rates.

The PDG captures three key qualities that are at the heart of paranoia—it is interpersonal, it concerns threat, and it concerns the perception of others' intentions towards the self. Study 1 (n = 175) found that state paranoia was positively associated with selection of the competitive PDG choice. Study 2 (n = 111) found that this association was significant only when participants believed they were playing the PDG against another person, and not when playing against a computer.

In Study 3 (n = 152), we assessed both trait and state paranoia, and differentiated between distrust- and greed-based competition. Both trait and state paranoia were positively associated with distrust-based competition (but not with greed-based competition).

Results showed that altruistic contributions in the games were not significantly larger in the attractive observer group than in the non-attractive observer group. Exploratory analyses did reveal, however, that amongst participants with an attractive observer only, dispositional generosity had a strongly positive effect on altruism while dispositional dominance had a negative effect on altruism.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) is a well-known model in game theory that illustrates the paradoxical disposition of interaction between two individuals with opposing interests, and may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ASP in early childhood. In this study, we investigated the cognitive characteristics of ASP by using a modified PD game. The subjects were 29 individuals with ASP and 28 age- and IQ-matched controls. In the PD game, each of two players has two cards: card 1 represents cooperation and card 2 betrayal. The score each player obtains is decided according to a 2 x 2 payoff matrix and depends on the combination of their selections. The P-score ('P' for punishment) is defined as the score that is given when they both select betrayal. Comparing the two groups, the mean P-score at the end of the game and the mean total score were significantly higher in the ASP group, while the rate of selection of cooperative choice in both groups did not differ significantly. The classification of the shape of the graph according to fluctuation of the P-score revealed that in the ASP group only 2 cases (6.9%) showed continuous decrease of P-score compared to 8 control cases (28.6%) demonstrating similar results. However, the reasons were thought to be different: ASP subjects presumably selected card 2 because of a preference for the number itself, whereas control subjects preferentially chose this card to enhance their chance of winning the competition. It is often difficult to diagnose ASP in the young especially when they lack the distinctive clinical features of ASD in early childhood. Given the limited number of objective tools to evaluate the cognitive characteristics of ASP subjects, the PD game might be a useful diagnostic support tool for ASP.

We have performed the largest experiments to date with humans playing a spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma on a lattice and a scale-free network (1,229 subjects). We observed that the level of cooperation reached in both networks is the same, comparable with the level of cooperation of smaller networks or unstructured populations. We have also found that subjects respond to the cooperation that they observe in a reciprocal manner, being more likely to cooperate if, in the previous round, many of their neighbors and themselves did so, which implies that humans do not consider neighbors’ payoffs when making their decisions in this dilemma but only their actions.

Aggression occurring in these couples is often bidirectional, highly impacted by situational stressors, and perpetrated by both males and females at relatively equal rates. Most importantly, dating aggression occurs within a developmental context when individuals are attempting to balance autonomy and intimacy within their relationships. However, little is known about conflict management within dating couples or if conflict management processes differ substantially for aggressive and nonaggressive dating couples. Although there has been extensive research in marital processes in conflict, only recently have researchers argued the need for conflict management of young, dating couples to be studied in a dynamic way (Capaldi, Kim, & Shortt, 2007). For this study, a computer administered version of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game was used as a tool for elicitation and observation of conflict behavior of young, dating couples. Specific in-game responding including negative escalation (termed defection spirals), cooperation, and repair were examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition to the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, participants completed questionnaires regarding personal history, current mood, and information on their dating relationship. A cross-sectional sample of college couples (N = 40 couples) was used and group membership (either aggressive or non-aggressive) was determined by endorsement of items on the Revised Conflict Tactic Scales (Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman, 1996). Findings suggest aggressive and non-aggressive couples’ perceptions and approach to the Prisoner’s Dilemma game differed significantly. Primary hypotheses regarding differences between groups on the use of defection, cooperation, and repair over time (Group x Time interactions) were not supported by the data. However, aggressive and non-aggressive couples differed significantly on their use of defection and cooperation responses. For example, aggressive couples used more defection responses throughout the Prisoner’s Dilemma game while non-aggressive couples used more cooperative responses. Descriptive analysis of game patterns by group indicated differing patterns for aggressive and non-aggressive couples. In addition, exploratory hypotheses examining the relationship between the Prisoner’s Dilemma game and aggressiveness towards one’s partner were significant, thus, adding to the literature in this area. Implications of these findings and future research are discussed.

However, despite a growing number of empirical findings reported in the literature, the results are still inconclusive about the mechanism for the social effects of emotion. This dissertation studies how emotion displays in computers impact people's decision-making and proposes a mechanism for such effects based on appraisal theories of emotion. In appraisal theories, emotion displays arise from cognitive appraisal of events with respect to one's goals (e.g., is this event congruent with my goals? Who is responsible for this event?). According to the pattern of appraisals that occurs, different emotions are experienced and displayed. Since displays reflect the agent's intentions through the appraisal process, we argue people infer, from emotion displays, how computer agents are appraising the ongoing interaction and, from this information, make inferences about the agents' intentions. We refer to this theory as reverse appraisal. To support it, several empirical studies are presented where participants engage in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with virtual agents that, though following the same strategy to choose their actions, display emotions in the face that are consistent with either cooperative or competitive goals. The results confirm that emotion displays impact people's decision making and people cooperate more with cooperative agents. Consistent with reverse appraisal's prediction that what is critical for the effects is not the emotion but the underlying appraisals, the results also show that the same display (e.g., a smile) can lead to opposite effects on cooperation depending on the context in which it is shown. A final study shows that people can successfully retrieve, from emotion displays, information about how agents are appraising the ongoing interaction; moreover, these perceptions of appraisal are shown to mediate the effect of emotion displays on perceptions of the agents' likelihood of cooperation. Having established the theoretical foundations of reverse appraisal, the dissertation presents several computational models of decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma. These models were developed by applying statistical and machine learning techniques on the data collected in the studies. Experimental results show that, as expected, computer models can better replicate human behavior in the original studies if they take into consideration the counterpart's appraisals and emotion displays. In addition, the dissertation also contributes a platform for creating realistic embodied agents that can display emotion. This platform was used in all studies to implement the experimental manipulations and can be used as a research tool to study human-agent and human-human interaction. Finally, the dissertation discusses the implications of reverse appraisal and the reported social effects of emotion for human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, decision and emotion theory.

They describe situations where two players interact repeatedly and have the ability to use conditional strategies that depend on the outcome of previous interactions, thus allowing for reciprocation. Recently, a new class of strategies has been proposed, so-called 'zero-determinant' strategies. These strategies enforce a fixed linear relationship between one’s own payoff and that of the other player. A subset of those strategies allows 'extortioners' to ensure that any increase in one player’s own payoff exceeds that of the other player by a fixed percentage. Here, we analyze the evolutionary performance of this new class of strategies. We show that in reasonably large populations, they can act as catalysts for the evolution of cooperation, similar to tit-for-tat, but that they are not the stable outcome of natural selection. In very small populations, however, extortioners hold their ground. Extortion strategies do particularly well in coevolutionary arms races between two distinct populations. Significantly, they benefit the population that evolves at the slower rate, an example of the so-called 'Red King' effect. This may affect the evolution of interactions between host species and their endosymbionts.

However, cooperation can be facilitated by introducing reputational incentives. Through indirect reciprocity, people who cooperate in a social dilemma are more likely to receive cooperative acts from others. Another mechanism that enhances group cooperation is reputation-based partner choice, or competitive altruism. According to this framework, cooperators benefit via increased access to cooperative partners. Our study compared the effectiveness of indirect reciprocity and competitive altruism in re-establishing cooperation after the typical decline found during repeated public goods games. Twenty groups of four participants first played a series of public goods games, which confirmed the expected decline. Subsequently, public goods games were alternated with either indirect reciprocity games (in which participants had an opportunity to give to another individual from whom they would never receive a direct return) or competitive altruism games (in which they could choose partners for directly reciprocal interactions). We found that public goods game contributions increased when interspersed with competitive altruism games; they were also higher than in public goods games interspersed with indirect reciprocity games. Investing in reputation by increasing contributions to public goods was a profitable strategy in that it increased returns in subsequent competitive altruism and indirect reciprocity games. There was also some evidence that these returns were greater under competitive altruism than indirect reciprocity. Our findings indicate that strategic reputation building through competitive altruism provides an effective alternative to indirect reciprocity as a means for restoring cooperation in social dilemmas.

Generally, individuals do better than non-cooperative groups, regardless of the type of conflict, and more often than not it is better to have a non-cooperative group rather than an individual as an opponent.

Research has uncovered several key strategies for encouraging maintenance of these resources, however, one area that remains understudied is the effect various emotions may have on cooperation. Furthermore, it is important to consider the specific type of desired behavior: reduction of consumption of a shared resource, or increased contribution to a shared resource. The current study takes a step in this direction, examining the effects of two self-conscious emotions, guilt and pride, on behavior in two different kinds of social dilemmas. Guilt, a prosocial emotion that has been described as a 'behavioral interrupt mechanism,' is predicted to increase cooperation in both a social trap game and a public goods dilemma game. However, its effects should be strongest in the social trap game, in which the desired behavior is reduced consumption. Pride, an emotion that is conceptually related to the constructs of status and power, is predicted to motivate action in both domains, by increasing both consumption in the social trap game and contribution in the public goods dilemma game. Results partially support these predictions: Whereas guilt and pride both had the predicted effects on consumption in the social trap game, neither had a significant effect on contribution in the public goods dilemma game. Individual differences are examined, as are the results of a Game Feedback Sheet, which yielded insight as to how participants understood the rules of the games, and why they chose the strategies they did. Results support the idea that emotions represent a potentially fruitful avenue of research in social dilemma cooperation, and possible future directions for this research are discussed.

If benefits are shared equally, individual contributions readily become altruistic, and hence, a social dilemma arises in which group interests and individual interests oppose each other. However, contributions to public goods can be self‐serving if each investor gains a disproportionate benefit from its own contribution. This scenario may hold for our study system, the interactions of shoaling‐unrelated scalefin anthias Pseudanthias squamipinnis and the ectoparasitic blenny Plagiotremus tapeinosoma. The blenny bites off pieces of skin, mucus and scales from anthias that in return may chase the blenny. Chasing the blenny represents a public good as it makes the parasite change victim species for its next attack. Laboratory experiments using artificial Plexiglas hosts suggest that one reason why individuals contribute to the public good is that the blenny may specialise on non‐punishing ‘free‐riders’. Here, we investigated how far a spatial structure within the shoal and limited space use by the blenny may contribute to punishment being self‐serving. Field observation reveals that anthias indeed live in spatially structured groups and that blennies have preferred areas for attacks. Thus, some anthias individuals are consistently more exposed to blennies than others and hence may gain disproportional benefits from their punishment. In conclusion, spatial structure may contribute to the maintenance of punishment in blenny–anthias interactions even when groups are large.

In the first chapter, we use game theory and experimental economics approaches to analyze the relationships between corporate culture and the persistent performance differences among seemingly similar enterprises. First, we show that competition leads to higher minimum effort levels in the minimum effort coordination game. Furthermore, we show that organizations with better coordination also lead to higher rates of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game. This supports the theory that the high-efficiency culture developed in coordination games act as a focal point for the outcome of subsequent prisoner's dilemma game. In turn, we argue that these endogenous features of culture developed from coordination and cooperation can help explain the persistent performance differences. In the second chapter, using a computational testbed, we theoretically predict and experimentally show that in the minimum effort coordination game, as the cost of effort increases: (1) the game converges to lower effort levels, (2) convergence speed increases, and (3) average payoff is not monotonically decreasing. In fact, the average profit is an U-shaped curve as a function of cost. Therefore, contrary to the intuition, one can obtain a higher average profit by increasing the cost of effort. In the last chapter, we investigate a well-known paradox in finance. The equity market home bias occurs when the investors over-invest in their home country assets. The equity market home bias is a paradox because the investors are not hedging their risk optimally. Even with unrealistic levels of risk aversion, the equity market home bias cannot be explained using the standard mean-variance model. We propose ambiguity aversion to be the behavioral explanation. We design six experiments using real-world assets and derivatives to show the relationship between ambiguity aversion and home bias. We tested for ambiguity aversion by showing that the investor's subjective probability is sub-additive. The result from the experiment provides support for the assertion that ambiguity aversion is related to the equity market home bias paradox.

The written debriefing report gave all students an opportunity to reflect, analyze, and evaluate their experience in depth. The use of two facilitators allows one to facilitate while the other observes and rests, makes 2 points of view available for the debriefing, and offers a model for resolving minor disagreements between them. Trust among students increased across the weekend as evidenced by an increase in cooperative choices and estimates of the likelihood that others would cooperate in the TAKE-A-CHANCE game, a version of PRISONER’S DILEMMA.

This dissertation examines how trust (not mere liking) is attained, maintained, and regained between Black and White individuals as a function of closeness (inclusion of other in the self) in friendship contexts. Trust placed in outgroup (vs. same-race) friends is hypothesized to be shallower, asymmetric, and more vulnerable to disruption. In Study 1, a dyadic investigation over time, White and Black students who described interracial (vs. same-race) friendships initially reported less trust, closeness, stimulating companionship, reliable alliance, self-disclosure, perceived other disclosure, perceived help/support, and perceived understanding, followed by less perceived other disclosure and less contact a year later. Participants' initial trust and closeness (not liking) mediated these effects. Initial trust predicted fewer subsequent friend betrayals and greater closeness to an outgroup friend's racial group one year later. In Studies 2a and 2b, White and Black participants imagined a White or Black friend engaging in relational behaviors over time, sometimes including a betrayal. Black participants reported less cultural trust (not liking) after imagining a betrayal by a White (vs. Black) friend. No cultural trust gap emerged for White participants, or for Black participants who were high in subjective closeness or not betrayed. In Study 3, White and Black strangers completed either control or friendship-inducing closeness tasks in dyads before a prisoner's dilemma game that sometimes simulated a partner defection. After partner defections, Black participants reported lower trust (not liking) for White than Black partners, an effect partially mediated by negative other-directed affect, in the control condition. Black participants in the closeness condition and no-betrayal condition trusted White and Black partners equally, as did White participants. These studies (a) suggest that Black individuals trust ingroup more than outgroup individuals, particularly after betrayals, except when subjective closeness is high, and (b) underscore the centrality of trust (not liking) and closeness for successful interracial friendships.

The fight goes back and forth, giving the neighbours a hard time. These kind of reciprocal punishments are known as vendettas and they are a cross-cultural phenomenon. In evolutionary biology, punishment is seen as a mechanism for maintaining cooperative behaviour. However, this notion of punishment excludes vendettas. Vendettas pose a special kind of evolutionary problem: they incur high costs on individuals, i.e. costs of punishing and costs of being punished, without any benefits. Theoretically speaking, punishment should be rare in dyadic relationships and vendettas would not evolve under natural selection. In contrast, punishment is assumed to be more efficient in group environments which then can pave the way for vendettas. Accordingly, we found that under the experimental conditions of a prisoner’s dilemma game, human participants punished only rarely and vendettas are scarce. In contrast, we found that participants retaliated frequently in the group environment of a public goods game. They even engaged in cost-intense vendettas (i.e. continuous retaliation), especially when the first punishment was unjustified or ambiguous. Here, punishment was mainly targeted at defectors in the beginning, but provocations led to mushrooming of counter-punishments. Despite the counter-punishing behaviour, participants were able to enhance cooperation levels in the public goods game. Few participants even seemed to anticipate the outbreak of costly vendettas and delayed their punishment to the last possible moment. Overall, our results highlight the importance of different social environments while studying punishment as a cooperation-enhancing mechanism.

An actual partner can change its behavior. In one scenario participants actually interacted with a human partner, in another scenario their partner was either a mostly cooperating computer agent or a mostly defecting computer agent. Three experiments were performed. The result suggested that the participants’ selection behavior was largely influenced by the instruction given about the partner by the experimenter and not influenced by the partner’s actual behavior. The analysis of the participants’ impressions of the partner showed that the effect of instruction about the partner disappeared. Individual likeability for a partner was very influenced by the partner’s behavior; as the participants incurred more defect actions from the partner, individual likeability for the partner decreased. On the other hand, social likeability for a partner was not so influenced by the partner’s behavior, but rather related to the participants’ own behavior. The participants who made more defect actions rated their partner’s social likeability lower.

To test this explanation, we compared participants whose decisions did not influence the earnings of other participants, and who therefore had no opportunity for altruistic rationalization of competitiveness, with participants whose decisions did influence the earnings of other participants, and who therefore did have an opportunity for altruistic rationalization. Competition in a prisoner’s dilemma game was greater when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present, but this effect was significant only for participants who were low in dispositional proneness to guilt, a trait that motivates prosocial behavior. In other words, we found that dispositionally selfish individuals were most likely to become more competitive when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present.

One theory of how shared social norms evolve is that they arise from mutually rewarding conventions which, through repeated execution, acquire a normative value that sustains social cohesion even when individual self-interest is not served. The authors report an fMRI study of a 2-player coordination game in which players must coordinate on an arbitrary convention (a left or right button press) to obtain monetary rewards. Once this convention has been established, one of the participants is incentivized to deviate from the equilibrium with the offer of extra reward. During the period prior to decisions to violate the convention, activity was observed in regions associated with reward processing, such as the midbrain, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex. Activations in advance of decisions to continue coordinating included the amygdala and anterior insula–inferior frontal gyrus.

If large-scale cooperation sustained by the punishment of defectors has evolved through the mechanism of cultural group selection, two implications regarding costly punishment follow: (1) that people are more willing to punish defecting group members in a situation of intergroup competition than in a single-group social dilemma game and (2) that levels of 'perverse' punishment of cooperators are not affected by intergroup competition. We find confirmation for these hypotheses. However, we find that the effect of intergroup competition on the punishment of defectors is fully explained by the stronger conditionality of punishment on expected punishment levels in the competition condition.

Rarely are both dilemmas examined simultaneously, a potential oversight considering research on decision-making implicates give-and-take differences. In this paper, we propose that an important part of cooperating in different social dilemmas involves emotionally guided goals, termed emotivations. For example, emotivations include: in anger, wanting to antagonize others; in disgust, wanting to expel objects and avoid taking anything new; and in sadness, wanting to change one’s situation.

We find that, for certain parameter constellations, a social institution, prescribing prosocial behavior and thus solving the second-order dilemma, can emerge from a population of selfish players.

A leading explanation of cooperation is the mechanism of altruistic punishment, where individuals pay to punish others but receive no material benefit in return. Experiments have shown such punishment can induce cooperative outcomes in social dilemmas, though sometimes at the cost of reduced social welfare. However, experiments typically examine the effects of punishing low contributors without allowing others in the environment to respond. Thus, the full ramifications of punishment may not be well understood. Here, I use evolutionary simulations of agents playing a continuous prisoners dilemma to study behavior subsequent to an act of punishment, and how that subsequent behavior affects the efficiency of payoffs. Different network configurations are used to better understand the relative effects of social structure and individual strategies. Results show that when agents can either retaliate against their punisher, or punish those who ignore cheaters, the cooperative effects of punishment are reduced or eliminated. The magnitude of this effect is dependent on the density of the network in which the population is embedded. Overall, results suggest that a better understanding of the aftereffects of punishment is needed to assess the relationship between punishment and cooperative outcomes.

However, few studies have directly examined the effects of gratitude on cooperation, particularly, in a social dilemma context. Therefore, the current research aims at investigating the impact of gratitude on cooperative behaviors in a public good game. Traditional methodology in emotion research induces emotions exogenously, i.e. with the use of recall procedures, imagination of scenarios or video clips. Here, a new methodology is introduced where the emotion of gratitude is induced endogenously, within a public good game. Using this new induction procedure, it was found that endogenous gratitude motivated cooperative behaviors. In addition, it was also of interest to investigate the potential influences of contextual factors on the gratitude-cooperation linkage. Studies were systematically conducted to examine three contextual variables, namely; human contact through handshaking, threat of exclusion, and perspective-taking through empathy induction. Results across the four studies suggest that the emotion of gratitude acts as a motivator for cooperative behaviors in the presence of an exclusion option and empathy induction.

According to an interdependence perspective, trust becomes an especially important determinant of behavior in situations involving larger, compared to smaller, degrees of conflicting interests. To examine this perspective, we conducted a meta-analysis involving 212 effect sizes on the relation between trust (both state and dispositional trust in others) and cooperation in social dilemmas—situations that involve varying degrees of conflict between self-interest and collective interest. Results revealed that the positive relation between trust and cooperation is stronger when there is a larger, compared to smaller, degree of conflict. We also examined several other possible moderators of the relation between trust and cooperation. The relation between trust and cooperation was stronger during individual, compared to intergroup, interactions but did not vary as a function of the situation being either a one-shot or repeated interaction. We also find differences across countries in the extent that people condition their own cooperation based on their trust in others. We discuss how the results support an emerging consensus about trust being limited to situations of conflict and address some theoretical and societal implications for our understanding of how and why trust is so important to social interactions and relationships.

We argue and demonstrate that in social dilemmas third-parties use the equality rule as a strict benchmark to determine punishments (Study 1) as well as rewards (Study 2), but only under environmental certainty. Under environmental uncertainty, third-parties do not apply such a strict benchmark to distinguish cooperators from defectors. Instead, they appear to use the following rule: the more an individual group member has cooperated the less he/she should be punished (Study 1) and the more he/she should be rewarded (Study 2). As such, these findings are the first to demonstrate that third-party sanctioning decisions are moderated by environmental uncertainty.

Krueger, Theresa E. DiDonato & David Freestone (see record [rid]2012-07662-001[/rid]). The social projection theory presented by the authors has a sound computational structure, its underlying reasoning process seems to be unnecessary and result in conflicting choices. In fact, it is the shift from conditioning behavior on the probability of cooperation to conditioning behavior on the probability of similarity that provides a new normative theory and a descriptive model of behavior. Mixing the probability of similarity with the probability of cooperation in the same model seems to annul the progress provided by the former. Of course, one cannot exclude the possibility that under some constraints some individuals will reason sequentially about the single-step PD game, with the player making the first move and the opponent either reciprocating or deviating. One also cannot deny the existence of individuals who are completely ignorant regarding their opponents and therefore make use of their own disposition as a proxy for their opponent's choice. To construct an opponent whose similarity level can be portrayed by a precise probability while excluding any form of reciprocity, participants were placed in front of a mirror that reflected their own image. The present manuscript examined social projection theory by comparing its underlying cognitive process and computational structure with Subjective Expected Relative Similarity.

According to the logic of appropriateness, decision changes result from changes in answer to the question, 'what does a person like me do in a situation like this?' In two studies, transient group affiliation is systematically manipulated to test its influence on the appropriateness question both in the present and future. Novel methodologies (videotaping group interactions to obtain observed levels of group affiliation, implicit measures of social concept activation and aspect listing protocols) were used to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the influence of group affiliation. Increases in group affiliation are accompanied by increases in the accessibility of social constructs, higher levels of cooperation, personal satisfaction and trust in one’s group. Similar patterns are observed for decisions in the present and future. There is an order effect observed with decisions to cooperate in the future carrying over to subsequent decisions to cooperate in the present, but a decision to initially cooperate in the present does not translate as strongly to a decision to cooperate in the future. This is in part because a more analytical approach is used for decisions pertaining to the future, while decisions in the present tend to be more affect-based.

They predicted that contribution behavior would have opposite effects on 2 forms of status—prestige and dominance—depending on its consequences for the self, in-group and out-group members. When the only way to benefit in-group members was by harming out-group members (Study 1), contributions increased prestige and decreased dominance, compared with free-riding. Adding the option of benefitting in-group members without harming out-group members (Study 2) decreased the prestige and increased the dominance of those who chose to benefit in-group members via intergroup competition. Finally, sharing resources with both in-group and out-group members decreased perceptions of both prestige and dominance, compared with sharing them with in-group members only (Study 3). Prestige and dominance differentially mediated the effects of contribution behavior on leader election, exclusion from the group, and choices of a group representative for an intergroup competition. Taken together, these findings show that the well-established relationship between contribution and status is moderated by both the intergroup context and the conceptualization of status.

Previous studies suggest that allowing intra-team communication increases the team discontinuity effect because having communication among team members strengthens in-group favoritism norms. Drawing on the Information Sampling Theory (Stasser, 1989) and Social Decision Making Theory (Kerr, 2001), I argue that communication among team members sways groups to compete more because members are more likely to focus on sharing more popular opinions to compete than opinions to cooperate. Accordingly, I propose that having team discussion interventions that facilitates a discussion of cooperative opinions will increase team decisions to cooperate. Specifically, I hypothesized that making teams discuss pros and cons of both cooperative and competitive decisions will make teams become more cooperative. In addition, I proposed that having cooperative individuals to speak first during team discussion will increase team decisions to cooperate. Participants played a Prisoner's Dilemma Game for six trials as an individual or a three-person team. In individual conditions, individuals played PDGs individually. In the control team condition, teams played the PDGs and each trial allowed for two minutes of team discussion. In the balanced team condition, teams played PDGs and team members discussed using a decision guideline. In the cooperative primacy condition, the most cooperative team members were given opportunity to speak first during team discussion for two minutes for each trial. Teams competed more than individuals thereby replicating the group discontinuity effect. Consistent with our prediction, teams with balanced team discussion made more cooperative choices than teams in the control condition. Teams with cooperative primacy made the most cooperative choices in the first two trials but their cooperation rates decreased over time. These results suggest that having team discussion interventions can potentially allow teams to make more cooperative choices and decrease the discontinuity effect. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Four sets of studies are presented to accomplish this task. In Studies 1a-c, three student samples are used to develop and validate the student SOII using existing measures within the psychological literature, in a traditional scale validation collection of studies. In Study 2, the SOII is assessed for its ability to detect situational influence via a priming task in which participants receive either primes of individualistic or collectivistic values as an instantiation of the accessibility of self-construals of self- and other-interest. In Studies 3a-c, the SOII is assessed for its ability to predict behavior: participants' donation behavior is shown to depend on whether self-interest or other-interest self-construal is accessible; perseverance in a mental rotation task is predicted by self-interest self-construal when incentivized by benefits to the self and other-interest self-construal when incentivized by benefits to the other; and cooperative behavior in a prisoner's dilemma depends on both self- and other-interest self-construals when both are made accessible. Finally, in Studies 4a & b, the adult version of the SOII is validated and used to show that participants' age predicts differences in the relationships between self-construals, and the relationship between age and positive relationship between self- and other-interest predicts the development of generativity (as opposed to stagnation), the primary developmental task of midlife.

One factor that may contribute to individual differences in cooperation is a key gene within the oxytocin (OT) system, the OT reception gene (OXTR). In this article, we aim to bridge the gap between the OXTR gene and cooperation by using an endophenotype approach. We present evidence that the association between the OXTR gene and cooperation may in part be due to how the OXTR gene affects brain systems involved in emotion recognition, empathy/theory of mind, social communication and social reward seeking. There is evidence that the OXTR gene is associated with the functional anatomy of the amygdala, visual cortex (VC), anterior cingulate and superior temporal gyrus (STG). However, it is currently unknown how the OXTR gene may be linked to the functional anatomy of other relevant brain regions that include the fusiform gyrus (FG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc).

In Study 1 and 2 we documented that more spiritual individuals experience and show greater compassion. The link between religiosity and compassion was no longer significant after controlling for the impact of spirituality. Compassion has the capacity to motivate people to transcend selfish motives and act altruistically toward strangers. Therefore, we reasoned that spirituality (but not religiosity) would predict altruistic behavior and that compassion would help explain this link. Indeed, in Studies 3, 4, and 5 we found that more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically in economic choice and decision-making tasks, and that the tendency of spiritual individuals to feel greater compassion mediated the spirituality-to-altruism relationship. In contrast, more religious participants did not consistently feel more compassion nor behave more altruistically. Moreover, in Studies 3 and 4 we found that the broader traits of Agreeableness, Openness, and Extraversion did not help explain why more spiritual individuals behaved more altruistically.

The authors studied the effects of discounting and strategic reciprocity on cooperation in 16 captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata). The results demonstrate an interaction between discounting and reciprocity. Blue jays show high stable levels of cooperation in treatments with reduced discounting when their opponent reciprocates, but their levels of cooperation decline in all other treatment combinations.

In a 100-trial iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), with instructions to simulate wartime interactions, competition/aggression was defined as 'attacking the opponent', and 'waiting for troop reinforcements' was the noncompetitive alternative response. Prior to play, 92 university students completed the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory. Ss were then paired to play the IPD against partners of similar or dissimilar TA levels. At postplay, the State Anger scale was readministered. Results showed significant preplay to postplay increases in state anger, with greater increases shown by high TA players. Ss in the high TA group made more competitive/attack responses, and they were more likely to do so when paired with a high TA partner. As a result of the high level of competitive/aggressive play, both groups ended with a negative troop count. TA as a general personality temperament was predictive of state anger, competitive/attack responses, and the number of trials before a retaliation was made. It is concluded that TA, especially TA/ temperament, and anger control difficulties may be toxic personality factors in decision making and competitive behavior.

Following the reasoning that differences between social dilemmas involving more than two players and PDG are only differences of degree, some researchers have attempted to apply TFT in multi-player social dilemmas. The manner in which these experimenters have applied the reciprocity of TFT has been to have a number of 'dummy players' (DP's) in the social dilemma applying a straightforward TFT strategy against one real player. Results of these studies suggest that TFT can effectively increase cooperation in one player when more than half of the DP's are applying a TFT strategy against him/her. The present studies propose a different and more realistic manner of applying a reciprocal strategy in social dilemmas. In a 5-person prisoner's dilemma game (NPG), each person played against 4 DP's in which the distribution of DP choices reciprocated the player's choices. Simply put, the number of DP's cooperating on a given trial was a reflection of the player's choices on previous trials; many cooperations led many DP's to cooperate and many defections led many DP's to defect. Comparison of data from this modified TFT condition versus that from a condition in which the distribution of DP's choices was randomly determined on each trial (RAN) suggests that this reciprocal strategy did promote cooperation in many players. About half of the players exclusively cooperated in this condition, while almost all players in the RAN condition exclusively defected. A second exposure to the TFT condition improved level of cooperation further, though there still remained some players that did not cooperate. A follow-up experiment suggests that this improvement in level of cooperation during a second exposure to TFT is a result of the combined effects of the stop in play and the resetting of the DP distribution. Data from the RAN condition, where players had no effect on the future choices of DP's, suggest that players were themselves applying some version of reciprocity. Players were more likely to cooperate following a trial in which many DP's cooperated, and this declined within a session as the player learned the ineffectiveness of such a strategy. A weakness of TFT as a strategy is discussed as a possible explanation for the number of players who continued to exclusively defect in the TFT condition.

Conversely, cooperation enhances group gains, but only if adopted by all. The payoff structure of the PD ensures that for any probability of opponent cooperation, defection will remain the dominating strategy. Classic game theory implicitly assumes that the perceived probability of an opponent's cooperation is independent of the player's own intended choice. In contrast, the present research suggests that individuals may sequentially evaluate the possible outcomes for each choice. When predicting opponent behavior, individuals may anchor predictions about their opponent on their own behavior. Cooperation would then be the optimal strategy in the PD, since payoffs to the individual and group are higher for mutual cooperation than for mutual defection. In Studies 1-3, individual differences in projection were used to predict PD behavior, but were not good predictors. In Study 4, participants were explicitly provided with reciprocity information. In this study, cooperation increased monotonically with the probability of matching response from an opponent. In Study 5, participants were provided with information about the probability of opponent cooperation, information independent of participant choice. Here, cooperation was uniformly low. In Study 6, individuals played the PD against an ingroup or outgroup member. Although projection varied with group status, cooperation did not, thereby eliminating projection as a possible mediator of the relationship between group status and cooperation. Overall, explicit manipulations of probability values consistent with projection (i.e., information about opponent reciprocation of one's response) were more effective in eliciting cooperation than more implicit manipulations. In Studies 2-6, increases in the difference in payoff between mutual cooperation and mutual defection were also shown to increase cooperation.

Because Prisoner's Dilemma contains both fear and greed, the theories outlined in this article predict no sex differences in cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemma. A series of hypotheses about the conditions under which sex affects cooperation are proposed and tested against the results of two new studies.

Moreover, TFT's potency in inducing cooperation from competitors was quite strong, as it was able to induce almost the same level of cooperation from competitors as from cooperators. The 3 reciprocal strategies were similar in their effectiveness for inducing cooperation from cooperators.

This was true whether moods were manipulated by films (Studies 1 and 2) or music (Study 4) or were assessed dispositionally (Study 3); whether specific or global goals were manipulated (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or were assessed dispositionally (Study 2); and whether participants' actions were tested in a resource dilemma (Studies 1, 2, and 4) or prisoner's dilemma game (Study 3). In 3 studies, bad moods led to more competition (less cooperation) with competitive goals in mind but to more cooperation (less competition) with cooperative goals in mind. A 4th study reversed this pattern with goals framed in terms of enjoyment.

However, it is not yet clear whether this deficit reflects a delay in overall development or specific social-cognitive deficits and personality characteristics that hinder their acquisition of this behavior. Therefore, the present study examined the social-cognitive skills, personality characteristics, and behavioral development of children with autism who had IQ's within the average range. These children were compared to children diagnosed with other social deficits (specifically children diagnosed with ADHD/ODD) and typically developing peers. Participants were ten high functioning children with autism (IQ > 85), 19 children with ADHD/ODD, and 10 typically developing children. All were boys. Participants were administered the Social Orientation Choice Card, tests of social perspective taking (understanding others' emotions), a Prisoner's Dilemma task, and the Vocabulary and Block Design subtests of the WISC-III or WPPSI-R. Parents completed the Behavioral Development Questionnaire. The high functioning children with autism outperformed the children with ADHD/ODD and did not differ significantly from the typically developing children on the following variables: cooperative behavior, level of emotional understanding on the theory of mind task, and aloof behavior. However, there was evidence for an autism-specific deficit in the ability to recognize emotional facial expressions. Further, the children with autism were rated as exhibiting more active but odd behavior and less typically developing behavior than their typically developing peers. Thus, the results indicate that high functioning children with autism can develop advanced theory of mind abilities and engage in cooperative social interactions. However, they continue to show some social-cognitive and behavioral deficits, although those deficits may not be as severe as in children with ADHD/ODD. Future research should further assess whether specific skills and attitudes affect the ability of children with autism to interact with peers and whether treatment can address the deficits identified.

It is associated with a variety of negative outcomes such as coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, occupational and family maladjustment, erratic driving, etc., and can be a precursor to aggression. Thus, it is important to investigate those variables that mediate its expression. In this study, anger expression was examined in four social context conditions: social-encouragement (to outwardly express anger), social-discouragement (to hold anger in), social-neutral (no prompt for anger expression), and solitary (no observer). Gender differences in anger expression were also examined. Sixty men and sixty women engaged in a Prisoner's Dilemma based anger induction procedure labeled as WAR. Angry feelings were assessed at pre-test and post-test by the Spielberger State Anger Scale (1999). The frequency of competitive responses was assessed as part of the WAR task and provided a behavioral measure of anger expression. In addition, while playing WAR, the participants typed responses to their opponents and these were coded as indicators of verbal anger expression. Results showed that the sample as a whole significantly increased in state anger from pre-test to post-test. Subjects in social-encouragement and solitary social context groups significantly increased in state anger scores from pre-test to post-test. Both men and women made significant increases in State Anger from pre-test to post-test. Social Context groups did not differ in State Anger at post-test, nor did men and women. A main effect of social context on angry typed responses was found. The order (highest to lowest) of social context groups according to their mean angry-typed responses scores was encouragement, solitary, neutral, and discouragement, respectively. A main effect of gender on frequency of competitive responses was also found. Men scored significantly higher than women in their behavioral anger expression. These results support the important role of the social environment as a final determinant of anger expression. When angry, subjects were guided by the presence and behavior of the observer (confederate) when engaging in verbal modes of responding. Confirming traditional gender specific modes of expressing anger, men more frequently expressed their anger with outward 'attacks.'

Recency effects are defined as increased memory for recent information, as well as preferential reliance on such information in determining responses. Such behavior is often interpreted as suboptimal, indicating limitations of human cognitive architecture. However, recent research suggests that recency effects reflect an adaptation to the temporal structure of our cognitive environment, and furthermore one which is adjustable (J. R. Anderson & Schooler, 2000; R. B. Anderson et al., 1997). I elaborate on this perspective through studies of verbal working memory, category learning, and game theory. First, a computational model of working memory, based on recurrent neural networks, is presented which exhibits transient storage of information, with a characteristic decay time that adapts to the task environment. This model is extended to a model of verbal serial recall that can explain all of the most robust phenomena associated with the task. Next, data are presented from an empirical investigation of repeated cued classification, in which the serial correlation among category outcomes is manipulated. The results show that recency effects in this task are adaptable as well, and a modification to existing categorization models is proposed to account for this adaptation. Finally, recency effects in simple social interactions are investigated using the framework of iterated matrix games. It is proven analytically that under reasonable conditions it is individually rational for all players to act with an arbitrarily short memory span. This result is applied to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma to derive a class of rational yet cooperative policies for that game. Together, these three investigations show how choosing actions based primarily on recent events can be rational in certain situations, lead to proposals of specific psychological mechanisms for online learning and adjusting of the magnitude of recency effects, and demonstrate that inclusion of these mechanisms within models of choice and memory performance can provide unified explanations of adaptive recency effects with other established phenomena.

To the extent that a description provides specific examples of an event, people provide more extreme probability judgments of that event than they if they had read a broad description of the event. Considerable research has demonstrated support theory biases, but none has examined how social factors affect these biases. Therefore, this dissertation demonstrated two different ways in which social factors moderate support theory biases. Specifically, the first pair of experiments demonstrated how the social content of judged events causes support theory biases, and the third experiment demonstrated how aspects of the social environment attenuate support theory biases. In the first pair of experiments, participants read stories depicting strategic interactions of interest to game theorists: the Prisoner's Dilemma Game or the Game of Chicken. Then, participants considered alternative ways in which the story could have ended, described either broadly or as specific examples of alternative ways. The results demonstrated a support theory bias: participants who considered specific alternative ways in which the story could have ended inflated their probability judgments of those endings compared to participants who considered the broad description of alternative endings. The third experiment explored whether or not an aspect of the social environment, namely holding people accountable, attenuates support theory biases. Participants read either a broad description of an event that could happen next year or one with specific examples of the event and judged the probability of that event. In addition, some participants believed they would have to explain and justify their judgments to an expert, while others did not. The participants who believed they would have to explain and justify their judgments showed significantly reduced support theory biases. The results these experiments demonstrate how social psychological factors can either magnify or attenuate support theory biases. In the process, these experiments reveal conditions under which social factors cause people either to deviate from normative standards for judgment or to conform to those standards.

Concurrently, other researchers have developed the social (or Machiavellian) intelligence hypothesis, which suggests that human intelligence evolved primarily for the purpose of navigating a complex social space composed of conspecifics whose interests are in part mutual, but also in part conflicting. These lines of research are brought together in a computer simulation that models the evolution of cooperation and social intelligence in an ecology that offers opportunities not only for cooperation, but for conflict as well. I show that when agents with even a limited ability to perceive each other's intentions interact in an ecology that offers a choice between games, likely defectors are non-randomly offered opportunities for conflict and excluded from potentially cooperative interactions, resulting in lesser gains and cross-generational selection against the tendency to defect.

shown that the interaction with another social game in which good
reputation attracts help, can maintain a high level of cooperation in
the public goods game. Here we show experimentally that humans use
different strategies in the public goods game conditional on whether the
player knows that his decisions will be either known or unknown in

capable of promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the
Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities, the
readiness to cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies can be
largely suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation for
being willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and fair
outcomes are achieved. This group-beneficial result is obtained,
intriguingly, by making individuals more likely to exploit their

this framework in a series of one-shot public goods games in which

increasing in the internal return, indicating that decisions are
sensitive to the costs of helping others. We specify a logit equilibrium
model in which individuals are motivated by own and others' earnings,
and in which choice is stochastic. Maximum likelihood estimates of
(representative-agent) altruism and logit parameters are significant and
of reasonable magnitudes, and the resulting two-parameter model tracks
the pattern of contributions across the ten treatments. A richer model

We examined a sample of 408 nonstudent residents from Tokyo, Japan, who were evenly distributed across age (20–59) and sex. Participants played five economic games each separated by a few months. We demonstrated that prosocial behavior increased with age beyond early adulthood and this effect was shown across all five economic games. A similar, but weaker, age-related trend was found in one of three social value orientation measures of prosocial preferences. We measured participants’ belief that manipulating others is a wise strategy for social success, and found that this belief declined with age. Participants’ satisfaction with the unilateral exploitation outcome of the prisoner’s dilemma games also declined with age. These two factors—satisfaction with the DC outcome in the prisoner’s dilemma games and belief in manipulation— mediated the age effect on both attitudinal and behavioral prosociality. Participants’ age-related socio-demographic traits such as marriage, having children, and owning a house weakly mediated the age effect on prosociality through their relationships with satisfaction with the DC outcome and belief in manipulation.

Paralleling this phenomenon, observing emotional states (including pain) in others is associated with activity in the same brain areas as activated when experiencing similar emotions directly. This emotion perception associated activity has been shown to be affected by the perceived fairness of the actor, and in-group membership more generally. Here, we examine whether action observation associated brain activity is also affected by the perceived social fairness of the actors. Perceived fairness was manipulated using an alternating iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game between the participant and two confederates, one of whom played fairly and the other unfairly. During fMRI scanning the participants watched movies of the confederates performing object-directed hand actions, and then performed hand actions themselves. Massunivariate analysis showed that observing the actions triggered robust activation in regions associated with action execution, but failed to identify a strong modulation of this activation based on perceived fairness. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, identified clusters potentially carrying information about the perceived fairness of the actor in the middle temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, right middle cingulate cortex, right angular gyrus, and right superioroccipital gyrus. Despite being identified by a whole-brain searchlight analysis (and so without anatomical restriction), these clusters fall into areas frequently associated with action observation. We conclude that brain activity during action observation may be modulated by perceived fairness, but such modulation is subtle; robust activity is associated with observing the actions of both fair and unfair individuals.

Prior research indicates that both mental and real images provide access to implicit motives. We therefore proposed that visionary images motivate people by arousing their implicit motives and tested this hypothesis in two experimental studies. Method: We used guided visualizations to administer motive-domain-specific visionary images (Study 1: achievement and neutral, Mage = 24.4, 51 participants, 34 women; Study 2: affiliation and power, Mage = 24.01, 51 participants, 28 women) to arouse the respective implicit motive. Motivation was measured via residual changes in affective (i.e., changes in affective arousal), behavioral (i.e., performance on a concentration task, behavioral choices in a prisoner’s dilemma), and mental (i.e., motive imagery in the Picture Story Exercise) indicators of motivation. Results: The results largely confirmed our hypothesis. Visionary images increased motivation in the targeted domain. Some effects were moderated by participants’ implicit motives. Conclusions: The findings underscore the role of implicit motives in understanding the motivational effectiveness of visionary images.

While it is now clear that imagined contact can improve intergroup attitudes, its ability to change actual intergroup behavior is less well established. Some emerging findings provide cause for optimism with nonverbal, and unobtrusive measures of behavior. This paper extends this work by adopting methods from behavioral economics to examine more deliberative behavior. Participants believed they were playing a prisoner’s dilemma with an outgroup member. They could choose whether to cooperate or compete with the other player. In three studies, we provide reliable evidence that imagined contact (vs. control) successfully encouraged more prosocial, cooperative choices. In the third study we show that this effect is mediated by increased trust towards the outgroup member. The findings demonstrate that imagined contact interventions can have a tangible impact on volitional intergroup behaviors.

Eventually evaluative traits were introduced and found useful in the study of EGs, namely the HEXACO dimension honesty/humility (H/H). As an extensive list of evaluative traits, the Values In Action classification of character strengths may complement H/H when assessing character and predicting individuals' decisions in EGs. For this study, N = 155 participants completed the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths, a measure of the HEXACO traits, and four different EGs that involved decisions relevant to fairness and altruism. Along with H/H, individuals' positions on a dimension abstracting heart-related vs. mind-related character strengths predicted outcomes in the EGs. These results support earlier findings that evaluative traits predict decisions relevant to fairness and altruism.

It is shaped by social experiences in early life, especially by parent–infant interactions. The single nucleotid polymorphism rs53576 in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene has been linked to social behavioral phenotypes. Method: In 195 adult healthy subjects we investigated the interaction of OXTR rs53576 and childhood attachment security (CAS) on the personality traits 'adult attachment style' and 'alexithymia' (i.e. emotional self-awareness), on brain structure (voxel-based morphometry) and neural activation (fMRI) during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (prisoner's dilemma game; subgroup: n = 163). Results: We found that in GG-homozygotes, but not in A-allele carriers, insecure childhood attachment is—in adulthood—associated with a) higher attachment-related anxiety and alexithymia, b) higher brain gray matter volume of left amygdala and lower volumes in right superior parietal lobule (SPL), left temporal pole (TP), and bilateral frontal regions, and c) higher mentalizing-related neural activity in bilateral TP and precunei, and right middle and superior frontal gyri. Interaction effects of genotype and CAS on brain volume and/or function were associated with individual differences in alexithymia and attachment-related anxiety. Interactive effects were in part sexually dimorphic. Conclusion: The interaction of OXTR genotype and CAS modulates adult personality as well as brain structure and function of areas implicated in salience processing and mentalizing. Rs53576 GG-homozygotes are partially more susceptible to childhood attachment experiences than A-allele carriers.

The reciprocal trust players develop during the first game is thought to mediate transfer of learning effects. Recently, a computational cognitive model using a novel trust mechanism has been shown to account for human behavior in both games, including the transfer between games. We present the results of a study in which we evaluate the model’s a priori predictions of human learning and transfer in 16 different conditions. The model’s predictive validity is compared against five model variants that lacked a trust mechanism. The results suggest that a trust mechanism is necessary to explain human behavior across multiple conditions, even when a human plays against a non-human agent. The addition of a trust mechanism to the other learning mechanisms within the cognitive architecture, such as sequence learning, instance-based learning, and utility learning, leads to better prediction of the empirical data. It is argued that computational cognitive modeling is a useful tool for studying trust development, calibration, and repair.

that trust has an effect on heart rate arousal and synchrony, a result
consistent with research on joint action and experimental economics. We
engaged participants in a series of joint action tasks which, for one
group of participants, was interleaved with a PGG, and measured their
heart synchrony and arousal. We found that the introduction of the
economic game shifted participants' attention to the dynamics of the
interaction. This was followed by increased arousal and synchrony of
heart rate profiles. Also, the degree of heart rate synchrony was
predictive of participants' expectations regarding their partners in the
economic game. We conclude that the above changes in physiology and
behavior are shaped by the valuation of other people's social behavior,

emerges when individuals face the possibility of costly punishing
others: antisocial punishment, that is, costly punishing cooperative
individuals. So far, however, little is known about the individual
differences and situational factors that are associated with the dark
side of costly punishment. This research deals with this shortcoming. We
argue that antisocial punishment reflects the basic characteristics of
sadism, namely, aggressive behaviour to dominate and to harm other
individuals. We further argue that antisocial punishment may reflect a
type of behaviour that allows for the maintenance of self-esteem
(through aggressively dominating others). Therefore, we expect that
individuals who report a disposition for everyday sadism are
particularly likely to engage in antisocial punishment when their self
has been threatened (by thinking about one's own death). In a study
(N=99), we found empirical support for this assumption. The present
research contributes to a better understanding of antisocial punishment
and suggests that sadistic tendencies play a crucial role, especially
when the self is (existentially) threatened. Copyright (c) 2015 European

little research has shown whether such differences have an evolutionary
basis. Integrating research in cross-cultural psychology with
evolutionary game theory, we show that groups that face a high degree of
threat develop stronger norms for organizing social interaction, with a
higher degree of norm-adherence and higher punishment for deviant
behavior. Conversely, groups that have little threat can afford to have
weaker norms with less punishment for deviance. Our results apply to two
kinds of norms: norms of cooperation, in which individuals must choose
whether to cooperate (thereby benefitting everyone) or enrich themselves
at the expense of others; and norms of coordination, in which there are
several equally good ways for individuals to coordinate their actions,
but individuals need to agree on which way to coordinate. This is the
first work to show that different degrees of norm strength are
evolutionarily adaptive to societal threat. Evolutionary game theoretic
models of cultural adaptation may prove fruitful for exploring the
causes of many other cultural differences that may be adaptive to
particular ecological and historical contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

parametrically by the dynamically developing social tie-as estimated by
our model-supporting a role of these regions in social tie formation.
Activity in these two regions further reflected inter-individual
differences in tie persistence and sensitivity to behavior of the
interaction partner. Functional connectivity between pSTS and mPFC
activations indicated that the representation of social ties is
integrated in the decision process. These data reveal the brain
mechanisms underlying the integration of interaction dynamics into a

cooperatively and sustainably in a fishing-themed commons dilemma,
compared to participants who watched an architectural video (Study 1 and

The effects were not due to mood, and this was corroborated in Study 3

a 2 x 2 design. Participants exposed to nature videos responded more

assembled individuals spontaneously engage in costly group competition,

high levels of within-group cooperation. Remarkably, when groups were
given the possibility to compete against other groups, net earnings for

humans are the result of selection for the ability to gather, process,

strongly and consistently differ in what type of social information they
are interested in. Although some individuals mainly attend to what the
majority is doing (frequency-based learning), others focus on the
success that their peers achieve with their behavior (success-based
learning). Here, we show that such differences in social learning have
important consequences for the outcome of social interactions. We report
on a decision-making experiment in which individuals were first
classified as frequency- and success-based learners and subsequently
grouped according to their learning strategy. When confronted with a
social dilemma situation, groups of frequency-based learners cooperated
considerably more than groups of success-based learners. A detailed
analysis of the decision-making process reveals that these differences
in cooperation are a direct result of the differences in information
use. Our results show that individual differences in social learning

might be reticent to intervene because they are stuck in ``social

decisions based on self-interest due to their lack of confidence that
others will join with them in decisions that benefit the collective. In
this study, the social dilemmas concept, which comes from game theory
and social psychology, was applied to bullying for the first time. A
total of 292 middle school students at a private residential school in
the United States completed surveys about their bullying-related
experiences within their residences of 10 to 12 students of the same
gender. Multilevel modeling was employed to assess if and how attitudes,
group norms, and social dilemmas predict behavior in bullying
situations. The findings suggested that both individual and group
factors were associated with behavior in bullying situations and that
attitudes, group norms, and social dilemmas each made a unique
contribution to predicting behavior in bullying situations. (C) 2015

based on generous actions, (i) is more likely to lead to the evolution

understanding decision makers' motivations for cooperation or defection.
We examined these in five real-world social dilemmas: situations where
private interests are at odds with collective ones. An online survey (N
= 929) asked respondents whether or not they cooperated in each social
dilemma and then elicited both open-ended reports of reasons for their
choices and endorsements of a provided list of reasons. The dilemmas
chosen were ones that permit individual action rather than voting or
advocacy: (1) conserving energy, (2) donating blood, (3) getting a flu
vaccination, (4) donating to National Public Radio (NPR), and (5) buying
green electricity. Self-reported cooperation is weakly but positively
correlated across these dilemmas. Cooperation in each dilemma correlates
fairly strongly with self-reported altruism and with punitive attitudes
toward defectors. Some strong domain-specific behaviors and beliefs also
correlate with cooperation. The strongest example is frequency of
listening to NPR, which predicts donation. Socio-demographic variables
relate only weakly to cooperation. Respondents who self-report
cooperation usually cite social reasons (including reciprocity) for
their choice. Defectors often give self-interest reasons but there are
also some domain-specific reasons-some report that they are not eligible
to donate blood; some cannot buy green electricity because they do not
pay their own electric bills. Cooperators generally report that several
of the provided reasons match their actual reasons fairly well, but most
defectors endorse none or at most one of the provided reasons for
defection. In particular, defectors often view cooperation as costly but
do not endorse free riding as a reason for defection. We tentatively
conclude that cooperation in these settings is based mostly on
pro-social norms and defection on a mixture of self-interest and the
possibly motivated perception that situational circumstances prevent
cooperation in the given situation.}",article,ISI:000345744700001,{6},,{SOC JUDGMENT \& DECISION MAKING},,,{2020-11-05},{DOAJ Gold},{ISI:000345744700001},{AU6XL},{Judgm. Decis.

W.","{Although theory suggests individuals are more willing to incur a
personal cost to benefit ingroup members, compared to outgroup members,
there is inconsistent evidence in support of this perspective. Applying
meta-analytic techniques, we harness a relatively recent explosion of
research on intergroup discrimination in cooperative decision making to
address several fundamental unresolved issues. First, summarizing
evidence across studies, we find a small to medium effect size
indicating that people are more cooperative with ingroup, compared to
outgroup, members (d = 0.32). Second, we forward and test predictions
about the conditions that moderate ingroup favoritism from 2 influential
perspectives: a social identity approach and a bounded generalized
reciprocity perspective. Although we find evidence for a slight tendency
for ingroup favoritism through categorization with no mutual
interdependence between group members (e.g., dictator games; d = 0.19),
situations that contain interdependence result in stronger ingroup
favoritism (e.g., social dilemmas; d = 0.42). We also find that ingroup
favoritism is stronger when there is common (vs. unilateral) knowledge
of group membership, and stronger during simultaneous (vs. sequential)
exchanges. Third, we find support for the hypothesis that intergroup
discrimination in cooperation is the result of ingroup favoritism rather
than outgroup derogation. Finally, we test for additional moderators of
ingroup favoritism, such as the percentage of men in the sample,
experimental versus natural groups, and the country of participants. We
discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical perspectives
on ingroup favoritism, address implications for the methodologies used
to study this phenomenon, and suggest directions for future research.}",article,ISI:000344354000006,{6},,{AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000344354000006},{AS6DD},{Psychol.

including cooperation, sharing, and strategic behaviors within
professional contexts. Specifically, individuals' preferences for self
vs. other outcomes (social value orientation) are predictive of
strategic sharing behaviors in mixed motive situations. For instance,
self-focused individuals tend to share fewer resources and maximize
their own outcomes. In this study, we examine a newly developed
personality measure, Give \& Take, which focuses on self vs. other
outcomes and evaluates individuals' primary interaction style (i.e.,
giver, matcher, or taker). We demonstrate that while Give \& Take
correlates with theoretically related constructs such as social value
orientation, narcissism, and reciprocity, it has unique predictive
validity for sharing behavior. Specifically, when examining Give \& Take
simultaneously with social value orientation, we found that Give \& Take
predicted sharing in both a public goods dilemma task and a strategic
information-sharing task above and beyond social value orientation. In
general, takers contributed fewer resources to a public good and also
shared less information, especially important information, with others.
Findings suggest that this new measure may be useful for explaining
interpersonal dynamics, particularly within professional contexts. (C)

factors are associated with individuals' tendency to engage in
destructive antisocial punishment, that is, to costly punish cooperative
individuals in public goods situations. In this work, we focus on the
interplay of endogenous cortisol with testosterone and dominance. We
applied the dual-hormone hypothesis according to which testosterone is
positively associated with destructive and dominant behavior but only in
individuals with low levels of cortisol. Study 1 shows that individuals
are more likely to engage in destructive antisocial punishment in a
public goods game with the option to punish when their testosterone
level is high, given that their level of cortisol is low, which bolsters
the dual-hormone hypothesis. In contrast, no significant interaction
effect of testosterone and cortisol emerges for the punishment of
uncooperative free-riders (altruistic punishment). In a second study, we
build on these findings and document that self-reported dominance is
only positively associated with antisocial punishment (but not with
altruistic punishment) when cortisol is low. In sum, the results
indicate the importance of taking endocrinological and psychological

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) enhanced happy face
recognition, and dominance behaviors which might reflect enhancement of
reward sensitivity. The present study aimed to determine whether such a
mechanism would be related to social resource acquisition induced by an
SSRI. Forty healthy subjects were recruited for the experiment. A
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover nested within
confederate type (happy, fearful, or sad) trial of a single-dose of 10
mg escitalopram versus placebo was conducted with a two-week washout
period. In each of the treatment groups, the subjects interacted
socially with one of the three types of confederate in a waiting room
for 3-minute. Then, they went to an individual laboratory and were led
to believe that they played the Mixed-motive game with the confederate.
The game measures punitive/cooperative behaviors by how participants
allocate higher/lower game scores to the confederate and communicate
cooperation/ingratiation/helplessness/sadness/blaming/extrapunitive,
messages to the confederate. Significant treatment-by-confederate type
interactions were observed through game score distributions and
ingratiation messages to the confederate and attentive eye gaze. In the
happy confederate condition, escitalopram increased ingratiation
messages and lowered points awarded to the confederate. In the fearful
confederate condition, escitalopram increased ingratiation messages and
reduced time spent looking away from the confederate. No changes in
these measures were found in the sad confederate condition. Therefore
acute escitalopram treatment enhances reward sensitivity to the facial
emotions of social partners which in turn increases social resource
acquisition and social dominance towards happy but not fearful social
partners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000344210800008,{10},,{ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000344210800008},{AS3YK},{Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol.},{15},{0},{4},{38},"{Funding for this study was provided by Strategic Research Grant (SRG),

treated as independent. However, if beliefs and preferences interact,
this may have implications for the interpretation of observed behavior.
Our sequential social dilemma experiment allows us to separate different
interaction channels. When subjects play both roles in such experiments,
a positive correlation between first- and second-mover behavior is
frequently reported. We find that the observed correlation primarily
originates via an indirect channel, where second-mover decisions
influence beliefs through a consensus effect, and the first-mover
decision is a best response to these beliefs. Specifically, beliefs
about second-mover cooperation are biased toward own second-mover
behavior, and most subjects best respond to stated beliefs. However, we
also find evidence for a direct, preference-based channel. When first
movers know the true probability of second-mover cooperation, subjects'
own second moves still have predictive power regarding their first

The participants’ common identity is primed to make neighborhood membership salient before individuals make donations to local non-profit organizations. We find that the identity treatment is sensitive to community context. It decreases the likelihood of giving in the struggling, poor neighborhood, but its impact is positive, albeit statistically insignificant, in the low- to middle-income neighborhood.

The literature is also silent on the fact that groups providing similar public goods often compete with one another to attract new members. We extend the reach of theories of collective action problems to bring them to bear on these interrelated issues. Results from four experiments support our predictions about when group members compete to attract new adherents by sacrificing more for group goals. Further, we find that prospective members join more productive groups at much higher rates and then contribute to them at high levels. These processes give way to cumulative advantage, whereby initially productive groups continually attract new members. Thus competition for members can yield large inequalities in the size and success of collective action groups.

Four treatments frame two variables, each in one of two ways: the contribution metric is expressed either in absolute terms or relative to endowments, and the contribution choice is framed as either keeping or contributing some of one’s endowment. Subjects can exchange proposals and counterproposals. Our results reveal a broad consensus that high endowed subjects contribute more in absolute terms than the low endowed, which we trace to subjects’ reported distributive preferences. Both high and low endowed subjects contribute about two-thirds of their endowments in all treatments—Save when the metric is framed as 'contributing' in 'absolute' terms: then the low endowed contribute significantly more, around 80%. This last result suggests the possibility that the most frequently used frame in public good experiments induces higher contributions among the less affluent than economically equivalent alternate frames.

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we apply three choice models to the example of recycling behavior: a standard rational choice model, the low-cost hypothesis, and a dual-process theory. The models carry competing hypotheses about the interplay of trust and incentives in recycling behavior. Using survey data collected in four countries (Sweden, Denmark, the United States, and the United Kingdom), we find a positive and significant interaction effect of institutional trust and recycling costs on self-reported recycling behavior. No such interaction was found using generalized social trust as a second measure of trust. Our results support a dual-process perspective and indicate that high levels of institutional trust can suppress the inhibiting effect of individual costs on cooperation in a collective action dilemma.

On the group level, it leads to the highest contribution level and the lowest inequality in total profits as measured by the Gini index.

We obtain theoretical bounds on the efficiency gains that are obtainable under these different communication structures.

The mechanism satisfies critical out-of-equilibrium desiderata that previously-introduced mechanisms fail to satisfy, and always (weakly) yields Pareto improvements, whether in equilibrium or not. The mechanism requires participants to communicate prices and quantities, and turns these into outcomes according to a natural and intuitive outcome function. Our approach first exploits the equivalence, when there are only two participants, between the private-good and public-good allocation problems to obtain a two-person public-good mechanism, and then we generalize the public-good mechanism to an arbitrary number of participants.

Contributions to the public good are negatively affected by the presence of impure public goods with token contributions.

study tested the hypothesis that one's degree of trust in others will
influence the extent to which one reacts to the presence of fear (or the
possibility of receiving no payoff for cooperative actions) in a payoff
matrix. The hypothesis was formally tested with public goods games and
resource dilemma games, with fear manipulated. Results support the
hypothesis: when fear was present, high trusters cooperated more
frequently than low trusters; when absent, high and low trusters
cooperated at the same rate. The findings held across both games.
However, the effects of fear within each game were not straightforward:
removing fear from the resource dilemma increased low trusters'
cooperation rates, but removing fear from the public goods game
decreased high trusters' cooperation rates. Results imply that
discussion of the role of trust in cooperation must consider whether the

contributions to public goods, continues to present a problem. One
possibility is that cooperation can pay through developing a reputation
that makes one more likely to be chosen for a profitable cooperative
partnership, a process termed competitive altruism (CA) or
reputation-based partner choice. Here, we show, to our knowledge, for
the first time, that investing in a cooperative reputation can bring net
benefits through access to more cooperative partners. Participants
played a public goods game (PGG) followed by an opportunity to select a
partner for a second cooperative game. We found that those who gave more
in the PGG were more often selected as desired partners and received
more in the paired cooperative game. Reputational competition was even
stronger when it was possible for participants to receive a higher
payoff from partner choice. The benefits of being selected by a more
cooperative partner outweighed the costs of cooperation in the
reputation building phase. CA therefore provides an alternative to
indirect reciprocity as an explanation for reputation-building
behaviour. Furthermore, while indirect reciprocity depends upon
individuals giving preference to those of good standing, CA can explain
unconditional cooperation.}",article,ISI:000281739100024,{5},,{ROYAL SOC},,,{2020-11-04},"{Green Published, Bronze}",{ISI:000281739100024},{649AW},{Biol.

cooperation remains one of the greatest challenges in the biological and
social sciences. A number of theoretical studies have suggested that
competition between groups may have played a key role in the evolution
of cooperation within human societies, and similar ideas have been
discussed for other organisms, especially cooperative breeding
vertebrates. However, there is a relative lack of empirical work testing
these ideas. Our experiment found, in public goods games with humans,
that when groups competed with other groups for financial rewards,
individuals made larger contributions within their own groups. In such
situations, participants were more likely to regard their group mates as
collaborators rather than competitors. Variation in contribution among
individuals, either with or without intergroup competition, was
positively correlated with individuals' propensity to regard group mates
as collaborators. We found that the levels of both guilt and anger
individuals experienced were a function of their own contributions and
those of their group mates. Overall, our results arc consistent with the
idea that the level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate
emotions, which vary with the degree of intergroup competition. (C) 2010

collective action problems. Each participant chooses how much to

Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than
reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical
design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for
today's actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods
games followed by punishment, reward, or both in the setting of truly
repeated games, in which player identities persist from round to round.
We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public
cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both
options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and
payoff, whereas punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to
lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated
public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings

based on the assumption that people care (either positively or

then is an outcome of utility maximization where utility depends on
subjects' own payoffs as well as on the payoffs of other players. In
this paper, I study to what extent this assumption of utility
interdependence is responsible for over-contribution. I design three
treatments where subjects' decisions cannot affect opponents' payoffs
and thus utility interdependence cannot explain cooperative behavior.
The main result is that while average contribution in these treatments
is below the benchmark it nonetheless stays well above zero. Even when
no one benefits from subjects' generosity the average contributions are
as high as one third of the endowment and are only 25\% below those in

involves incurring costs to confer benefits on unrelated others.
Punishment of noncooperators can sustain otherwise fragile cooperation,
but the provision of punishment suffers from a ``second-order{''}
free-riding problem because nonpunishers can free ride on the benefits
from costly punishment provided by others. One suggested solution to
this problem is second-order punishment of nonpunishers; more generally,
the threat or promise of higher order sanctions might maintain the lower
order sanctions that enforce cooperation in collective action problems.
Here the authors report on 3 experiments testing people's willingness to
provide second-order sanctions by having participants play a cooperative
game with opportunities to punish and reward each other. The authors
found that people supported those who rewarded cooperators either by
rewarding them or by punishing nonrewarders, but people did not support
those who punished noncooperators-they did not reward punishers or
punish nonpunishers. Furthermore, people did not approve of punishers
more than they did nonpunishers, even when nonpunishers were clearly
unwilling to use sanctions to support cooperation. The results suggest
that people will much more readily support positive sanctions than they
will support negative sanctions.}",article,ISI:000259336300005,{4},,{AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000259336300005},{350EV},{J. Pers. Soc.

game when inequality arises endogenously from the subjects' behavior.
Second, this paper investigates the impact of punishment on both
absolute and relative incomes. We compare three treatments of our game.
The Unequal Cost treatment replicates Fehr and Gachter (2000)'s
experiment under a stranger matching protocol. The Equal Cost treatment
is identical to the previous one except that the ratio between the cost
of one punishment point to the punisher and its cost to the target
equals one. The third treatment is similar to the second one except that
a partner matching protocol is implemented in order to isolate strategic
motives for punishment. Our results indicate that subjects punish even
when they cannot alter the current distribution of payoffs. We also find
that in all treatments, the intensity of punishment increases in the
level of inter-individual inequality. Finally, despite its cost,
punishment progressively improves welfare in association with a decrease

use in the context of group cooperation. Here we report an experiment in
which participants in public goods games could access information about
the lowest, median, or highest contribution to the public good before
making their own contribution decisions. Results suggest that people
have clear preferences for particular pieces of information and that
information preferences vary systematically across individuals as a
function of their contribution strategies. Specifically, participants
playing reciprocal strategies sought information about the median
contribution, free riders preferred to view the highest contribution,
and altruists had inconsistent preferences. By including a treatment in
which people could pay to see information rather than obtaining it for
free, we found that people were willing to incur costs to acquire
information, particularly those using a reciprocal strategy. Further
adding a cost to view information decreased aggregate contributions,
possibly because the motivation to induce others' reciprocal
contributions diminished under these conditions. Copyright (c) 2007 John

cooperation in children: sex, group size, and information on the number
of sessions. Group size was the only factor to significantly affect
cooperation, with small-group children cooperating significantly more

Here we report the results of the first experimental manipulation of a

players in a variant of the ``tragedy of the commons,{''} the one-shot

made to the public good and the punishment of free riders-is supported

the greatest ``public goods game{''} played by humans. However,with > 6
billion ``players{''} taking part, the game seems to rule out individual
altruistic behavior. Thus, climate protection is a problem of sustaining
a public resource that everybody is free to overuse, a ``tragedy of the
commons{''} problem that emerges in many social dilemmas. We perform a
previously undescribed type of public goods experiment with human
subjects contributing to a public pool. In contrast to the standard
protocol, here the common pool is not divided among the participants;
instead, it is promised that the pool will be invested to encourage
people to reduce their fossil fuel use. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that players can behave altruistically to maintain the
Earth's climate given the right set of circumstances. We find a nonzero
basic level of altruistic behavior, which is enhanced if the players are
provided with expert information describing the state of knowledge in
climate research. Furthermore, personal investments in climate
protection increase substantially if players can invest publicly, thus
gaining social reputation. This increase occurs because subjects reward
other subjects' contributions to sustaining the climate, thus
reinforcing their altruism. Therefore, altruism may convert to net
personal benefit and to relaxing the dilemma if the gain in reputation
is large enough. Our finding that people reward contributions to
sustaining the climate of others is a surprising result. There are
obvious ways these unexpected findings can be applied on a large scale.}",article,ISI:000236429300013,{11},,{NATL ACAD SCIENCES},,,{2020-11-04},"{Bronze, Green Published}",{ISI:000236429300013},{027QE},{Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.},{66},{1},{182},{35},,,,,"{milinski@mpil-ploen.mpg.de

facial affect perception and social behaviours. It is illusive to
suggest that these deficits in facial affect perception cause poor
social behaviours.
Aim: The present research aims to study how facial affects influence
ingratiation, cooperation and punishment behaviours of the patients.
Methods: Forty outpatients with paranoid schizophrenia, 26 matched
depressed patients and 46 healthy volunteers were recruited. After
measurement of clinical symptoms and depression, their facial emotion
recognition, neurocognitive functioning and the facial affects dependent
cooperative behaviour were measured using a modified version of
Mixed-Motive Game.
Results: The depressed control group showed demographic characteristics,
depression levels and neurocognitive functioning similar to the
schizophrenic group. Patients with schizophrenia committed significantly
more errors in neutral face identification than the other two groups.
They were significantly more punitive on the Mixed-Motive Game in the
neutral face condition.
Conclusion: Neutral face misidentification was a unique
emotion-processing deficit in the schizophrenic group. Their increase in
punitive behaviours in the neutral face condition might confuse their
family members and trigger more expressed emotion from them, thus
increasing the risk of relapse. Family members might display more happy
faces to promote positive relationships with patients.}",article,ISI:000294441800010,{5},,{SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000294441800010},{814IL},{Int. J. Soc. Psychiatr.},{9},{1},{4},{41},,,"{Tse, Wai Shing/0000-0001-8059-2111}","{Chan, Raymond CK/B-6717-2009

reciprocity. Prior to their participation in the investment game, all
subjects participated in two other games. One is used to measure their
social value orientation (a measure of other regarding behavior) and the
second to measure risk attitudes. These variables are introduced as
treatments in the analysis of the trust and reciprocity data. In
addition to these preference related variables, gender is introduced to
capture any differences between men and women which may not be
encompassed by value orientation and risk attitudes. The statistical
analysis indicates that the social value orientation measure
significantly accounts for variation in trust and reciprocity. As well,
the level of trust exhibited by an investor significantly affects the
reciprocity of the responders and this measure of trust interacts with
social value orientation. individuals who are highly pro-social
reciprocate more as the sender's trust increases, while those who are
highly pro-self reciprocate less as the sender's trust increases. For
this sample of participants, the gender variable does not capture any
differences in the behavior of men and women that is not already
reflected by the differences captured by their value orientations. Risk
attitudes do not significantly account for variation in trusting
behavior, except for the case where individuals have neither strongly
pro-social nor pro-self social value orientations. In this case, more
risk-seeking individuals are more trusting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

social dilemmas are two important, but fundamentally different classes
of determinants of cooperative behavior. The former provides subjective
social information regarding the likelihood of attaining mutual
cooperation by shaping one's expectations of the cooperative behavior of
the interacting party. The latter provides objective, ecological
information about the strategic opportunities offered by the situation.
In prior research, both classes have generally been studied in
isolation, hampering insight into how social judgments and ecological
opportunities interact in shaping cooperation. To fill in this gap we
set up a repeated mixed-motive game in which we manipulate subtle social
cues and the incentive structure of the game simultaneously. We develop
the hypothesis that social information is less important in shaping
mutual cooperation of two team members when the incentive structure is
such that it contains natural synergies. In contrast, when the incentive
structure offers no synergy, ``rational contracting{''} is hampered and
social cues are essential for mutual cooperation to develop. The
evidence we present in this paper is consistent with this hypothesis.

others for long-term gains at the expense of noncooperative behaviors
giving larger immediate gains. Although little is know about the neural
substrates that support cooperative over noncooperative behaviors,
recent research has shown that mutually cooperative behavior in the
context of a mixed-motive game, the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), is
associated with increased neural activity within reinforcement
circuitry. Other research attests to a role for serotonin in the
modulation of social behavior and in reward processing. In this study,
we used a within-subject, crossover, double-blind design to investigate
performance of an iterated, sequential PD game for monetary reward by
healthy human adult participants following ingestion of an amino-acid
drink that either did (T+) or did not (T-) contain l-tryptophan.
Tryptophan depletion produced significant reductions in the level of
cooperation shown by participants when playing the game on the first,
but not the second, study days. This effect was accompanied by a
significantly diminished probability of cooperative responding given
previous mutually cooperative behavior. These data suggest that
serotonin plays a significant role in the acquisition of socially
cooperative behavior in human adult participants, and suggest novel
hypotheses concerning the serotonergic modulation of reward information
in socially cooperative behavior in both health and psychiatric illness.}",article,ISI:000236889500019,{5},,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-05},{Bronze},{ISI:000236889500019},{033XY},{Neuropsychopharmacology},{10},{0},{91},{66},,"{Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) {[}G0700410]

psychiatric disorders, is associated with rejection. A passive lack of
participation or involvement has been studied as characteristic of
depression but active forms of nonparticipation have received little
experimental attention. This study examined the interpersonal
consequences of four distinct types of social behaviour by using the
role enactment method. Two of the roles portrayed abnormal social
behaviour, active nonparticipant `manic' and passive nonparticipant
`sad', and two portrayed normal social behaviour, active participant
`warm' and passive participant `shy'. Methods: Sixty-three normal
subjects were randomly allocated to a brief dyadic social interaction
with a confederate acting one of four roles. Subsequently, they rated
their level of rejection of the confederate and took part in the
mixed-motive game with him/her. Results: The subjects were more likely
to reject confederates in the abnormal social behaviour roles. This was
shown on both their nonverbal behaviour and their verbal report. On the
mixed-motive game, subjects gave fewer points and less cooperative and
ingratiating messages to the confederates who had displayed abnormal
social behaviour. Limitations: This result might only reveal the effects
of first impressions of a confederate who behaves in a particular way,
but not be generalised to long term acquaintanceship. Conclusions: These
results extend previous findings that passive nonparticipant behaviour
leads to rejection to active nonparticipant behaviour and show that the
consequences of displaying such behaviour not only result in rejection
but also in the reduction of social reinforcement. This might slow a

Methods: Sixty volunteers were randomly assigned to a single dose of a

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (10 mg), or placebo.
They socially interacted with a confederate behaving in a non-sociable

fairness, expectations about other actors' harvesting decisions, and
communication on the focal actor's harvesting decisions in asymmetric
social dilemmas. We found support for the predictions that egocentrism
exists in perceptions of fairness in asymmetric dilemmas, overharvesting
is positively related to the amount of egocentrism, and egocentrism is
stronger before discussion than after discussion. Furthermore, in a
comparison between asymmetric and symmetric dilemmas, we found that
egocentrism and overharvesting were greater in asymmetric dilemmas than
in symmetric dilemmas. Finally, the results indicate that among certain
actors, overharvesting in asymmetric dilemmas is positively related to
the amount of harvesting expected from the other parties. This study
contributes to the social dilemma literature by (1) introducing the idea
of egocentric interpretations of fairness as an explanation for
overharvesting behavior, (2) demonstrating that egocentrism is more
pronounced in asymmetric versus symmetric dilemmas, (3) suggesting that
the reduction of egocentric interpretations of fairness is another
reason why communication enhances cooperative behavior, and (4)
demonstrating that beliefs about what others will do is related to
harvesting decisions in asymmetric as well as symmetric dilemmas. (C)

outcomes such as well-being and closeness. Less research has examined
group outcomes such as cohesiveness or collective action. Forgiveness
studies have also emphasized the victim's or transgressor's perspective,
neglecting the effects of forgiveness on ingroup members who have
neither given nor received forgiveness. We theorize that forgiveness
promotes collective action among ingroup members through group
cohesiveness and that transgressors' apologetic reactions impact this
process. In a laboratory experiment, 229 students (175 females) were led
to believe they were in a social dilemma with three others. Some
participants witnessed group members forgive an apologetic, obstinate,
or neutral defector, whereas others witnessed an unforgiving response.
Forgiveness of apologetic and neutral defectors increased later
cooperation among ingroup members. This effect was generally mediated by
group cohesiveness. Our findings suggest that forgiveness can impact
cooperation on a group level, providing a path to successful resolutions
to collective action problems. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

all players, and missing intermediate targets may lead to the same

environmental protection as a process rather than a contest for reaching

In this study, the biological roots for the proselfs/prosocials concept are explored by investigating the neural correlates of cooperative versus defect decisions when participants engage in a series of one-shot, anonymous prisoner’s dilemma situations. Our data are in line with previous studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognition regions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex, temporo–parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and that dispositional trust positively affects prosocials’ decisions to cooperate. At the neural level, however, dispositional trust appears to exert a greater marginal effect on brain activity of proselfs in three social cognition regions, which does not translate into an increase in cooperation. An event-related analysis shows that cooperating prosocials show significantly more activation in the precuneus (BA 7) than proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret this result to be consistent with prosocials’ enhanced tendency to infer the intentions of others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm congruence when they decide to cooperate.

Thus, this mechanism reflects that the dependency relation is stronger than the relation of ordinary mutual cooperation, but it is not large enough to cause the defection of the dependency pair. We show that the dependence of individuals hinders, promotes and never affects the cooperation on regular ring networks, square lattice, random and scale-free networks, respectively. The results for the square lattice and regular ring networks are demonstrated by the pair approximation.

In cognitive load experiments, subjects are directed to perform a task which occupies cognitive resources, in addition to making a choice in another domain. The greater the cognitive resources required for the task implies that fewer such resources are available for deliberation on the choice. In our experiment, subjects played a finitely repeated multi-player prisoner’s dilemma game under two cognitive load treatments. In one treatment, subjects were placed under a high cognitive load (given a 7 digit number to recall) and subjects in the other were placed under a low cognitive load (given a 2 digit number). According to two different measures, we find evidence that the low load subjects behaved more strategically. First, the low load subjects exhibited more strategic defection near the end of play than the high load subjects. Second, we find evidence that low load subjects were better able to condition their behavior on the outcomes of previous periods.

The second question refers to situational factors: how does the composition of the group influence the Machiavellians’ decisions? Using Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) scales, the scores on Mach IV test showed a positive correlation with Novelty Seeking and a negative correlation with Reward Dependence, Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-Transcendence. We found that the Mach scores negatively correlated with the players’ contribution over the game, and positively with the total profit they gained by the end of the game. Regression analyses revealed that the contribution of high Mach persons (those who had relatively high scores on Mach scale) to the public good were primarily influenced by the number of altruists in the group, whereas low Machs’ decisions were influenced more by a temperament factor (Persistence). We assume that, compared to others, Machiavellians may be more sensitive to situational factors and take the behavior of their playmates into account to a greater degree, which may lead to their success in the exploitation of others.

Controlling for relevant covariates, personality was associated with scores from the prisoner’s dilemma and the public goods game. Extroversion was associated with more cooperative game play in the prisoner’s dilemma and higher contributions in the public goods game. Higher levels of Extroversion and Openness were associated with low levels of antisocial punishment, whereas higher levels of Conscientiousness and lower levels of Neuroticism were related to higher levels of prosocial punishment. While the link between extroversion and more prosocial behavior across games should add a degree of clarity towards understanding the link between behavioral economic games and personality, results from the public goods game are difficult to place in the context of previous research, as this was the first time the five-factor model was examined in relation to punishment.

This line of research has also sought to develop an iterative economic version of the prisoner's dilemma game as a behavioral measure of changes in state anger. Preliminary studies demonstrated evidence that expressive writing about an angry memory does trigger initial activations of state anger and negative affect but that subsequent repeated writing does lead to reductions in activation of state anger and negative affect. The current study sought to expand upon those prior findings and more adequately test whether or not such reductions in the activation of state anger and negative affect can be attributed to habituation as a mechanism of change. The differential effects of different schedules of writing/exposure were also investigated. The current study reports data from 100 student participants. All participants participated in three study sessions scheduled two to three days apart. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: A Spaced Exposure Condition in which participants wrote about an angry memory once on each of three participation days. A Massed Exposure with Long Retention condition in which participants wrote twice about an angry memory on the first day, did not write the second day, and wrote again about an angry memory the third day. A Massed Exposure with Brief Retention condition in which participants did not write the first day, wrote twice about an angry memory the second day, and wrote once about an angry memory the final day. And a Neutral Writing Control group in which participants wrote about different emotionally neutral memories on each of the first two days and an angry memory on the final day. All participants played the economic prisoner's dilemma game on the first and last day of participation to examine differences in competitive behavior that may correlate with amount of expressive writing and levels of state anger and negative affect. The results found that expressive writing about an angry memory was consistently effective in triggering an acute increase in state anger and negative affect. There was some evidence of both within session and between session reductions of state anger and negative affect following repeated writing about an angry memory; however, these effects were tenuous and not able to be dissociated from uncontrolled factors occurring with the passage of time. Therefore, the results were unable to demonstrate evidence for habituation as a mechanism of change. The results are not able to provide support for any differential advantage to spaced or massed exposure sessions. The study does not support the use of the economic version of prisoner's dilemma game as a behavioral measure of changes in state anger. The limitations of the study and potential future empirical directions are discussed.

In the first chapter I show that an explanation for human altruism cannot rely solely on direct reciprocity and likely requires both cultural selection and groups. In the second I argue, with Sarah Mathew, that this insight applies especially well to between-group conflict in humans and can explain the unique scale and intensity of human warfare. In the third, I show how these 'norm dynamics,'' operating in an international system undergoing a 'globalization of ideas'' might help explain a decrease in interstate war over the last sixty years. In many societies, humans cooperate altruistically in economic experiments at much higher levels than would be expected if their goal was maximizing economic returns—even when interactions are anonymous and one-shot. This is a puzzle because there is no personal benefit in paying a cost to help another play in one-shot anonymous interactions. What are the origins of this seemingly altruistic behavior? This paper explores the logic of two competing hypotheses. The 'norm psychology'' hypothesis holds that pro-social play stems primarily from socially-learned cultural norms. In contrast, the 'evolutionary mismatch'' hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically humans' ancient past among our hunter-gatherer ancestors. In Chapter 1 I compare whether the conditions thought to create these genetic predispositions, repeated interactions under uncertainty, better support the conditions for the mismatch hypothesis (groups will be predominantly cooperative) or the norm psychology hypothesis (there will be wide variation between groups). As a test case, I adopt a model of the mismatch hypothesis developed by Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides and Tooby (DKCT). In the model agents play Prisoner's Dilemma games, but are uncertain whether an interaction is one-shot or repeated. In DKCT's simulations, populations of agents consistently evolve high levels of cooperation in one-shot games, even when they have strong evidence that an interaction is not repeated. This finding is consistent with the premises of the mismatch hypothesis. However, DKCT limit their agents' strategic possibilities to only two strategies, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) or Always Defect (ALLD). I show that their results are an artifact of the particular evolutionary trajectory caused by the interaction between these strategies. With different mixes of initial strategies, even when TFT starts out very common, the resulting frequency of one-shot cooperation varies widely—in some cases driving one-shot cooperation almost entirely from the population under a wide range of conditions. This finding better supports the norm psychology hypothesis than the mismatch hypothesis. I conclude that understanding variation between human groups is key for understanding the conditions that favor altruistic cooperation in human metapopulations. We argue that the scale and intensity of human warfare can best be explained by cultural selection operating in a group-structured environment (group-structured cultural selection). This view is backed by theoretical and empirical findings showing that cultural variation is much more likely than genetic variation to be partitioned by group membership when groups are large. In Chapter 2 we use historical and ethnographic examples to show that human warfare meets two sufficient and necessary conditions for group-structured cultural selection: there is variation in traits between groups that influence the outcome of warfare, the outcome of warfare influences the distribution of these traits between groups. Furthermore, alternative theories of human warfare that exogenize preferences, exogenize institutions or only include genetic transmission are incomplete theories that cannot account for the scale and intensity of human warfare.

In part, this empirical anomaly is due to the unrealistic assumptions concerning human behavior in economic models. Our study aims to offer new foundations for strategic decision-making behavior of individuals. We argue that human capital and personality traits are key in deciding whether or not to cooperate with a counterpart. Furthermore,-we argue that the effect of a particular personality trail—that is, locus of control—on cooperative behavior is moderated by the level of human capital. The hypotheses are tested using Prisoner's Dilemma games in an experiment with 182 university students. The results report significant direct effects of human capital and locus of control on cooperation and confirm the moderating relationship between the two. Internals tend to cooperate more when having high levels of human capital. For externals, the effect is opposite, that is, externals lend to cooperate more when having low levels of human capital. In so doing, we open the black box of individual decision-making behavior and contribute to a growing field of behavior of strategy research that aims to strengthen the empirical relevance and practical usefulness of management theory.

Under oxytocin, subjects were less accurate than placebo at predicting contestant decisions and only in the placebo condition were subjects able to accurately predict contestants’ decisions with a probability higher than chance. Additional analysis ruled out the possibility that the effects of oxytocin were affected by contestant partners’ decisions, subjects’ beliefs about whether they had received oxytocin or the placebo, or differences in mood or interpersonal closeness. Rather than improving subjects’ inferences about others’ mental states, oxytocin impeded accurate assessments of trustworthiness in risky social exchanges. Oxytocin decreased prediction accuracy but did not increase predictions of cooperative behavior in general.

To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we argue that decision conflict (rather than the use of intuition vs. reflection) drives response times, leading to an inverted-U shaped relationship between RT and cooperation. Studies 1 through 3 show that intermediate decisions take longer than both extremely selfish and extremely cooperative decisions. Studies 4 and 5 find that the conflict between self-interested and cooperative motives explains individual differences in RTs. Manipulating conflictedness causes longer RTs and more intermediate decisions, and RTs mediate the relationship between conflict and intermediate decisions. Finally, Studies 6 and 7 demonstrate that conflict is distinct from reflection by manipulating the use of intuition (vs. reflection). Experimentally promoting reliance on intuition increases cooperation, but has no effects on decision extremity or feelings of conflictedness. In sum, we provide evidence that RTs should not be interpreted as a direct proxy for the use of intuitive or reflective processes, and dissociate the effects of conflict and reflection in social decision making.

A distinguishing feature of our model is that the duration of the game is determined endogenously by the users’ collective decisions. In the proposed model, if the resource stock level below which the irreversible event occurs is known in advance, then the optimal resource use coincides with a unique symmetric equilibrium that guarantees survival of the resource. As the uncertainty about the threshold level increases, resource use increases if users adopt decision strategies that quickly deplete the resource stock, but decreases if they adopt path strategies guaranteeing that the unknown threshold level is never exceeded. We show that under relatively high uncertainty about resource size, CPR users frequently implement decision strategies that terminate the game immediately. When this uncertainty is reduced, they maintain a positive resource level for longer durations.

Since punishment is often costly, however, this raises an issue of second-order free-riding: indeed, the sanctioning system itself is a common good which can be exploited. Most investigations, so far, considered peer punishment: players could impose fines on those who exploited them, at a cost to themselves. Only a minority considered so-called pool punishment. In this scenario, players contribute to a punishment pool before engaging in the joint enterprise, and without knowing who the free-riders will be. Theoretical investigations (Sigmund et al., Nature 466:861–863, 2010) have shown that peer punishment is more efficient, but pool punishment more stable. Social learning, i.e., the preferential imitation of successful strategies, should lead to pool punishment if sanctions are also imposed on second-order free-riders, but to peer punishment if they are not. Here we describe an economic experiment (the Mutual Aid game) which tests this prediction. We find that pool punishment only emerges if second-order free riders are punished, but that peer punishment is more stable than expected. Basically, our experiment shows that social learning can lead to a spontaneously emerging social contract, based on a sanctioning institution to overcome the free rider problem.

In two experiments we find that once removed, reward systems, like punishment systems, reduced trust to levels below a control group who never experienced sanctions. This research highlights the detrimental effects of punishment and reward systems on intragroup trust and thus shows that while reward systems can generate the same positive effects as punishment systems, they also generate the same negative side effects.

The ability to infer others’ beliefs, desires, and intentions from their facial expressions should be especially important in interdependent decision making when people make decisions from beliefs about the others’ intention to cooperate. Five experiments tested the general proposition that people follow principles of appraisal when making inferences from emotion displays, in context. Experiment 1 revealed that the same emotion display produced opposite effects depending on context: When the other was competitive, a smile on the other’s face evoked a more negative response than when the other was cooperative. Experiment 2 revealed that the essential information from emotion displays was derived from appraisals (e.g., Is the current state of affairs conducive to my goals? Who is to blame for it?); facial displays of emotion had the same impact on people’s decision making as textual expressions of the corresponding appraisals. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 used multiple mediation analyses and a causal-chain design: Results supported the proposition that beliefs about others’ appraisals mediate the effects of emotion displays on expectations about others’ intentions. We suggest a model based on appraisal theories of emotion that posits an inferential mechanism whereby people retrieve, from emotion expressions, information about others’ appraisals, which then lead to inferences about others’ mental states.

Human experiments and artificial simulations of The Farmers are used to investigate the differences between how players and simulated agents act when given collaborative, competitive, and semi-cooperative/independent goals, (goals where players have personal goals not directly tied to the success of other players). Moral discussions from the game are analyzed using Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt, 2012) and Kohlberg's Theory of Moral development (Kohlberg, 1973, 1981). Findings suggest differences among the three versions of the game (collaborative, competitive, and independent versions) and evidence that a variety of moral foundations are used by players to explain and justify their actions during game play, especially when players are given independent goals. This is likely at least in part due to the independent goals design of the game, which emphasizes zero-sum success for individual players while at the same time fostering non-zero sum interaction among players. This study presents a methodology for designing simulation games to present goals found in non-competitive, non-cooperative interactions (such as goals found in many ecological and political debates). This study finds that sanctity is one of several moral foundations used to provide justification of anomalous actions in social dilemma game play. The study should be of interest to anyone wishing to design games-based studies of collaboration and negotiation for business, social science, and education that are rich with moral claims.

The present experiments examine this conflict in a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma game. Versus tit for tat, cooperation corresponds to self-control; defection, always immediately reinforced, corresponds to impulsiveness. Three experiments examined sensitivity of behavior to the global reinforcement contingency imposed by tit for tat. Undergraduates played a five-player prisoner's dilemma game against four dummy players programmed to play tit for tat or randomly. With tit for tat, a player's cooperation (or defection) increased dummy players' cooperation (or defection) on subsequent trials--reinforcing cooperation and punishing defection in the long run. Participants cooperated at a higher rate when the dummy players played tit for tat than when the dummy players played randomly. These results are consistent with findings in corresponding studies of self-control. Some participants, caught in a trap of mutual defection with the tit-for-tat playing dummy players, came to cooperate when the tit-for-tat contingency was reset ('forgiving' participants' previous defections) during a pause in the game. This increase was a result of the combined effects of a pause and reset; neither pausing nor resetting independently resulted in an increase in cooperation.

Using an innovative tournament approach, Axelrod found that a simple strategy, tit-for-tat (TFT), was most successful in playing the repeated prisoner's dilemma (PD) in a noiseless environment. However, recent analytical work has shown that monitoring problems caused by noise significantly impair TFT's effectiveness. The primary purpose of the present research is to discover whether there exist alternative strategies that perform well in noisy PDs. To investigate this question, the authors conducted a computer tournament The results of the tournament demonstrated that, consistent with analytical work, TFT performed rather poorly. In contrast, strategies that were generous (i.e., cooperated more than their partners did) were quite effective.

Because defect yields a better payoff whichever strategy an opponent chooses, it is rational for an agent to choose defect in a single game or a finite number of games. However, it is known that a pair of cooperates can also be a Nash equilibrium pair if the players do not know when the game is over or the game is infinitely repeated. To investigate such cooperative behavior, we employ an artificial social model called the Sugarscape and carry out simulations on the model. Arranging three kinds of environments in the Sugarscape, we examine cooperative behavior of agents who are essentially selfish, in a sense that they maximize their payoffs, and investigate influence of environmental changes on the cooperative behavior.

In theory, RTS is difficult to exploit because it begins with a small investment in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). When its cooperation is reciprocated, RTS increases its generosity, thereby taking advantage of cooperative opportunities. Previous research has shown that human participants indeed adopt RTS but start out moderately cooperative rather than with a minimal investment. This raises the question how robust RTS is against exploitation, especially in a noisy situation. We investigate whether human participants vary their cooperation in interaction with reciprocators and cheaters in an iterated nondiscrete version of a PDG. When confronted with a strategy that matches the investment of the participant on the previous round, we find that participants are likely to increase cooperation. However, cooperation gradually breaks down in interaction with a strategy that undercuts the level of cooperation of the participants, indicating the robustness of RTS. In line with RTS modeling studies, but in contrast with the cheater detection literature, we find that human participants are less willing to increase cooperation when the perceived likelihood of mistakes increases.

In six studies that use the PD/D design, we find that the players of PD/D consistently achieve very high cooperation rates, sometimes mean cooperation rates of about 95%, which are higher than in standard PD games sharing similar design features. These findings demonstrate that separating trust from cooperation is critical for building trust relations.

In this game, pigeons had a choice between cooperation and defection. Choices were reinforced according to a random-ratio schedule. In Experiment 1, the amount of reinforcement depended on the last two (reinforced or unreinforced) choices: defections preceded by cooperations produced the largest amount, the reverse sequence produced the smallest amount, and two cooperations in a row produced a larger amount than two defections in a row. Cooperation consisted of pecking on one of two response keys (left or right); pecking the other key was defection. Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1, but payoffs consisted of various delays to fixed amounts of food; cooperation and defection were defined as pecking on a symbol that could be projected on either the left or the right response key. Experiment 3 was similar to Experiment 2, but now the alternatives consisted of 'staying' (cooperating or defecting) or 'changing over' (from cooperation to defection, or vice-versa), and choices were effective only once every 1.3-s. In one condition, the color of the keys indicated whether a response on that key constituted a cooperation or a defection, and in a separate condition (also included in Experiment 1), the color of both keys indicated what the just-previous choice was. Results suggest that, contrary to previous evidence, pigeons may learn to cooperate in a prisoner's dilemma game when playing against tit-for-tat, and that the role of previous-choice signals is modulated by the parameters that define the payoff matrix.

Phase I involved each six-person group splitting up into two three-person teams.

The goal manipulation did not lead to a difference in team learning behaviors (defined as Experimenting, Seeking Information, Asking Questions, Seeking Feedback, and Discussing Errors), nor to a difference in an overall team learning measure. Further, the manipulation did not result in different levels of team effectiveness. However, the manipulation did lead to self-reported differences in a desire to work together in the future, confusion during the murder mystery game, satisfaction with the game outcome, and satisfaction with their experience as a team member. The difficulty of testing a team learning model with newly formed vs. intact teams is discussed. The importance of individual differences, or a personality variable, is discussed as a potential covariate in a model of team learning. More research is needed to determine the necessary environmental and personality influences that create an abundance of Team Learning Behaviors. In today's fast paced market, the existence of Team Learning Behaviors may be the only sustainable source of competitive advantage.

The experiment tested four game matrices, called the cooperate only, defect only, prisoner's dilemma, and opponent control treatments. This study found little cooperation in the defect only and prisoner's dilemma treatments. Cooperation occurred significantly more often in the opponent control treatment. These findings suggest that the jays attend to short-term consequences; they do not cooperate in the absence of an immediate benefit (defect only), even if a long-term benefit may exist (prisoner's dilemma). The opponent control treatment suggests that cooperation can occur when an individual's benefits depend completely on the actions of others; therefore, generosity is cheap. This study, therefore, agrees with recent studies in proposing alternative models of cooperation.

We investigated the relationship between mentalising and decision-making in the prisoner's dilemma in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), who show impaired mentalising, and normal adults. After completion of three versions of the prisoner's dilemma, we conducted a semi-structured interview. This interview attempted to elicit a participant's spontaneous strategy when playing each version of the game, as well as on their conception of the nature and strategy choice of their opponents (human vs. computer). Contrary to expectations, the behavioural choices of the adults with and without ASD were quantitatively similar, as were the qualitative responses to questions used in the interview. The consistency of the evidence from both measures suggests that mentalising ability was not involved in selecting the choices made in these prisoner's dilemma tasks. Instead they suggest the hypothesis that a purely logical strategy may have been adopted. The introspections of at least a subgroup of high-functioning individuals with ASD can on the whole be trusted and this use of mixed methods strengthens the validity of the conclusions drawn.

We define the relationship between two distinct brain regions by measures of functional connectivity and ascendancy. After assessing the relationship between all pairs of brain voxels, we are able to construct hierarchical functional networks from any given brain region and assess significant functional connectivity and ascendancy in these networks. We illustrate the use of our connectivity analysis using data from an fMRI study of social cooperation among women who played an iterated 'Prisoner's Dilemma' game. Our analysis reveals a functional network that includes the amygdala, anterior insula cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex, and another network that includes the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior insula.

Meanwhile, humans are known to show a social stress response during face-to-face social interactions, which might affect economic behaviors. Furthermore, it is known that there are individual differences in a social stress response, which might be reflected in individual differences in various types of economic behaviors, partially via different capacities of social memory. In the present study, we investigated the acute effects of social stress-induced free cortisol (a stress hormone) elevation on hippocampus-dependent social memory by utilizing the Trier social stress test (consisting of a public speech and a mental arithmetic task). We also examine the correlation between an economic behavior-related personality trait (i.e., general trust scale) and social stress-induced cortisol elevations. We found that (1) social stress acutely impairs social memory during social interaction and (2) interpersonal trust reduces social stress response. Together, interpersonal trust may modulate economic behaviors via stress hormone's action on social cognition-related brain regions.

In this study, we predicted that trust would play a 'signaling' role in promoting mutual cooperation, even in relationships with unfixed or temporary partners. To examine this prediction, we conducted an experiment using two different games. We used the repeated PD/D (prisoner's dilemma with choice of dependence) game, which can measure trusting behavior independently from cooperation. Also, we used the ordinary PD game in which there is no option for trust. Seventy participants were assigned to either the PD/D condition or the ordinary PD condition. In both conditions, players interacted with a randomly matched partner in each trial. The results reveal that the cooperation rate in the PD/D game was significantly higher than that in the PD game. Such a finding indicates that trust serves as a signal of the player's intention, which in turn, promotes mutual cooperation. However, in a similar experiment in which players interacted with the same partner, Matsuda & Yamagishi (2001) found a much lower cooperation rate in the PD/D condition than what was found in this experiment. Therefore, we conclude that the role of trust in non-fixed relationships has only a limited effect for promoting mutual cooperation.

The hypothetical model of interpersonal trust that is popular in management science includes specific trust, which is particular to the situation, task and person to be trusted, and general trust, which is a stable personality factor. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of general trust by addressing two questions: first, how does a person make decisions to trust or withhold trust from a stranger and, second, does a person's level of general trust affect his trust-related decision-making process and, if so, how? General trust was conceived and operationalized as comprising two factors, dispositional trust and caution. Designed as an exploratory study, with a theoretical sample of fifteen graduate students, the investigation employed the Problem-Centered Interview, a grounded theory method. In a laboratory setting, each participant was interviewed while he played the Trust Game, a sequential-play version of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, with a partner whom he had no opportunity to meet or communicate with other than to signal his moves in the game. Each participant played two games, each with a different partner. Pre- and post-test questionnaires, including a general trust instrument, provided complementary data on the participants' levels of dispositional trust and caution, goals, demographics and other relevant factors. The study produced an intricate set of data which was organized into a structural model of the general trust-based decision-making process. When examined on a case-by-case basis, the data showed that the high-, medium- and low-trusters differed in how they conceived the situation, what considerations were important to them, what meanings they construed from the information available, what decisions they made and how they behaved. These factors clustered into four identifiable approaches to decision-making that were characteristic of participants with different levels of trust. Overall, the findings of the study suggest that an individual's level of general trust has a far greater influence on his decision-making behavior than has been supposed or concluded in most organizational trust research. This has implications for future research, management education and organizational practice.

Greater activity in social cognition leads women to make decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make a decision by complying with the social norm.

These games provide a valuable opportunity to generate measures of cooperation that can be compared from one place to the next, yet challenges remain in how to interpret cross-cultural differences in these experiments and connect them to cooperation in naturally occurring contexts. I address these challenges by examining framing effects in public goods games (PGGs) with salmon fishers and reindeer herders in Kamchatka, Russia. Combining standard versions of the game with versions that refer to post-Soviet institutions coordinating fishing and herding, I show that (1) average contributions in the PGG in Kamchatka are substantially higher than reported elsewhere and (2) framing the PGG alters the relationship between contributions and expectations, shifting strategies away from unconditional generosity and toward conditional cooperation. My analysis, by synthesizing quantitative analysis of PGG data with long-term qualitative ethnography, including extensive postgame interviews with participants, supports the notion that cooperation in economic games increases along with cultural norms, values, and institutions that emerge from economic interdependence. Framing effects suggest that researchers should devote more attention to investigating the relationship between contributions and expectations.

However, to fully explain the effect of punishment on cooperation, it is important to understand the psychological mechanisms influencing the behaviour of those who expect to be punished. This paper examines whether the expectation of punishment, rather than the implementation of punishment is sufficient to prevent individuals from free riding. Individual differences in the punishment sensitivity have been linked to both threat responses (flight, fight, fear system, or the FFFS) and to the response to the uncertainty of punishment (BIS-anxiety).The paper, therefore, examines if individual differences in BIS-anxiety and FFFS can explain some of the variability in free riding in the face of implemented and non-implemented punishment. Methods: Participants took part in a series of one-shot Public Goods Games (PGGs) facing two punishment conditions (implemented and non-implemented) and two standard non-punishment PGGs. The punishment was implemented as a centralized authority punishment (i.e., if one participant contributed less than their group members, they were automatically fined). Individual contribution levels and presence/absence of zero contributions indexed free riding. Individual differences in behavioural inhibition were assessed. Results: Individuals contributed more under the threat of punishment (both implemented and non-implemented). However, individuals contributed less when the punishment was not implemented compared to when it was. Those scoring high in BIS-anxiety contributed more when the punishment expectations were not implemented. This effect was not observed for FFFS. Conclusion: Supporting previous research, punishment had a powerful effect in increasing contribution levels in the PGGs. However, when expected punishment was not implemented, individual differences in punishment sensitivity, specifically in BIS-anxiety, were related to fewer contributions (increased free riding) as compared to the situation when punishment was not implemented. This has implications for our understanding of why some people cannot resist the temptation to free ride, even when facing possible punishment for their actions. Our findings suggest that the diminished functioning of mechanisms, associated with trait behavioural inhibition, can partly explain such behaviours.

However, most of the studies were limited to simplified cognitive tests or computerized choice games that exclude real social interaction. The aim of the current study was to investigate human strategies based on the incentives and particularly the cognitive and emotional motivations of free riding. We examined the decision patterns of 41 healthy subjects (HSs) and 37 schizophrenia patients (SZ) during the public goods game (PGG), one of the games simulating human cooperation and free riding in group interactions. Strategic decision processes during the iterative binary PGG were assessed in terms of cognitive understanding, loss sensitivity, and TOM. We found that greed and loss sensitivity both motivated free-riding behavior in the HS, but that they were more vulnerable to greedy incentives than to possible loss. More significantly, the SZ clearly displayed a lower prevalence of free riding and distinct decision patterns from HS. Nonstrategic and unexpectedly low free ridings in the SZ likely arise from poor integration of cognitive and affective information. We suggest that loss sensitivity and TOM as well as cognitive understanding are involved in regulation of the free riding and cooperative behavior.

However, this approach relies on the implicit assumption that individuals are rational and fully aware of the consequences of their decisions. We examined behaviour in a standard economic game that is often used to measure social preferences: the public-goods game. We found that giving information to individuals about the relative success of their group led to (1) significantly higher levels of cooperation and (2) emotional responses to group success. This is despite the fact that group success had no effect on the payoffs in our game, and so knowledge of group success should not influence the behaviour of rational players. Consequently, these results suggest that cues of group competition have an automatic or unconscious effect on human behaviour that can induce increased within-group cooperation. More generally, this framing effect emphasizes the potential problem with drawing biological conclusions from the quantitative comparison of cooperation levels in economic games with the predictions of theory. Instead, our results emphasize the advantage of testing theory by qualitatively comparing behaviour across treatments, and with regard to expected adaptations and expected ontogeny.

Simple heterogeneity has one individual in a group having either greater endowment of resources or a greater preference for the public good than the others. Complex heterogeneity has one individual in a group having both higher endowment and greater preference for the public good. Without communication, members of heterogeneous groups tend to coordinate more on equal contribution shares than predicted by the conventional public goods model but consistent with a model incorporating a preference for equity. The distribution of relative contributions and total payoffs within groups exhibit strong interactions between communication and heterogeneity, leading to less equitable distributions of payoffs as heterogeneity becomes more complex.

In response, free riders are often moralized, becoming targets of negative moral judgments, anger, ostracism, or punishment. Moralization can change free riders’ behavior (e.g., encouraging them to contribute or discouraging them from taking future benefits) or it can motivate others, including moralizers, to avoid or exclude free riders; these effects of moralization are critical to sustaining human cooperation. Based on theories of error management and fundamental social domains from evolutionary psychology, we propose that the decision to moralize is a cue-driven process. One cue investigated in past work is observing a person illicitly consume collective benefits. Here, we test whether the mind uses a 2nd cue: merely opting out of contributing. Use of this cue creates a phenomenon of preventive moralization: moralization of people who have not yet exploited collective benefits but who might—or might not—in the future. We tested for preventive moralization across 9 studies using implicit and explicit measures of moralization, a behavioral measure of costly punishment, mediation analyses of the underlying processes, and a nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 U.S. adults. Results revealed that merely opting out of contributing to the creation of exploitable collective benefits—despite not actually exploiting collective benefits—elicited moralization. Results further showed that preventive moralization is not due to the moralization of selfishness or deviance but instead follows from the uncertainty inherent in moralization decisions. These results imply that even people who will never exploit collective benefits can nonetheless be targets of moralization. We discuss implications for social and political dynamics.

Rather, our results suggest that in homogenous groups, observable racial identity may convey information about heterogeneity in other dimensions, especially where race is highly correlated with diversity in other dimensions, such as linguistic diversity, low intra-group trust and socio-economic need. Thus, racial identity loses its salience in the absence of any visibly identifiable out-group members, but other dimensions of identity increase their salience. Moreover, while communication has a large and significant positive effect on contributions to the public pool, patterns of communication are affected by the racial composition of the group.

We apply a mechanism used successfully in continuous public goods games, the Hired Gun Mechanism (Andreoni and Gee in J. Public Econ. 96(11–12):1036–1046, 2012), to see if it can successfully get subjects across the threshold. When we use the mechanism to eliminate only inefficient equilibria, without addressing coordination, there is a modest but statistically insignificant improvement with the mechanism. However, when we hone the mechanism to eliminate all but one of the provision-point equilibria, thereby addressing the coordination issue, the mechanism moves all subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost immediately. In fact, after only one round using the hired gun mechanism, all subject are coordinating on the chosen equilibrium. The mechanism can be applied in settings where a group (1) has a plan for public good provision, (2) can measure contributions, (3) can fine members and (4) has an agreed upon standard for expected contributions. In these settings simple punishments, when focused on solving coordination as well as free riding, can greatly improve efficiency.

Subjects reward group members who have previously been generous to them and withhold rewards from ungenerous group members. Strategic concerns cannot explain all of this behavior, and it must be at least partly due to direct reciprocity. When someone cannot directly benefit from favor trading, he gives much less to the public good. People thus excluded from the 'circle of reciprocity' provide a clean and strict test of indirect reciprocity. Contrary to previous studies in the literature, we do not observe indirect reciprocity.

We find the highest levels of prosociality in our world sample. The striking finding from these games is that this rural U.S. population demonstrated consistently high prosociality across all measures in all games: offers, returns, and rejections of low offers at cost to the individual. Indeed, in the DG (mean offer = 47 percent) and the UG (mean offer = 48 percent), because there was virtually no variation in offer behavior, it is not possible to test for any demographic effects. Consistent with the high prosocial behavior that we observe in the offers across all four games, we also find high rejection rates in the strategy method UG, with close to 30 percent of the sample rejecting offers of 40 percent. From the PG, we see overall high offers (mean = 62 percent), and perhaps even more impressive, 36 percent of the population contributed 100 percent of their stake to the common pot. In the trust game, we have evidence of both considerable trust (high player 1 offers of 63 percent) and considerable trustworthiness (high player 2 returns of 173 percent). These findings are particularly interesting because they come from a rural population of relatively modest economic means: 12 percent of the sample had household incomes below the U.S. poverty line. Given that this rural Missouri population is also in the midwestern Bible Belt, with near-universal belief in a world religion, these findings are directly in line with the overall results of this volume. This population has highly developed market institutions, its religious orientation is toward a world religion, and it demonstrated consistently high prosociality across a range of diverse experiments.

The experimental results are; (i) Reward options yield lower contributions than punishment through exclusion, (ii) Endogenous leadership is much more efficient than exogenously imposed leadership, (iii) Having sequential contributions of group members is not beneficial in itself for contributions since groups where the leader contributes as the last member do not contribute more than groups without a leader. As such, these results illuminate the relative benefits of reward arid punishment as instruments for leaders. Yet, while these instruments seem to increase the hierarchical power of the leader, volunteering to be the leader of the group—thereby sacrificing own payoffs to achieve a common goal—seems to increase his persuasive, power to convince the followers to contribute to the public good.

Ecological concerns, a form of contributing to the public good, were positively related to age. Study 2 investigated whether these values are expressed behaviorally when participants solved a complex problem that allowed striving for monetary gains or contributing to a public good. Confirming hypotheses, young adults’ strategies were consistent with the aim of optimizing personal financial gain, and older adults’ strategies with the aim to contribute to the public good. Studies 3 and 4 showed that older adults were more likely than younger and middle-aged adults to donate money to a good cause than to keep it for themselves. Study 4 manipulated participants’ future time perspective as a factor potentially contributing to age-related differences. Partly confirming hypotheses, a longer time perspective reduced donations by older adults, but a shorter time perspective did not increase donations by younger adults. These studies suggest that older adults not only report valuing contributions to the public good more highly but also are more likely to behave altruistically than younger adults. All studies used cross-sectional designs that prevent a strict test of developmental trajectories but rather provide age-related differences at 1 point in time, representing a 1st step in investigating adult age-related differences in altruism.

We show that wealth visibility facilitates the downstream consequences of initial inequality—in initially more unequal situations, wealth visibility leads to greater inequality than when wealth is invisible. This result reflects a heterogeneous response to visibility in richer versus poorer subjects. We also find that making wealth visible has adverse welfare consequences, yielding lower levels of overall cooperation, inter-connectedness, and wealth.

We observe others, talk about others, and act accordingly. We help those who help others, and we cooperate expecting that others will cooperate in return. Indirect reciprocity is based on reputation, which spreads by communication. A crucial aspect of indirect reciprocity is observability: reputation effects can support cooperation as long as peoples' actions can be observed by others. In evolutionary models of indirect reciprocity, natural selection favors cooperation when observability is sufficiently high. Complementing this theoretical work are experiments where observability promotes cooperation among small groups playing games in the laboratory. Until now, however, there has been little evidence of observability's power to promote large-scale cooperation in real-world settings. Here we provide such evidence using a field study involving 2,413 subjects. We collaborated with a utility company to study participation in a program designed to prevent blackouts. We show that observability triples participation in this public goods game. The effect is nearly seven times larger than offering a $25 monetary incentive, the company's previous policy. Furthermore, as predicted by indirect reciprocity, we provide evidence that reputational concerns are driving our observability effect. In sum, we show how indirect reciprocity can be harnessed to increase cooperation in a relevant, real-world public goods game.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate some explanations for the effectiveness of a pledge in enhancing cooperation. 256 undergraduate students (in groups of four subjects) were asked to make choices in a public goods dilemma.

If cooperation can only be explained when it is self-interested then, absent mechanisms to make it so, people 'should' always defect. This prediction conflicts with one of the most robust findings in experimental social dilemma research: People often do cooperate absent incentive compatibility. This is frequently explained by claiming that the subjective ranking of dilemma outcomes can differ from the objective ranking of individual payoffs. According to a procedural conception of rationality, one's subjectively defined preferences, joined in a expected utility calculation with one's expectations of others' behavior, could yield rational cooperative choices absent incentive compatibility. I test this 'procedural rationality' model in two experimental studies of anonymous, one-shot prisoners' dilemma decision making. The procedural model is more accurate at predicting choices than more traditional rational choice approaches, but fails to account for a significant proportion of observed cooperation. The data show that this failure is the result of the model's mis-specification of the relationship between expectations of others' behavior and outcome evaluations. Specifically: (1) expectations of others' behavior affect cooperate vs. defect choices regardless of one's outcome aspirations, and (2) expectations and aspirations are interdependent decision factors--shifts in one lead to shifts in the other. Taken together, these two findings draw a picture of values in interdependent interaction, not as exogenous and stable, but as constructed by, and adaptive to perception of the social environment.

We argue that this cooperation is dependent on adaptive aspirations and an increased willingness to consider alternative courses of action in light of declining sales within an industry. Three experiments are reported that tested these ideas. In each study, Ss assigned to 4-person groups chose how many resources to contribute to a generic advertising campaign, the effectiveness of which depended on total funding levels. Each group member represented a different 'store' in the same mall. The instructions framed the problem by presenting varying sales trends for the stores--Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Ss confronting the declining trend contributed significantly more than those in either of the other 2 conditions. A declining sales trend also positively influenced their expectations that others would contribute as well. The third experiment demonstrated that a decline-induced equilibrium persisted over trials of a finitely repeated game with a known stopping point. Surprisingly, the specific identification of a competitor mall as the cause of the decline in sales actually resulted in lower levels of contribution.

In line with this, it was hypothesized that high perceived criticality activates feelings of social responsibility (which includes an other-oriented approach) and in turn influences contributions. Across 3 studies, in a sample of male and female college students, using a linear public good dilemma, a step-level dilemma with different monetary endowments, and a sequential step-level dilemma, supportive evidence for this hypothesis was found.

Previous research has shown that strengthening group identity promotes cooperation. One explanation for this finding is that a strong group identity transforms people's motives from the personal to the collective level (the goal transformation hypothesis). Evidence for this hypothesis can be found in studies showing that a strong sense of group identity influences proselfs, relative to prosocials, to make larger contributions. In this experiment, the authors, with 142 subjects (Ss; mean age 19.07 yrs), demonstrated that these findings are restricted to situations in which no feedback about a group's performance is provided. When performance feedback is provided, a strong group identity cancels the effects of individual differences in social value orientations. In particular, when a group fails, contributions increase if group identity is salient, but decrease if personal identity is salient, regardless of a person's social value orientation. But when a group succeeds, no differences between group and personal identity are found.

It was expected that a charismatic leader would be able to transform people's motives beyond self-interest, consequently increasing cooperation. This transformation effect was expected to occur among individuals aimed at maximizing their own self-interest (i.e., pro-selfs), but not among those aimed at maximizing joint or collective outcomes (i.e., pro-socials). Leader's charisma was experimentally manipulated by means of describing the leader as either self-sacrificing or benefiting. 104 male and 79 female students (mean age 19.11 yrs) participated. The results revealed that self-sacrificing leaders, contrary to benefiting leaders, were perceived as more charismatic and were able to motivate decision-makers to cooperate more. The latter effect appeared to be more pronounced among pro-selfs rather than pro-socials, as such supporting the transformational idea of charismatic leaders. Further results showed that this behavioral effect was mediated by perceptions of legitimacy.

The game matrix is transformed into a zero-sum game matrix that for each player reflects the strategic elements of the original game as modified by the degree of altruism he may feel toward his opponent. The transformation consists of adding to a player's payoffs those of his opponent multiplied by a factor designated as the player's 'altruism parameter.' 3 sets of assumptions are considered in order to make predictions about the play of the game to differing degrees of detail. Results of the analysis include qualitative and quantitative measures of conflict inherent in a PD game, estimates of the distribution of the altruism parameter among players, and qualitative predictions concerning the dynamics of play when interactive changes of altruism occur.

Support was obtained for the hypothesis that consistent behavior by A yields more information and consensus than does inconsistent behavior. Partial support was found for the hypotheses that (a) consistent disagreement with B yields greater information than consistent agreement, and (b) inconsistency that constitutes an 'initiative' or shift away from B yields greater information than inconsistency that constitutes an 'imitative' shift toward B.

There was a 3-factor interaction effect with the description of the feedback and the trial block of the game. Ss tended to decrease cooperation over trial blocks. The act of prediction reduced this effect for Ss who thought they faced a preset computer sequence but not for those attempting to predict the moves of a human adversary.

Although the focus was on the applicability of the research tool to the population studied, 3 hypotheses guided the specific design: (1) cooperative behavior would be a linear function of a ratio of differences between payoff values; (2) a cooperative response that involved turning toward the other player would not differ from a cooperative response that involved turning away from the other player; and (3) males would cooperate more often than females. Although Hypothesis 1 was disconfirmed, it was found that it was easier to 'forgive' someone for an injury incurred or to 'repent' for an insult rendered if the person is nearby but is not faced and not seen. Females were generally more cooperative than males. It is concluded that the modified version of the PDG is applicable to a preadolescent population and could become an important tool for the study of the developmental aspects of social conflict.

Norman Jr. and  Weil, Harrison G.","A symbolic interactionist view of experimental situations suggests that Ss behave to create favorable situated identities in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG). The goal-structure of the PDG, being ambiguous, can lead Ss to play for diverse purposes: to select different strategies to become 'good players,' or to define moves as expressive of their dispositional qualities as 'good persons.' An experiment was designed to manipulate goal-ambiguity and the dispositional inferences implied by different choices. Players saw a hypothetical game between Al and Bob, whom they characterized on 2 adjective check-lists, 1 of which favored competitive 'player' qualities, while the other valued cooperative 'person' qualities. Ss then played the game, as had their Al and Bob examples, for either points or pennies. Both incentive and list conditions affected cooperative rates as anticipated, but unexpected interactions appeared. Apparently, the meaning of play-moves changed substantially by condition and also varied differentially within conditions. These variations in the situational meaning of behaviors are thought to occur routinely in the PDG and other laboratory studies. They imply a need to revise traditional design and measurement procedures in social psychological experimentation. (3 p. ref.)

According to the theory, a persuasive message will influence a player's behavioral intention, and hence his behavior, only if it affects either his attitude toward the act (A-act) and/or his normative beliefs (i.e., his perception of the other player's expectations) multiplied by his motivation to comply with the norms, expressed algebraically as NBs (Mcs). Persuasive messages were directed at either A-act or NBs. Orthogonal to the message type, 2 motivational orientations were created, cooperation and competition. Consistent with earlier findings, A-act was found to be more important than NBs (Mcs) in predicting behavioral intentions and behavior under competition, but less important than NBs (Mcs) under cooperation. Results also support the hypothesis that the attitudinal message would change behavior more effectively in the competitive situation, while the normative message would be more effective in cooperative groups.

The false feedback condition using a strategy which matched S's own level of coopertaion was significantly more conducive to cooperation than a contrasted group of natural pairs.

In Exp I, an escalatory (increasing) pattern of threats and punishments was employed, and in Exp II, a deescalatory (decreasing) pattern was used. Escalation and deescalation were implemented noncontingently by robot, or gradually and contingent on target's response to previous influence exertion. Escalation of punishments was far more effective in eliciting compliance overall than was deescalation; these differences persisted within both the sudden and gradual conditions.

Many people believe that the solution to global warming will require some form of structural solution. A structural solution transforms a social dilemma so that cooperation is viewed as a more viable option. The purpose of the current study was to examine how mood would affect cooperation and willingness to give up free access in favor of a structural solution within a resource dilemma. Two hundred fifteen undergraduate students were randomly assigned to the 4 (Mood: anger, sadness, happiness, control) X 2 (Use: Optimal Use versus Overuse) between participants design. Cooperation was measured within a 10-trial resource dilemma, and their attributions for the success or failure of the resource were assessed. Finally, they were given the opportunity to vote to play a second round of the game using the status quo or one of three structural solutions: Harvest Cap, Leader, Computer Monitoring System. Results were largely inconclusive. Although well-validated mood manipulations were employed, the manipulations were largely ineffective at producing the desired moods. Mood did not have the predicted effect on cooperation or willingness to adopt a structural solution. There was a main effect of use on cooperation, indicating that those participants who experienced a rapidly depleting resource cooperated more (consumed less) than when the resource was being optimally used. Measured mood (particularly sadness) predicted willingness to adopt a structural solution. Discussion focuses on why the mood manipulation was largely ineffective and possible reasons for the lack of support for the predictions. Future studies should use a mood manipulation that connects more strongly to the dilemma situation, and measure consequential changes in both processing and behavior.

Simple Markov models are proposed as random player models, providing a common metric and framework within which to compare the performance of human agents in maintaining a resource with exogenous dynamics.

Four novel structural solutions were employed in the current research and people's preferences for and the evaluation of these solutions were assessed. People most preferred the option in which a computer monitored the resource and allowed or restricted people's access to the resource. Furthermore, people judged this option as being the most attractive option. There was no effect on preferences for a structural solution option based on the certain or uncertain nature of the resource. The perceived fairness of the method of choosing a structural solution, that is, command-and-control versus public participation, was also under investigation. People found the participatory method fairer than the command-and-control method. Additionally, those certain about the resource found the participatory method fairer than those who were uncertain about the resource. Another goal of the current study was to investigate the bias toward optimism when the resource was uncertain or certain and its effects on consumption. People were less optimistic about the size of the resource when the resource was uncertain rather than certain and, overall, people were more optimistic about their own ability to manage the resource than others' abilities to manage it. This finding was independent of the certain or uncertain nature of the resource. Furthermore, having greater optimism in one's ability to manage the resource significantly predicted greater resource use. Finally, because the paradigm employed in this study defined environmental uncertainty as providing no information about the size of the resource, it was of interest to investigate resource consumption rates. Contrary to predictions and past research, people who were uncertain about the resource initially consumed less than those who were certain about the resource and significantly increased their consumption through time. These results can contribute to the social dilemmas literature as well as inform public policy.

A self-interest vs community perspective is offered to explain individuals' decision making in resource dilemmas. The self-interest model assumes that users seek to maximize their personal benefits regardless of the collective implications. To foster sustainable use, it is necessary to restrict people's access to the resource either through controlling the resource centrally (centralization) or by creating a system of individual access (individualization). The alternative community model suggests that communities can foster self-restraint among users provided that they fell attached to their community. These 2 perspectives and their implications for natural resource management are systematically compared using findings from research on water conservation.

Current theories of sex differences in social behavior suggest that it
may be useful to examine in what situations men and women are likely to
differ in cooperation. Here, we derive predictions from both
sociocultural and evolutionary perspectives on context-specific sex
differences in cooperation, and we conduct a unique meta-analytic study
of 272 effect sizes sampled across 50 years of research on social
dilemmas to examine several potential moderators. The overall average
effect size is not statistically different from zero (d = -0.05),
suggesting that men and women do not differ in their overall amounts of
cooperation. However, the association between sex and cooperation is
moderated by several key features of the social context: Male male
interactions are more cooperative than female female interactions (d =
0.16), yet women cooperate more than men in mixed-sex interactions (d =
-0.22). In repeated interactions, men are more cooperative than women.
Women were more cooperative than men in larger groups and in more recent
studies, but these differences disappeared after statistically
controlling for several study characteristics. We discuss these results
in the context of both sociocultural and evolutionary theories of sex
differences, stress the need for an integrated biosocial approach, and

indeed, OXT may impede trust and pro-social behavior depending on
chronic interpersonal insecurities, and/or possible neurochemical

showing that workers have upward-sloping labor supply curves. Finally,
we analyze the challenges to online experiments, proposing methods to

robust tendency for cooperation. However, part- or indeed all-of this
cooperativeness may be due to socially desirable responding. To address
this problem, we propose and apply a new approach for the unbiased
measurement of cooperativeness in social dilemma games. Specifically, we
employ an extension of the randomized-response technique (RRT). The RRT
protects the privacy of respondents by adding random noise to their
responses. It thus encourages more honest responding and thereby
provides less biased estimates of sensitive attributes. In a large-scale
study with 2043 respondents we maximized anonymity in a one-shot
prisoner's dilemma game through use of the RRT. Comparing the prevalence
rates for cooperation obtained via the RRT with those from direct
self-report showed that traditional direct questioning formats
overestimate cooperation rates, with a relative bias of 18\%. This
finding suggests that to a considerable extent, self-reported
cooperation is due to socially desirable responding, rather than actual
cooperativeness. However, our results also demonstrate that cooperation
remains substantial even under conditions of maximized anonymity.

rewards typically use smaller real rewards than those common in real
life. When laboratory rewards are large, they are almost always
hypothetical. In applying laboratory results meaningfully to real-life
situations, it is important to know the extent to which choices among
hypothetical rewards correspond to choices among real rewards and
whether variation of the magnitude of hypothetical rewards affects
behavior in meaningful ways. The present study compared real and
hypothetical monetary rewards in two experiments. In Experiment 1,
participants played a temporal discounting game that incorporates the
logic of a repeated prisoner's-dilemma (PD) game versus tit-for-tat;
choice of one alternative ({''}defection{''} in PD terminology) resulted
in a small-immediate reward; choice of the other alternative
({''}cooperation{''} in PD terminology) resulted in a larger reward
delayed until the following trial. The larger-delayed reward was greater
for half of the groups than for the other half. Rewards also differed in
type across groups: multiples of real nickels, hypothetical nickels, or
hypothetical hundred-dollar bills. All groups significantly increased
choice of the larger delayed reward over the 40 trials of the
experiment. Over the last 10 trials, cooperation was significantly
higher when the difference between larger and smaller hypothetical
rewards was greater. Reward type (real or hypothetical) made no
significant difference in cooperation on most measures. In Experiment 2,
real and hypothetical rewards were compared in social discounting-the
decrease in value to the giver of a reward as social distance increases
to the receiver of the reward. Social discount rates were well described
by a hyperbolic function. Discounting rates for real and hypothetical
rewards did not significantly differ. These results add to the evidence
that results of experiments with hypothetical rewards validly apply in
everyday life.}",article,ISI:000294456500005,{6},,{SOC JUDGMENT \& DECISION MAKING},,,{2020-11-05},{DOAJ Gold},{ISI:000294456500005},{814LV},{Judgm. Decis. Mak.},{37},{1},{73},{31},,"{NIDA NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health \& Human ServicesNational

develop a model that allows for both assortment and conflict between

assortment and conflict allow for the evolution of both indiscriminate

parochialists over altruists, as the latter waste help on outgroup
members. We use computer simulations to study the multilevel selection
dynamics. The simulation model describes an absorbing Markov chain. We
examine the absorption probabilities of altruists and parochialists.
Three model versions are compared, with only assortment, with only group
conflict, and with both mechanisms. We find that parochialism is
selected for by group conflict as well as assortment. Discrimination

behavioral scientists provide different answers. To date, there is no
theoretical and/or quantitative review of rewards and punishments as

interdependence-theoretic framework, we propose that rewards and
punishments should both promote cooperation, and we identify 2
variables-cost of incentives and source of incentives-that are predicted
to magnify the effectiveness of these incentives in promoting
cooperation. A meta-analysis involving 187 effect sizes revealed that
rewards and punishments exhibited a statistically equivalent positive
effect on cooperation (d = 0.51 and 0.70, respectively). The
effectiveness of incentives was stronger when the incentives were costly
to administer, compared to free. Centralization of incentives did not
moderate the effect size. Punishments were also more effective during
iterated dilemmas when participants continued to interact in the same
group, compared to both (a) iterated dilemmas with reassignment to a new
group after each trial and (b) one-shot dilemmas. We also examine

incentives, regulations and social norms for the group of resource
users. Standard environmental economics has tended mostly to focus on
the material incentives and regulations that transform the relative
material costs and benefits of various/specific/certain actions.
However, there exist behavioral aspects and social norms that affect how
individuals value material and non-material incentives, and thus
determine their decision to either cooperate or over-extract resources
from a common-pool. This paper discusses the importance of social norms
in shaping behavior in the commons through the lens of experiments-in
particular, experiments conducted in the field with exactly those people
who usually face these social dilemmas in their daily lives. Using a
large sample of experimental sessions inclusive of around one thousand
people, both villagers and students, I test some hypotheses about
behavior in the commons, wherein regulations and social norms constrain
people's choices. The results suggest that people evaluate several
components of intrinsic and material motivations in deciding whether or
not to cooperate. While responding in the expected direction to an
imperfectly monitored fine for over extraction, the valuation of the
private net cost of violating the regulation is not a sufficient
explanation for participants' changes in behavior in the experiments.
Even when violations have zero cost, people may react positively to an
external regulator who issues a normative statement about a rule aimed
at solving a particular social dilemma.}",article,ISI:000288390100006,{3},,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000288390100006},{735CD},{Environ. Resour.

requires, to evolve, specialized cognitive abilities that most species
would not possess. In particular, memory would be important because
cooperation can emerge and be maintained only if the same opponents
interact repeatedly and adjust their decisions to their opponent's
previous move. To investigate how these constraints influence
reciprocity, we first conducted a preliminary foraging experiment with
zebra finches (Taeniapygia guttata) to insure that corticosterone
elevations impaired the birds' event memory capabilities. Then, we
performed a reciprocity experiment with established pairs that were
tested in a two-choice apparatus under two different conditions: once
with an empty implant and once with an implant of corticosterone. We
found that the birds were capable of sustained cooperation in the
Prisoner's Dilemma treatment but only when they had an empty implant.
Thus, our results support the hypothesis that limitations in event
memory constraint the frequency of reciprocity and hence would make this
form of cooperation difficult for non-human animals. In addition, as
levels of stress hormones can differ greatly among individuals, our
findings might also contribute explaining individual variation in the
propensity to cooperate.}",article,ISI:000285921900003,{2},,{WILEY},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000285921900003},{702UR},{Ethology},{37},{0},{13},{40},"{We thank two anonymous referees and Editor-in-chief David W. Zeh for

in all probability, of an effective management program. One of the most
important conservation measures is the V-notch program that allows
fishermen to conserve proven breeding females by notching the tails of
egg-bearing lobsters. Such marked lobsters may never be taken. Although
thousands of lobster fishermen participate, it is a voluntary practice.
The genesis of this practice is not easily explained, because V-notching
poses a prisoner's dilemma problem that gives fishermen an incentive to
avoid the practice. The most common explanations for ways to overcome
prisoner's dilemma problems will not work in the case of the V-notch. An
unusual combination of factors explains the V-notch program: (1) a
strong belief among those in the industry that the V-notch is effective
in conserving the lobster stock; (2) a low discount rate because the
long-term gains from V-notching are higher than the one-time gain from
defection; (3) a gain in reputation for those who V-notch. At the start
of the 20th century, fishermen did not V-notch; by the end of the
century, V-notching was common. We explain the change in strategies

which conditions participants' cooperation rates would either change due
to monetary value changes (e.g., 3 cents to 3 dollars) or not change due
to numeric value changes (e.g., 3 dollars to 300 cents). A total of 102
university students played the game against a computer that employed one
of four strategies across blocks. Results showed high rates of
cooperation when participants played against a tit-for-tat strategy and
low rates of cooperation against a random strategy. There was no change
in cooperation rates due to changes in numeric value alone and a
decrease in cooperation rates when large monetary values were at stake.
Cooperation rates were higher and cooperation responses slower at

self-deceive, are legacies of our evolutionary heritage. As a purposive
outgrowth of modularity, self-deception may serve to isolate threatening
thoughts from consciousness and facilitate cooperation. The primary goal
of the present investigation was to determine if individuals with
depression exhibit both low levels of self-deception and cooperation.
Relationships between the tendency to self-deceive and the conscious
attributions typical of depression or promoting cooperation were also
examined. Eighty undergraduate participants completed measures of
self-deception, impression management, depression, and attributional
styles. Cooperation was assessed by responses to social dilemmas based
on the prisoner's dilemma game. Results indicated that, as expected,
high self-deceivers cooperated more and exhibited lower levels of
depression than low self-deceivers. Self-deception scores were
significantly associated with several attributional styles but
independently predicted depressive symptomology. That individuals with
depression displayed both reduced levels of self-deception and
cooperation is discussed in light of several models of the evolutionary
significance of depression, especially E. H. Hagen's bargaining model of
depression {[}The functions of postpartum depression. Evolution and

demonstrated by our participants. Our results indicate that the

When demonstrability was high we found that groups showed no effect of

impede it. Insight into when distrusters may be prompted to cooperate
may therefore be of importance. Empirical studies point to several
moderators of the effect of trust on cooperation. Unfortunately, these
studies largely ignored the potential role of group member affect. Our
study shows that group members' affective displays (particularly the
activation level of the displays) have a substantial impact on the
relationship between trust and cooperation. First, a scenario experiment
(n=80) revealed that low trusting individuals were more willing to
cooperate when confronted with group members who display high (versus
low) activation affective states, whereas for more high trusting
individuals cooperation was not contingent on other group members'
affective displays. Second, a laboratory experiment (n=78), employing a
social dilemma paradigm, replicated these findings and indicated that
this effect is explained by the extent to which others are expected to
cooperate. The discussion focuses on theoretical implications and
managerial ramifications. Our study testifies to the significant role
that affect may play in keeping up cooperation in organizations and work

cooperate is perceived as less moral than a defector who expects others
to defect; a cooperator who expects others to defect is perceived as
less competent than a cooperator who expects others to cooperate

interdependence, a stated expectation that the behavior of others will
resemble one's own may protect one's social reputation. When outcomes
are not interdependent, expectations do not moderate the effects of
behavior on reputation (Experiment 2). In such a context, inductive
reasoning is sufficient to explain social projection. Both types of
results are replicated in a modified N-person social dilemma (Experiment

exposure to different hormones and symmetry, affect decision-making and
strategic behaviour. The present article investigates the effect of
symmetry, of exposure to testosterone (T) in utero and during puberty
and of current T on cooperation in a Prisoners' Dilemma Game (PDG). T is
a hormone with well known effect on males' behaviour, and that promotes
activities that seek to increase reproductive success. Fluctuating
Asymmetry (FA) reflects the ability of the organism to maintain a stable
development and it is usually employed as a variable reflecting genetic
quality (low FA values are thought to signal higher genetic quality).
Our results show that subjects with intermediate levels of second to
fourth digit ratio (a proxy of exposure to Tin utero) and with high FA
cooperate more often in the PDG. We also observe that the latter effect
is due to the fact that FA has an impact on subjects' expectations about
the behaviour of their counterpart in the game. These results reinforce
the described link between markers related to genetic quality and
cooperative behaviour. This possible linkage of individual condition and
pro-social behaviour in humans clearly merits further attention. (C)

economic games: a Coordination Game (with strong incentives to
cooperate) and a Prisoner's Dilemma (with weak cooperative incentives).
OT enhanced cooperation only when social information was present, and
this effect was significantly more pronounced in the Coordination Game.
When social information was lacking, OT surprisingly decreased
cooperation. Consistent with the well-established role of OT in
trust-building and in social cognition, social information appears to be
crucial for OT to boost cooperative expectations in an interdependent
social interaction that provides incentives to cooperate. When these
cues are absent, OT appears to instead elicit a risk-averse strategy.

P.","{Background: Game theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game in
particular, which captures the paradox of cooperative interactions that
lead to benefits but entail costs to the interacting individuals, have
constituted a powerful tool in the study of the mechanisms of
reciprocity. However, in non-human animals most tests of reciprocity in
PD games have resulted in sustained defection strategies. As a
consequence, it has been suggested that under such stringent conditions
as the PD game humans alone have evolved the necessary cognitive
abilities to engage in reciprocity, namely, numerical discrimination,
memory and control of temporal discounting.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We use an iterated PD game to test rats
(Rattus norvegicus) for the presence of such cognitive abilities by
manipulating the strategy of the opponent, Tit-for-Tat and
Pseudo-Random, or the relative size of the temptation to defect. We
found that rats shape their behaviour according to the opponent's
strategy and the relative outcome resulting from cooperative or
defective moves. Finally, we show that the behaviour of rats is
contingent upon their motivational state (hungry versus sated).
Conclusions/Significance: Here we show that rats understand the payoff
matrix of the PD game and the strategy of the opponent. Importantly, our
findings reveal that rats possess the necessary cognitive capacities for
reciprocity-based cooperation to emerge in the context of a prisoner's
dilemma. Finally, the validation of the rat as a model to study
reciprocity-based cooperation during the PD game opens new avenues of
research in experimental neuroscience.}",article,ISI:000273554600003,{1},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-05},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000273554600003},{543EV},{PLoS One},{21},{0},{36},{43},"{This work was supported by Fundacao Champalimaud, Instituto Gulbenkian

This is indeed consistent with the findings that are presented here for the Orma of East Africa. After highlighting aspects of pastoral-nomadic Orma life that mae be relevant to their behavior in experiments, the author discusses experimental methods. Results of the three games are consistent with general findings that shows fairness increasing with market integration. Something appears to trigger fair-mindedness in association with exposure to market institutions. Among those selling either their labor or their goods, there may be a higher premium placed upon reputation, and that one way of signaling a good reputation is to behave fair-mindedly. Eventually, this norm appears to be internalized, as is evident from its emergence in the anonymous, one-shot, economic experiments. This hypothesis warrants future replication in tightly controlled experiments with even more cross-cultural samples and also with cases similar to the Orma that offer a broad spectrum of variation in market integration within one society, thus helping to control for a vast array of potential confounds.

One salient feature that has been proposed as a possible explanation for cross-cultural differences in game behavior is the degree of market exposure and acculturation (Henrich 2000; Henrich et al., see record [rid]2005-01445-002[/rid]). This study therefore attempts to answer two questions: (1) Does Tsimane' game behavior differ from the standard results found among westernized, market-oriented, and industrialized populations? (2) Does differential exposure to competitive markets and an acculturated environment affect norms of fairness and game behavior across Tsimane' villages, or does a common Tsimane' identity and culture overshadow any differences due to acculturation? Offers in the Ultimatum Game tend to be lower than those found among western populations and higher than those reported for the Machiguenga, while contributions in the Public Goods Game tend to be higher than those reported for the Machiguenga, but within the range found among western populations. There is also a high level of variation in Ultimatum Game offers and Public Goods Game contributions by Tsimane' in comparison to standard western results. There are few differences in Ultimatum Game or Public Goods Game behavior that can be attributed to market exposure or acculturation, and the few differences that exist do not support the notion that exposure to modern markets produces game behavior similar to that found in the west. The strongest predictor of both individual Ultimatum Game and Public Goods Game behavior is village membership.

The majority of these studies examined appointment of an overall leader to manage individual resource consumption on behalf of the entire group, particularly after leaderless groups have proven unable to show restraint. In this research, more attention was given to the acceptability of appointing a leader as an overall intervention, and less to the factors influencing the leader's effectiveness. We are only beginning to gain insight into important determinants of leader behavior in intergroup settings--those in which there is more than one subunit, each with its own leader. The inspiration for the current research came from Foddy and Crettenden's (1994) investigation of subgroup leadership behavior in resource dilemmas, and the game theory research concerning the structure of intergroup conflict. The present research tests the prediction that increasing a leader's sense of accountability to the overall collective acts to constrain intergroup competition and conflict. Collective accountability promotes thinking about others and attempts to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, which should result in a relatively equal division of contested resources, and restraint in use of scarce resources. Accountability to one's more circumscribed membership group, however, should enhance relative gain or competition between subgroups. In the first study reported, we contrasted leaders who were responsible to no one, to a subgroup or to a superordinate group. In the second study, we compared leaders who were or were not accountable to subgroups, with nonleaders, who were also accountable (or not) for their decisions.

Chapter I contains a brief motivation and introduction. In chapters II and III, we analyze two non-cooperative methods for either enhancing or mitigating externality-causing activities. Chapter II deals with positive externality in the public good contribution context, and chapter III with negative externality in the pollution abatement context. Chapter IV contains an empirical analysis of charitable donations by the elderly. Chapter II models the so-called 'corporate challenge gift' used in real world fund-raising, and adopts the concept to voluntary contributions to public goods more generally. We model the process as a sequential game in public good contributions. One of the agents sets a quantity-contingent matching scheme to leverage higher contributions from the other players. Under the assumption that the preferences of agents are public information and the assumption that the scheme setter can commit to the matching plan, we show that the scheme brings efficient levels of total contributions to the public good. Chapter III applies some ideas from a joint work with Professor Robin Boadway and Professor Jean-Franois Tremblay on 'Commitment and Matching Contributions to Public Goods' to the issue of reducing negative externality-causing activity. In particular, it adapts both the Guttman-Danziger-Schnytzer type of rate-matching mechanism and the quantity-contingent matching method for public good contributions to the international pollution abatement problem. In a simple two-country model, we find that both matching schemes induce the countries to internalize the negative externality imposed on the other country. However, perhaps due to the lack of enough policy instruments, they cannot equate the marginal costs of abatement across the countries, leaving room for Pareto improvement. This further improvement can be achieved if the two countries also contribute to a conventional public good. Chapter IV is an empirical exercise on some positive externality-generating activities by the elderly. It attempts to document the charitable giving of money and time by people aged 60 or above in the 2003 PSID data for the United States and analyze the influences of some economic and demographic factors on these activities. Income, wealth, the subjective rating of health status, and years in school are found to have statistically significant impacts. Income and wealth appear to have distinct influences. The tax price of money donation also has a statistically significant effect on money donations.

Empirical research on this problem has often been discouraging, and economic models suggest that solutions are unlikely or unstable. In contrast, the authors present a model and 4 studies that show that an unwaveringly consistent contributor can effectively catalyze cooperation in social dilemmas. The studies indicate that consistent contributors occur naturally, and their presence in a group causes others to contribute more and cooperate more often, with no apparent cost to the consistent contributor and often gain. These positive effects seem to result from a consistent contributor's impact on group members' cooperative inferences about group norms.

The beauty premium, however, disappears when we provide information on individual contributions, and becomes a beauty penalty. Players seem to expect beautiful people to be more cooperative. Relative to these expectations, they appear more selfish, which in turn results in less cooperation by others. These appear to be clear examples of stereotyping.

the costs often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels
of cooperation. However, the effectiveness of punishment depends not
only on how costly it is, but also on the circumstances defining the
social dilemma. Using the snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted
a series of economic experiments to determine whether severe punishment
is more effective than mild punishment. We have observed that severe
punishment is not necessarily more effective, even if the cost of
punishment is identical in both cases. The benefits of severe punishment
become evident only under extremely adverse conditions, when to
cooperate is highly improbable in the absence of sanctions. If
cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads
to higher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative.
Presented results suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem
not only from imposed fines, but may also have a psychological
background. Small fines can do wonders in motivating us to chose
cooperation over defection, but without the paralyzing effect that may
be brought about by large fines. The later should be utilized only when

based on group reputation}",{8-18},{Cooperation; Indirect reciprocity; Outgroup homogeneity; Community},{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},{0022-5193},"Masuda, Naoki","{Indirect reciprocity in which players cooperate with unacquainted other
players having good reputations is a mechanism for cooperation in
relatively large populations subjected to social dilemma situations.
When the population has group structure, as is often found in social
networks, players in experiments are considered to show behavior that
deviates from existing theoretical models of indirect reciprocity.
First, players often show ingroup favoritism (i.e., cooperation only
within the group) rather than full cooperation (i.e., cooperation within
and across groups), even though the latter is Parcto efficient. Second,
in general, humans approximate ontgroup members' personal
characteristics, presumably including the reputation used for indirect
reciprocity, by a single value attached to the group. Humans use such a
stereotypic approximation, a phenomenon known as outgroup homogeneity in
social psychology. I propose a model of indirect reciprocity in
populations with group structure to examine the possibility of ingroup
favoritism and full cooperation. In accordance with outgroup
homogeneity, I assume that players approximate outgroup members'
personal reputations by a single reputation value attached to the group.
I show that ingroup favoritism and full cooperation are stable under
different social norms (i.e., rules for assigning reputations) such that
they do not coexist in a single model. If players are forced to
consistently use the same social norm for assessing different types of
interactions (i.e., ingroup versus outgroup interactions), only full
cooperation survives. The discovered mechanism is distinct from any form
of group selection. The results also suggest potential methods for
reducing ingroup bias to shift the equilibrium from ingroup favoritism
to full cooperation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We test these hypotheses experimentally and examine whether the effect of group size is purely due to the number of group members or if information about other group members is what is important.

It was assumed that the primary focus of people in step-level public good dilemmas is to make sure that the group surpasses the threshold. Consequently, when the level of threshold is difficult to reach people are expected to provide more support for and cooperate with a leader that monitors and controls the contributions made toward the public good. However, if the threshold is easy to surpass people will focus more on whether the obtained public good or bonus will be distributed according to agreements, suggesting that people will provide more support to and cooperate with a leader that monitors and controls the distribution of the bonus. These predictions were confirmed across two experiments using a step-level public good paradigm with a dichotomous (Study 1) and a continuous (Study 2) contribution choice. Moreover, the results also revealed that perceptions of trust accounted, in part, for the effect of level of threshold on people's leadership preferences.

Research on Construal Level Theory (CLT) suggests that decision information of distant future events are construed more abstractly than the same information regarding near future events. If distant future decisions facilitate abstract construal of information, then this information may be more readily compared to abstract reference values, such as social values. Also, if a near future perspective facilitates low-level construal of behavioral alternatives, then self-efficacy, which is a feasibility concern, should be more strongly related to cooperative intentions in such perspective, relative to a distant future perspective.

In the experimental work presented here, a shared-database setting is selected as a prototypical situation of net-based information exchange and examined from a social-dilemma perspective: the individual who contributes information to a shared database must reckon with costs and no benefits. The most efficient strategy from the perspective of the individual is thus to withhold information. Previous research has shown that a group-awareness tool which provides information about the contribution behavior of group members influences people's information-exchange behavior. In order to examine the psychological processes underlying these effects of group awareness in more detail, the present study adopts an interactional approach, according to which person-situation interaction is investigated. Certain personality traits (interpersonal trust, sensation seeking, and self-monitoring) were measured and several hypotheses tested regarding the reactions of individuals with high and low trait values to different types of awareness information. Results demonstrate that awareness tools providing information about highly cooperative group members encourage participants to trust one another and minimize the risk of being exploited. When an awareness tool additionally provides feedback about the contribution behavior of single individuals, it becomes an opportunity for self-presentation. In conclusion, an interactional approach which considers personality traits and situational factors in a net-based information-exchange situation provides new insights into both the influence processes of group awareness and the connection of these processes to specific personality traits with respect to contribution behavior.

Here we combine advances in experimental economics and evolutionary biology that separately have shown that costly punishment and reputation formation, respectively, induce cooperation in social dilemmas. The mechanisms of punishment and reputation, however, substantially differ in their means for 'disciplining' non-cooperators. Direct punishment incurs salient costs for both the punisher and the punished, whereas reputation mechanisms discipline by withholding action, immediately saving costs for the 'punisher'. Consequently, costly punishment may become extinct in environments in which effective reputation building--for example, through indirect reciprocity--provides a cheaper and powerful way to sustain cooperation. Unexpectedly, as we show here, punishment is maintained when a combination with reputation building is available, however, at a low level. Costly punishment acts are markedly reduced although not simply substituted by appreciating reputation. Indeed, the remaining punishment acts are concentrated on free-riders, who are most severely punished in the combination. When given a choice, subjects even prefer a combination of reputation building with costly punishment. The interaction between punishment and reputation building boosts cooperative efficiency. Because punishment and reputation building are omnipresent interacting forces in human societies, costly punishing should appear less destructive without losing its deterring force.

The refined approach builds on key tenets of social identity theory to argue that identity affects cooperation by leading actors to maximize ingroup outcomes and minimize ingroup inequalities. A key implication of the argument is that social identity is predicted to reduce actors' responses to the 'greed component' in social dilemmas (the incentive to 'free-ride' on others' cooperation), but that it will not affect actors' responses to the 'fear component' (the motivation to avoid being 'suckered'). These predictions stand in contrast to those of two existing explanations of social identity and cooperation. The three arguments are tested against the results of two new experiments. Overall, the results support the refined approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",article,2007-00431-00320061101,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model was applied to a 2-person variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma game where 60 college students were each paired with a confederate (also college students) who responded over trials entirely generously, contingently generously, or nongenerously. 30 Ss were informed that there would be 10 trials while the other 30 were uninformed. Basically, Ss tended to match the generosity level of the confederate and were less generous when trial number was known. Evidence for Sahlins' model was provided by Ss' reports of reasons for their choices in the game. Those in the generous condition gave reasons for reciprocating based on a general feeling of obligation, trust, and desire to cooperate. Ss in the contingently generous condition gave reasons for reciprocating based on economic exchange and a desire to maintain a balance of resources. Ss in the nongenerous condition gave reasons based on a desire to take what profits one could before the other got them.

It was predicted that initial recognition of uncontrollable social outcomes would arouse negative interpersonal affect and generate attempts to restore control. Residents of long- and short-corridor-design dormitories, required to live in large and moderate size groups, were surveyed and considered in an experimental session following 1, 3, or 7 wks of residence. Frequent contact with unfamiliar neighbors and visitors in the relatively uncontrolled hallway of the long corridor was seen as generating crowding and difficulty in regulating interpersonal contact. As expectations for control diminished, helpless responding was expected to increase. To test these hypotheses, 60 dormitory residents completed surveys, and 60 participated in an experiment in which they played a Prisoner's Dilemma game that was modified so as to assess helplessness. Data confirm the predictions, indicating that the effects of loss of regulatory control in high-density residential settings were sequential and were mediated by expectations for control. Residents of the long-corridor dormitory, compared with short-corridor residents, were more competitive, reactive, and involved with reestablishing control after 1 and 3 wks of residence. By the end of 7 wks, however, they had become more withdrawn, were less involved, and exhibited symptoms of helplessness.

option, even though a larger more delayed option produces a higher
intake rate. This impulsive behavior has implications for several
behavioral problems including social cooperation. This paper presents
two experiments using captive blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) that
consider the effects of payoff accumulation and temporal clumping on
impulsiveness and cooperation. Payoff accumulation refers to a situation
where the benefits gained from each choice trial accumulate fro, one
trial to the next, and only become available to the animal after it has
completed a fixed number of trials. We hypothesized that this would
reduce impulsiveness because it removes the advantage of quickly
realizing food gains. Clumping refers to situation in which the animal
experiences several choice trials ill quick succession followed by a
long pause before the next clump. We hypothesized that if payoffs
accumulated over a clump of trials this Would enhance the effect Of
accumulation. We tested the effects of accumulation and clumping on
impulsiveness ill a self-control situation. We found a significant
interaction between clumping and accumulation. Payoff accumulation
reduced impulsiveness, but only when trials were clumped. Post hoc
analyses suggest that clumping alone increases impulsiveness. A second
experiment applied these results to cooperation. This experiment reveal
an interaction between payoff accumulation and trial's position within
the clump. Jays were more likely to cooperate on the first trial of a
clump, but the likelihood of cooperation dropped after the first trial.
However, this drop was larger when payoffs did not accumulate. This
observation suggests that the difference between accumulated and
unaccumulated treatments that we reported previously (Science 198: 22
16-22 18) may be largely due to differences in how animals behave in the

theoretical and field sources of when and how groups can solve the
problem of collective action through self-governing mechanisms.
Widespread agreement exists that cooperation can happen, but little
agreement as to how. As a first step, we propose that individuals may
use three layers of information in deciding about their level of
cooperation. The layers range from the material incentives of a specific
production function and the dynamics of the game, to the composition of
the group and the individual characteristics of the player. We use this
framework to analyze data from a set of experiments conducted with
actual ecosystem users in three rural villages of Colombia. Prior
experience of the participants, their perception of external regulation,
and the composition of the group, influence decisions to cooperate or
defect in the experiment. Understanding the multiple information levels
of a game as they affect incentives helps to explain decisions in
collective-action dilemmas. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

individual decisions to cooperate. These decisions occurred in the
context of a nested social dilemma in which individuals, subgroups, and
the larger collective each held distinct and incompatible interests. In
Study 1, when the two subgroups in the dilemma were from different real
organizations, higher organizational identification caused lower
cooperation with the collective (and higher cooperation with the
subgroup) when the opposing organization had a purportedly
individualistic culture and reputation. The results of Study 2 supported
this interpretation by showing that organizational identification had a
negative effect on collective cooperation, and a corresponding positive
effect on subgroup cooperation, when decision makers perceived the
opposing department to have an individualistic reputation. I discuss the
implications of these results for organizations that try to elicit
cooperation by fostering members' organizational identification. (C)

associated with punishing defectors often exceed the benefits for the
group. It has been argued that centralized punishment institutions can
overcome the detrimental effects of peer-punishment. However, this
argument presupposes the existence of a legitimate authority and leaves
an unresolved gap in the transition from peer-punishment to centralized
punishment. Here we show that the origins of centralized punishment
could lie in individuals' distinct ability to punish defectors. In our
laboratory experiment, we vary the structure of the punishment situation
to disentangle the effects of punitive preferences, monetary incentives,
and individual punishment costs on the punishment of defectors. We find
that actors tacitly coordinate on the strongest group member to punish
defectors, even if the strongest individual incurs a net loss from
punishment. Such coordination leads to a more effective and more
efficient provision of a cooperative environment than we observe in
groups of all equals. Our results show that even an arbitrary assignment
of an individual to a focal position in the social hierarchy can trigger
the endogenous emergence of more centralized forms of punishment.}",article,ISI:000355298600001,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000355298600001},{CJ2FC},{Sci Rep},{16},{0},{23},{54},,,"{Przepiorka, Wojtek/0000-0001-9432-8696

primary experimental result is that institutions which both reward and

institutions which only punish (IP) or which only reward (IR), and that
IP has contribution levels significantly above IR. Although comparing
their single-round NE strategies correctly predicts which incentives are
best at promoting cooperation, individuals do not play these strategies

combine conforming behavior with reactions to being rewarded/ punished
provide a better explanation of observed outcomes. In our experiments,
some individuals who display more cooperation than other individuals can
be regarded as the exemplars (or leaders). The role of these exemplars

cooperate with reflection causing them to behave selfishly. Empirical
support for this claim came from experiments using a 4-player public
goods game with a marginal return of 0.5 showing that people contributed
more money to a common project when they had to decide quickly (i.e., a
decision based on intuition) than when they were instructed to reflect
and decide slowly. This intuitive-cooperation effect is of high
scientific and practical importance because it argues against a central
assumption of traditional economic and evolutionary models. The first
experiment of present study was set up to examine the generality of the
intuitive-cooperation effect and to further validate the experimental
task producing the effect. In Experiment 1, we investigated Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers' contributions to a 4-player public goods
game with a marginal return of 0.5 while we manipulated the knowledge
about the other players' contribution to the public goods game
(contribution known vs. contribution unknown), the identity of the other
players (humans vs. computers randomly generating contributions) and the
time constraint (time pressure/intuition vs. forced delay/reflection).
However, the results of Experiment 1 failed to reveal an
intuitive-cooperation effect. Furthermore, four subsequent direct
replications attempts with AMT workers (Experiments 2a, 2b, 2c and
Experiment 3, which was conducted with naive/inexperienced participants)
also failed to demonstrate intuitive-cooperation effects. Taken
together, the results of the present study could not corroborate the
idea that people are intuitively cooperative, hence suggesting that the
theoretical relationship between intuition and cooperation should be
further scrutinized.}",article,ISI:000338029800104,{5},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000338029800104},{AJ9KS},{PLoS One},{20},{1},{59},{12},,,,,{verkoeijen@fsw.eur.nl},{Multidisciplinary Sciences},{Science \& Technology - Other Topics},{REPLICABILITY; REPLICATIONS; PSYCHOLOGY; CRISIS},{e96654},{10.1371/journal.pone.0096654},"{Verkoeijen, PPJL (Corresponding Author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Psychol, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Does cooperation require deliberate self-restraint? Or is spontaneous

theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation
is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of
generalized cooperative intuitions. Deliberation, by contrast, adjusts
behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation. Thus, in one-shot
anonymous interactions where selfishness is optimal, intuitive responses
tend to be more cooperative than deliberative responses. We test this
`social heuristics hypothesis' by aggregating across every cooperation
experiment using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period
(15 studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time
pressure experiment. Doing so demonstrates a positive average effect of
time pressure on cooperation. We also find substantial variation in this

``hard problem of cooperation{''} as that of achieving high levels of
cooperation in a group of non-cooperative types. Can the hard problem be
solved by institutions with monitoring and sanctions? In a laboratory
experiment we find that the answer is affirmative if the institution is
imposed on the group but negative if development of the institution is
left to the group to vote on. In the experiment, participants were
divided into groups of either cooperative types or non-cooperative types
depending on their behavior in a public goods game. In these homogeneous
groups they repeatedly played a public goods game regulated by an
institution that incorporated several of the key properties identified
by Ostrom: operational rules, monitoring, rewards, punishments, and (in
one condition) change of rules. When change of rules was not possible
and punishments were set to be high, groups of both types generally
abided by operational rules demanding high contributions to the common
good, and thereby achieved high levels of payoffs. Under less severe
rules, both types of groups did worse but non-cooperative types did
worst. Thus, non-cooperative groups profited the most from being
governed by an institution demanding high contributions and employing
high punishments. Nevertheless, in a condition where change of rules
through voting was made possible, development of the institution in this
direction was more often voted down in groups of non-cooperative types.
We discuss the relevance of the hard problem and fit our results into a
bigger picture of institutional and individual determinants of
cooperative behavior.}",article,ISI:000306354700036,{7},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000306354700036},{973IV},{PLoS One},{26},{0},{7},{60},"{This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (grants 2009

Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social
networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic,
changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This
dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that
has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical
attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those
around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present
experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and
dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize
cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale
cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial
to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research,
we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are
shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also
find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently,
cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network
connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome:
Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring.
Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links
with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to
substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the
predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and
demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in
supporting large- scale human cooperation.}",article,ISI:000297463100026,{48},,{NATL ACAD SCIENCES},,,{2020-11-06},"{Green Published, Bronze}",{ISI:000297463100026},{853ZB},{Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.},{115},{4},{305},{66},"{We are grateful for extensive input and suggestions from Feng Fu and

argue that the large difference between the two regions is due to a

cooperative resource management and intact traditional norms. Moreover,
the real-life payoffs to cooperation are higher in Namibia stemming from

cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and
collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce
individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision.
Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed
with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline
defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However,
extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in
complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for
instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the
police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and
legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the
public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single
monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the
monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we
conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers
from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the
effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal
effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to
the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our
essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by
introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies,
cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection
and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain
actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.}",article,ISI:000292376700026,{27},,{NATL ACAD SCIENCES},,,{2020-11-06},"{Green Published, Bronze}",{ISI:000292376700026},{787LC},{Proc.

cooperation among non-kin, has been modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma.
According to this game, cooperation could evolve when individuals, who
expect to play again, use conditional strategies like tit-for-tat or
Pavlov. There is evidence that humans use such strategies to achieve
mutual cooperation, but most controlled experiments with non-human
animals have failed to find cooperation. One reason for this could be
that subjects fail to cooperate because they behave as if they were to
play only once. To assess this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment
with monogamous zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that were tested in
a two-choice apparatus, with either their social partner or an
experimental opponent of the opposite sex. We found that zebra finches
maintained high levels of cooperation in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
game only when interacting with their social partner. Although other
mechanisms may have contributed to the observed difference between the
two treatments, our results support the hypothesis that animals do not
systematically give in to the short-term temptation of cheating when
long-term benefits exist. Thus, our findings contradict the commonly

require large-scale human cooperation, for example, the overharvesting
of natural resources and human-induced global warming. However, what
does globalization imply for the cooperation needed to address such
global social dilemmas? Two competing hypotheses are offered. One
hypothesis is that globalization prompts reactionary movements that
reinforce parochial distinctions among people. Large-scale cooperation
then focuses on favoring one's own ethnic, racial, or language group.
The alternative hypothesis suggests that globalization strengthens
cosmopolitan attitudes by weakening the relevance of ethnicity,
locality, or nationhood as sources of identification. In essence,
globalization, the increasing interconnectedness of people worldwide,
broadens the group boundaries within which individuals perceive they
belong. We test these hypotheses by measuring globalization at both the
country and individual levels and analyzing the relationship between
globalization and individual cooperation with distal others in
multilevel sequential cooperation experiments in which players can
contribute to individual, local, and/or global accounts. Our samples
were drawn from the general populations of the United States, Italy,
Russia, Argentina, South Africa, and Iran. We find that as country and
individual levels of globalization increase, so too does individual
cooperation at the global level vis-a-vis the local level. In essence,
``globalized'' individuals draw broader group boundaries than others,
eschewing parochial motivations in favor of cosmopolitan ones.
Globalization may thus be fundamental in shaping contemporary
large-scale cooperation and may be a positive force toward the provision
of global public goods.}",article,ISI:000264278800018,{11},,{NATL ACAD SCIENCES},,,{2020-11-06},"{Bronze, Green Published}",{ISI:000264278800018},{420HD},{Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.},{31},{2},{94},{49},"{We thank Donna Bahry, Patricio Dalton, Iain Edwards, Saul Keifman,

synchronous activity may serve as a partial solution to the free-rider

individuals is one of the fundamental problems in biology and the social
sciences. Recent findings suggest that altruistic punishment is an
important mechanism maintaining cooperation among humans. We
experimentally explore the boundaries of altruistic punishment to
maintain cooperation by varying both the cost and the impact of
punishment, using an exceptionally extensive subject pool. Our results
show that cooperation is only maintained if conditions for altruistic
punishment are relatively favourable: low cost for the punisher and high
impact on the punished. Our results indicate that punishment is strongly
governed by its cost-to-impact ratio and that its effect on cooperation
can be pinned down to one single variable: the threshold level of
free-riding that goes unpunished. Additionally, actual pay-offs are the
lowest when altruistic punishment maintains cooperation, because the
pay-off destroyed through punishment exceeds the gains from increased
cooperation. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that
punishment decisions come from an amalgam of emotional response and
cognitive cost-impact analysis and suggest that altruistic punishment
alone can hardly maintain cooperation under multi-level natural
selection. Uncovering the workings of altruistic punishment as has been
done here is important because it helps predicting under which
conditions altruistic punishment is expected to maintain cooperation.}",article,ISI:000253865900001,{1637},,{ROYAL SOC},,,{2020-11-06},{Green Published},{ISI:000253865900001},{272NK},{Proc. R. Soc. B-Biol. Sci.},{67},{2},{209},{45},,,,"{sarinopoulos, isidoros/B-5453-2010

prisoner's dilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were
noisy, even though players could monitor one another's past actions
perfectly. In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of
opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at
which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the
robust observation from the psychology literature that partial
reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its
consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning.
This effect is magnified in the repeated game: when others are slow to
learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which
further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in
the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning,
can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there
may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful
attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned

However, the present study shows that not only the structure but also the content or context of the situation is important. This study consisted of two parts. In one part, participants responded to 21 everyday social dilemmas by indicating how frequently they would behave cooperatively or noncooperatively. These data were factor analyzed and five factors were distinguished. For three factors the situations with high loadings had structural aspects in common and for two other factors the situations with high loadings dealt with the same content or issue. In the other part of the study, the participants made choices in an experimental social dilemma. They could contribute money to a pool and they received money (regardless of their own contribution) if the number of contributors was sufficient. The number of times the subjects made (monetary) contributions in this step-level public good dilemma correlated significantly only with the scores on the factor with situations in which money was at stake. It is argued that a classification of (daily life) social dilemmas is useful for further research.

When a sanctioning system was already present, however, sanction support was strong and not affected by feedback. Interestingly, the presence of a sanctioning system increased pessimism about attaining collective efficiency. This suggests that the mere presence of a sanctioning system creates the need to have that sanctioning system, and that installing one can have irreversible consequences.

In these situations individuals typically are tempted to take actions that favor (sometimes even maximize) their short-term egocentric interests. However, if all group members adopt such behaviors, the group suffers since all its members are worse off than they could be by endorsing alternative prosocial actions that favor (sometimes even maximize) the collective interest. This book provides an overview and summary of the state of social psychological research on social dilemmas. It is organized around four core issues: individual differences, which determine people's preferences for outcomes that promote either their own or their group's well-being; the study of dynamic processes based on simulations of artificial societies; social dilemmas that emerge in intergroup conflicts; and the effect of various types and sources of uncertainty on behavior in social dilemma situations.

To elaborate the idea that this effect arises from the development of within-group consensus, groups of six made explicit group decisions about their subsequent individual choice. Perceived demonstrability of cooperativeness in the dilemma was manipulated through changes both to instructions and the incentives of the dilemma. As demonstrability decreased, so did the proportion of groups deciding to cooperate, leading to a reduction in the group discussion effect.

Dawes (1980) specifies two necessary conditions for the occurrence of such conflicts: (a) The payoff to each individual for acting in self-interest (called defecting) is higher than the payoff for acting in the interest of the collective (called cooperating) regardless of what the others do, but (b) all individuals receive a lower payoff if all defect rather than cooperate. Two examples of social dilemmas are the public good dilemma and the resource dilemma. How do people act and what are the key elements and factors that affect human behavior in these dilemmas? In this chapter we focus on the uncertainties individual decision makers face in social dilemmas and on the way they react to such uncertainties. Our aim is twofold. First we will present a brief review on what is known about uncertainty effects in social dilemmas. The second aim is to identify what is not known about uncertainty effects in the social dilemma.

Theorists have identified competing mechanisms for facilitating group cooperation, including group identity, sanctions and reciprocity. Here I use empirical data to explore how these mechanisms influence cooperation in the natural laboratory of microcredit borrowing groups. Microcredit makes loans to high-risk borrowers through borrowing groups in which individuals' access to credit is dependent on the behavior of other members of the group, thereby creating a social dilemma for members and an opportunity to observe cooperation in real world groups. By analyzing both collective goods production (loans) and compliance (repayment), I find that the competing mechanisms have differential effects. Group identity, sanctions and reciprocity are all associated with more borrowing in the group. Only reciprocity, however, limits loan delinquency and is associated with group longevity, suggesting both that collective goods production is a distinct process from group compliance over time, and that reciprocity may be an important mechanism in both processes. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of group cooperation, as well as the implications for the related theoretical concept of embeddedness.

To retest Simpson's hypotheses, I propose a new asymmetric game, the Fear-of-Greed Dilemma. The asymmetry is important for two reasons. First, it creates the risk of exploitation that Simpsons Fear Dilemma lacked. Second, it exposes a critical limitation in Rapoport's (1964) K-index and suggests a re-specification.

In this chapter we first briefly review previous research with the aim of understanding the reasons for these results. An important issue is how the demonstrated negative effects can be counteracted. We therefore ask whether effective debiasing procedures are available. In particular we emphasize one problem, perhaps unique to these kinds of resource-management problems where there is interdependence between the actors. If somebody knows that he or she knows more than the others, that is, if there is asymmetrical access to information about the resource, why should this person share his or her knowledge rather than using it to exploit others? Given that everyone knows that this may be the case, why should one ever trust information somebody else provides? Since there seldom may be any alternative ways of obtaining knowledge, debiasing is perhaps futile. We will report new experiments that we have carried out, whose messages are more optimistic. We will also analyze important principal-agent problems in the society where asymmetric access to information is a ubiquitous property.

People are reluctant to contribute information because they save time, effort and perhaps social power if they withhold their knowledge and socially loaf. But if all people choose this individually efficient strategy, then no information exchange can take place, and the group is less effective than it would have been if all members contributed. Thus, in the knowledge-exchange situation, group norms and individual norms oppose each other. In order to strengthen people's orientation towards the group, virtual collaborative tools sometimes provide member portraits. But based on the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effect (SIDE)-Model, ambivalent effects of these member portraits are expected according to people's social categorization: when people identify more strongly with the group, such portraits enhance participation, whereas when people have a stronger individual identity, they undermine participation. This study links the concepts of social value orientation to identity salience. The assumption is that in the information-exchange dilemma, the social value orientation of a group member will determine whether group identity or individual identity becomes salient for that group member. We then extend the SIDE-model to the domain of social loafing and expect that portraits of the group members will have different effects for people with individual orientation and for people with prosocial orientation. An experiment confirmed this expectation and revealed a significant interaction between social value orientation and portraits. Especially striking is the result that for prosocials the provision of member portraits leads to an increase in social loafing. This is analogous to the predictions of the SIDE-model.

Computer simulations further suggested that group decisions made in the categorical elicitation mode would be more extreme than those in the continuous elicitation mode. A practical implication is that by strategic maneuver (or happenstance) a particular elicitation mode could be adopted, and the group decision could be steered one way or the other. The social dilemma context of the experiment provided the additional opportunity to study the effects of provision point uncertainty on public good provision. Computer simulations based on individuals' contribution decisions found that a fixed provision point would provide a public good more often than would a variable provision point. Although a provision point is often an uncertain forecast and is seldom an exact value, the simulation results suggested that a provision point should be specified as an exact value despite its inherent variability in order to ensure a high public good provision rate.

However, in games with more than two players, relaxing this assumption results in a more general equilibrium concept based on joint beliefs (P. Vanderschraaf, 1995). This article explores the implications of this joint-beliefs equilibrium concept for two kinds of conflictual coordination games: crisis bargaining and public goods provision. We find that, using updating consistent with Bayes' rule, players' beliefs converge to equilibria in joint beliefs which do not satisfy probabilistic independence. In addition, joint beliefs greatly expand the set of mixed equilibria. On the face of it, allowing for joint beliefs might be expected to increase the prospects for coordination. However, we show that if players use joint beliefs, which may be more likely as the number of players increases, then the prospects for coordination in these games declines vis-à-vis independent beliefs.

The emotions of each S were coded from videotape independently of his/her partner's and with the sound turned off. Moral acts were categorically identified as equalization, reparation, stalemate, default, and betrayal.

Results indicate that there was a tendency for the group-representative (GRC) and GAC to be more competitive than the individuals condition and IC, that the GRC was more competitive than the GAC, and that the IC and individuals condition did not differ. The difference between the GRC and GAC is interpreted as consistent with a prediction that intergroup contact can reduce competitiveness even when there is conflict and the absence of norms requiring cooperative behavior.

goods game. The corruption game is divided into three groups: high- and
low-monitoring scenarios as well as a control group not exposed to the
game. The public goods game is divided into three groups: the standard
game, a game with centralized punishment executed by an exogenously
assigned leader, and a game similar to the second one, but adding the
possibility of counter-punishment. There are four key results. First,
there is more corruption in the low-monitoring group. Second, in the
public goods game there is less cooperation in the low-monitoring group
than in the group with more intensive monitoring. Third, the option of
punishment increases cooperation, but the sensitivity to punishment is
greater in the high-monitoring (low-corruption) group. Fourth, the
option of counter-punishment of the leader decreases cooperation. Our
results highlight the importance of corruption in decreasing trust and

fishing community located in the Caribbean coast of Colombia, which
depends mainly on the fishery resources of the Cienaga Grande de Santa

contributions to the public good and their levels of impatience are not
robustly correlated to their real fishing behavior. We argue that the

Second, we analyze how a situation of social dilemma can be overcome by means of structural and motivational solutions. Third, we provide empirical evidence from our survey in hospitals. These findings support three of our five hypotheses: direct channels for interaction, organizational culture, and intrinsic motivation are relevant requirements for knowledge transfer. Team size is not a significant factor for transferring knowledge in hospitals. Furthermore, our empirical findings differentiate between providing and obtaining knowledge. The last finding leads back to a modification of the theoretical framework.

This 'collective-risk social dilemma' exists in various social scenarios, the globally most challenging one being the prevention of dangerous climate change. Reaching the collective target requires individual sacrifice, with benefits to all but no guarantee that others will also contribute. It even seems tempting to contribute less and save money to induce others to contribute more, hence the dilemma and the risk of failure. Here, we introduce the collective-risk social dilemma and simulate it in a controlled experiment: Will a group of people reach a fixed target sum through successive monetary contributions, when they know they will lose all their remaining money with a certain probability if they fail to reach the target sum? We find that, under high risk of simulated dangerous climate change, half of the groups succeed in reaching the target sum, whereas the others only marginally fail. When the risk of loss is only as high as the necessary average investment or even lower, the groups generally fail to reach the target sum. We conclude that one possible strategy to relieve the collective-risk dilemma in high-risk situations is to convince people that failure to invest enough is very likely to cause grave financial loss to the individual. Our analysis describes the social window humankind has to prevent dangerous climate change.

Even after an equality violation, group members continued to base their decisions on the equality rule if they faced a social dilemma with the same group members. But when group members faced a social dilemma with only the violator of equality, contributions were lowered. Experiment 2 showed that this is especially true for low trusters.

Social dilemma research also shows that leaders feel entitled to earn more, and because of this, are more inclined to contribute less than an equal share to a public good, which may damage the collective. In two experiments, the social dilemma context is used to examine how group members react when either a leader or a follower violates the equality norm. Moreover, we demonstrate how asking for forgiveness sometimes mitigates people's reactions to equality norm violations. Results show that asking for forgiveness attenuates negative emotions, retribution, and non-cooperation—but more so if followers, relative to leaders, violated equality. In fact, leaders are less likely to be seen as even violating norms, suggesting that group members perceive leaders to be entitled.

They may also evoke moral concerns regarding cooperation as they signal that cooperation is socially approved of and non-cooperation socially disapproved of. I argue that punishments do this to a greater extent than rewards as punishments communicate an obligatory rule and rewards communicate a voluntary rule. Indeed, the first experiment shows that, in a social dilemma, the concept of punishment increased cooperation and the concept of a reward did not. The second experiment showed that participants showed more disapproval towards an offender when there was a punishment for non-compliance than when there was a reward for compliance. These findings suggest that punishing non-cooperation more strongly foster moral concerns regarding cooperation than rewarding cooperation. Possible implications for internalizations are discussed.

Using a new social dilemma task (the parcel delivery paradigm), it was hypothesized that incidents of negative noise would exert detrimental effects on trust and trust-related judgments and experiences, as well as cooperation, and that relative to tit for tat and self-regarding strategies (stingy or unconditionally cooperative strategies), other-regarding strategies (i.e., unconditional cooperation and generosity) would be more effective at reducing such as detrimental effects. Results from 2 studies provided strong support for these hypotheses, suggesting that the power of generosity is underestimated in the extant literature, especially in its ability to maintain or build trust, which is essential for coping with noise.

To account for these results, we carried out a vignette-type study in Experiment 2, in which participants rated how likely they were to engage in a variety of punishing behaviors that typically happen in the real world. A factor analysis indicated that people usually assign two different types of meanings to punishing behaviors. One is 'Vengeance,' which unfair people, regardless of their levels of trust, tend to inflict; the other is 'Warning,' which tends to be favored by fair people. The results of Experiment 3, another vignette study, showed that observers also consider Vengeance as unfair and Warning fair.

Two studies are presented which show that group members low in dispositional trust (low trusters) are likely to choose for a public commitment system when their situational expectations concerning other group members’ contributions are high, while those high in dispositional trust (high trusters) are likely to choose for a public commitment system when their situational expectations concerning other group members’ contributions are low.

Relative to managers from the US and Germany, Israeli managers were more likely to follow an individually rational decision-making approach, taking more resources in a high versus low economic power condition. In contrast, managers from Hong Kong in a high economic power condition followed a collectively rational approach, voluntarily taking fewer resources. Egocentrism mediated this interaction effect of group culture and economic power for the Israeli managers who were more egocentric and believed it was fair to harvest more resources in a high power condition. However, egocentrism did not mediate the interaction effect for managers from Hong Kong.

The purpose of the present research is to examine whether experiences with negative noise in a commons dilemma may undermine conservational motivation and behavior, even in a subsequent commons dilemma that is free of noise. Participants first interacted in a commons dilemma task--with noise versus without noise--in which the common pool was sustained versus deteriorating. Afterwards, participants were involved in an identical second task in the same pool size condition but noise-free for everybody. Consistent with hypotheses, participants who faced noise and a deteriorating resource in the first task exhibited lower levels of conservation in the second task than did participants who were always acting free of noise. This pattern was mediated by a reduced motivation to preserve the common pool, suggesting that the experience of noise in combination with a decline in collective resources may especially undermine cooperative motivation and behavior.

One approach to understanding when and why players cooperate in these games is to consider the adaptive problems faced by human ancestors and the systems designed to solve these problems. This analysis suggests that these systems should be sensitive to particular features of the environment that activate decision rules that cause one to incur costs to benefit one's group. It is hypothesized that due to the extremely computationally complex problems associated with coordinating the actions of multiple individuals, these systems might be sensitive to cues that indicate that one is able to coordinate with other members of a group. Further, because the demands of 'real-time' coordination are particularly strong for hunting and warfare, activities thought to have been predominantly in the domain of males, males might be more likely to be affected by the presence of these cues. Two experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. In these studies, subjects in a public goods game were induced to engage in behaviors that were hypothesized to activate systems designed to detect the ability to coordinate. In particular, subjects matched eyegazes with one another, touched one another gently, and tapped out rhythms in synchrony. Contributions in these conditions were compared to contributions in a baseline condition as well as a condition in which communication was allowed, but only through a virtual 'chat room' generated on computers. Results indicated that matching eyegazes and touching one another did increase rates of contributions to the public good for male but not female subjects. Counter to hypotheses, the rhythm manipulation had no effect, and communication over the computer network did increase contributions for male but not female subjects. It is suggested that considering the nature of the adaptations for solving both the free rider problem and the coordination problem represents a potentially valuable direction for future research.

Axelrod's (1984) prescription to not worry about the outcomes that others receive in a social dilemma, a mixed-motive situation in which interdependent group members face a conflict between selfish and collective gain. Exp 1 determined whether cooperation is reduced when a person stands to receive poorer outcomes than an opponent and if people who experience lesser outcomes are unresponsive to a reciprocal strategy. Results showed that people do attend and react to others' outcomes, with Ss whose outcomes were of a lesser magnitude than the opponent being uncooperative and Ss with greater-magnitude outcomes being very cooperative. This was true even though own and other outcomes were linearly equivalent. The 2nd study showed that dispositional envy can predict cooperation rate and that referent cognitions theory can be applied to help alleviate the impact of differing outcomes, by making amends for small-magnitude outcomes at the end of the game (amelioration) and by providing a reasonable explanation for why the differences in outcomes exist (justification), although the former intervention was ineffective with people with high levels of dispositional envy. Discussion focuses on the role of mental simulations in the reduction of envy effects.

Whether economic incentives are perceived as just or legitimate does not matter in these theories. Fairness-based altruism is, however, a powerful source of human cooperation. In a series of social dilemma experiments with 283 university students, this study shows that the prevailing self-interest approach has serious shortcomings because it overlooks negative effects of sanctions on human altruism. Sanctions revealing selfish or greedy intentions destroy altruistic cooperation almost completely, whereas sanctions perceived as fair leave altruism intact. These findings challenge proximate and ultimate theories of human cooperation that neglect the distinction between fair and unfair sanctions, and they are probably relevant in all domains in which voluntary compliance matters--in relations between spouses, in the education of children, in business relations and organizations, as well as in markets.

Prospect theory states that individuals are risk-averse when outcomes are framed as gains, and risk-seeking when outcomes are framed as losses. On the basis of this framework, previous research on social dilemmas has addressed the question of whether people are more cooperative in the negative domain than in the positive domain, but this research has led to inconsistent results. A possible explanation for this is that in many social dilemmas it is unclear whether cooperation or defection is the risky choice. In the current paper, we compare the well-studied prisoner’s dilemma with the less studied chicken game. Whereas in the prisoner’s dilemma it is unclear what constitutes the risky option, in the chicken game the risky option is quite clear. Consistent with predictions, we found in the chicken game more defection in the loss frame than in the gain frame, but no difference between the gain and loss frame in the prisoner’s dilemma. Moreover, choices were predicted by risk attitude in the chicken game, but not in the prisoner’s dilemma.

Past research investigating the altruistic functions of induced social emotions have been conducted solely in the context of either iterative and/or face-to-face interactions. As a result, the altruistic behaviors found in these studies cannot be solely attributed to these induced emotions. In light of these past works, the current study compared cooperation rates of individuals following either a guilt or neutral mood induction procedure in an anonymous, one-shot social dilemma (i.e. the prisoner’s dilemma). Participants were 120 female undergraduates (60 engaged in a guilt induction procedure and 60 engaged in a neutral mood induction procedure) enrolled at a large university asked to participate in a one-shot social dilemma with a partner that they would never meet. Primary analyses found no evidence regarding group differences in rates of cooperation. Secondary analyses of subjective emotions ratings (i.e. guilt, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear) suggest that generalized negative affect may be associated with decreased rates of cooperation while positive affect may be associated with increase rates of cooperation. Future research investigating the effects of generalized negative and positive affect as well as specifically induced emotions needs to be conducted to further evaluate this suggestion.

Simulated societies consist of three groups of agents with markers and tolerance: altruists, defectors, and parochial egoists. They simultaneously play a one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma game with neighbors by helping tolerably similar ones and by declining to help otherwise. They either imitate markers and tolerance of more successful neighbors or switch partners by breaking the old ones to out-group neighbors after creating new ties to others if both sides accept each other as in-group. Our study furthers understanding of the dynamics of cooperation in human societies facing the Prisoner’s Dilemma: altruists alone are less likely to defeat defectors regardless of network topology as cooperation becomes costly and the average number of interaction partners increases; under these conditions, parochialism is necessary for the institutionalization of cooperation; agents adapt themselves to increasingly homogenized environments by learning intolerance; emergent cooperative societies in the presence of imitation errors are vulnerable to free-riders with tolerably similar markers; either persistent cultural diversity or highly clustered networks with long paths stabilize cooperation; and even if markers are completely mutable, society-wide and robust cooperation is achievable with increased diversity as hierarchical networks of cultural groups self-organize where less tolerant agents in the periphery shield more tolerant ones in the core from emerging free-riders. The current study provides sociologists with theoretical and methodological resources for a game-theoretical approach to institutional analysis. Socio-psychological research maintains that group identity enhances cooperation either because human subjects in pre-assigned groups maximize group-level rewards or when they expect continuing benefits from in-group favoritism. We rather demonstrate the evolution of cooperation without expectations of in-group reciprocity. Cultural groups emerge as arbitrary markers become salient together with stratification driven by parochial interactions. Our study also contributes to understanding of how stable markets can evolve out of repeated plays of a social dilemma game among parochial agents locally embedded in on-going exchange networks with limited knowledge about costs and opportunities.

Mutualisms, in which organisms gain benefits during cooperation, are more common than reciprocity, in which organisms alternate roles as donors and receivers of benefits over time. Reciprocity involves more complex cognitive skills than mutualisms, requiring organisms interact repeatedly, remember past interactions, take future ones into consideration, and compare costs and benefits of cooperative behavior. Relations among costs and benefits define reciprocity, such that if costs decrease or benefits increase, a reciprocal dilemma can become a mutualism. It was traditionally assumed a prisoner's dilemma could be converted to a mutualism by changing ratios of costs and benefits, and that linear-transformations preserving ratios (e.g., increasing or decreasing costs and benefits by orders of magnitude) should not lead to changes in cooperation. This supposition assumes that costs and benefits are represented in the brain as they exist in reality—that subjective quantities increase linearly with objective quantities. However, evidence across evolution and development suggests that linear representations of quantities are accessible through experience and development to human adults, and that young children and animals represent quantities logarithmically—that is, differences among small quantities are over-estimated and differences among large quantities are compressed. Because logarithms do not preserve ratio information, linear transformations may lead objective reciprocal dilemmas to be experienced as mutualisms. This hypothesis successfully made five predictions about the effect of linear transformations on cooperative behavior. First, linear transformations of parameters led to more cooperative behavior in adults engaged in the prisoner's dilemma game, a task of reciprocal cooperation (Experiment 1). Second, logarithmically-scaled ratios of costs and benefits better predicted cooperative behavior than linearly-scaled ratios (Experiment 2). Third, linear transformations had a smaller effect on cooperation in populations with access to linear representations (adult humans, Experiment 3) than populations relying on logarithmic representations (human children; Experiment 4). Fourth, linear transformations in the prisoner's dilemma led to similar cooperative behavior as in a mutualism task (Experiments 5 and 6). Last, solitary organisms failing to meet the social cognitive requirements to engage in reciprocity (orangutans) show cooperative behavior in a linearly transformed dilemma. Together these findings show that cooperative behavior depends not on objective relations between costs and benefits, but on subjective, logarithmically-scaled relations.

If actors value the welfare of thirds, externalities will affect actors’ decisions. We test behavioral predictions from three leading ideas on social preferences (altruism, inequality aversion, competition) in two studies that employ four one-shot, 2-person prisoner’s dilemmas (PDs) that differ only in their externalities. The PDs respectively include a third party that (i) is indifferent, (ii) prefers defection, (iii) prefers cooperation. Our results show that while aggregate behavior is not affected by externalities, individual behavior is. Compared to a PD without externalities, prosocial individuals cooperate more when a third benefits from cooperation, but do not defect more when a third benefits from defection.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a direct effect of punishment, and empirical data that support conclusions pointing toward a symmetrical law of effect, such that behavior follows the matching law (Herrnstein, 1961) in equally opposing manner when compared to reinforcing outcomes. On the other hand, the domain of Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) has found that loss has a disproportionately larger effect on behavior than an equivalent gain, seeming to provide evidence contrary to the symmetry argument. The current experiments were designed to test this argument of symmetry using well-established interactions (1 – the Dictator Game, 2 – the Ultimatum Game, 3 – the Prisoner's Dilemma Game), where the stimuli at stake were tokens with one of two values: a conditioned reward stimulus (timeoff a boring task) or a conditioned aversive stimulus (time-in a boring task). Both allocation and cooperative behaviors were measured and correlated significantly with Prosocial, Individualist, and Competitor Social Value Orientation across approx. N=2100 participants. Amount given of reward tokens was equal to the amount kept of aversive tokens; overall both allocation and cooperation data indicate strong support for an argument for empirical symmetry between reinforcers and punishers in social interaction settings. These findings agree with previous research observing symmetry of behavior thus reinforcing the symmetrical law of effect (Thorndike, 1911). The results also indicate the reliability of the social value orientation measure in experiments involving social interaction and division of a utility.

Using self-categorization theory, the authors predicted that members of a collective would cooperate more when they faced homogeneous rather than heterogeneous resource frames. The starting point of resources for the members of each of 2 subgroups was manipulated, making up a larger collective in a nested social dilemma. The resources of the S's own subgroup started at the individual, subgroup, or collective level, and the resources of the opposing subgroup also started at the individual, subgroup, or collective level. The condition in which both subgroups' resources began at the collective level was similar to a traditional commons dilemma, while the condition in which both subgroups' resources began at the individual level was similar to a traditional public goods problem. Higher allocations to the collective account were found when the initial resource location was the same for both subgroups (vs different for each subgroup), even when this initial location was the subgroup or individual level. Implications for the social categorization processes providing a parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern of allocation are presented.

perspective-taking is a critical facilitator of shared understanding and
positive social interactions, such as collaboration. Yet there is
currently little understanding about how to reliably generate empathic
perspective-taking and collaboration, particularly in situations
involving the unequal distribution of environmental resources or power.
Here we examine how experiencing the loss or gain of social power
influenced empathic perspective-taking and behavior within a computer
mediated scenario. Participants (n = 180) were randomly assigned to each
condition: high resources, low resources, lose resources, gain
resources. Contrary to our expectations, participants in the
perspective-taking condition, specifically those who lost resources,
also lost perspective taking and exhibited egoistic behavior. This
finding suggests that resource control within the collaborative process
is a key contextual variable that influences perspective-taking and
collaborative behavior. Moreover, the observed relationship between
perspective-taking and egoistic behavior within a collaborative resource
sharing exercise suggests that when resource control or access is
unequal, interventions to promote perspective-taking deserve careful
consideration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000403736000021,,,{ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000403736000021},{EY1OU},{J. Environ. Manage.},{32},{0},{5},{76},"{The authors are grateful for support with data collection from A. Bhat

focussed on applying the process of decision making using emotions to
social dilemmas, notably the Prisoner's Dilemma. Previous work has
focussed on agents which do not move around, with an initial analysis on
how mobility and the environment can affect the decisions chosen.
Additionally simulated mood has been introduced to the decision-making
process. Exploring simulated emotions and mood to inform the
decision-making process in multi-agent systems allows us to explore in
further detail how outside influences can have an effect on different
strategies. We expand and clarify aspects of how agents are affected by
environmental differences. We show how emotional characters settle on an
outcome without deviation by providing a formal proof. We validate how
the addition of mood increases cooperation, while also showing how small
groups achieve this quicker than large groups. Once pure defectors are
added, to test the resilience of the cooperation achieved, we see that
while agents with a low starting mood achieve a payoff closest to the
pure defectors, they are reduced in numbers the most by the pure

Monetary versions of these games involve two players splitting an
arbitrary sum of money. In real life, however, people's propensity to
engage in cooperative behavior depends on their effort and contribution;
factors that are well known to affect perceptions of fairness. We
therefore sought to explore the impact of relative monetary
contributions by players in the UG and PD. Adapted computerized UG and
PD games, in which relative contributions from each player were
manipulated, were administered to 200 participants aged 18-50 years old
(50\% female). We found that players' contribution had large effects on
cooperative behavior. Specifically, cooperation was greater amongst
participants when their opponent had contributed more to joint earnings.
This was manifested as higher acceptance rates and higher offers in the
UG; and fewer defects in the PD compared to when the participant
contributed more. Interestingly, equal contributions elicited the
greatest sensitivity to fairness in the UG, and least frequent defection
in the PD. Acceptance rates correlated positively with anxiety and sex
differences were found in defection behavior. This study highlights the
feasibility of computerized games to assess cooperative behavior and the
importance of considering cooperation within the context of effortful

on large-scale cooperation, which is difficult to achieve because the
standard reciprocity mechanisms weaken in large groups. Here we
demonstrate a method by which reciprocity can maintain cooperation in a
large-scale public goods game (PGG). In a first experiment, participants
in groups of on average 39 people play one round of a Prisoner's Dilemma
(PD) with their two nearest neighbours on a cyclic network after each
PGG round. We observe that people engage in ``local-to-global{''}
reciprocity, leveraging local interactions to enforce global
cooperation: Participants reduce PD cooperation with neighbours who
contribute little in the PGG. In response, low PGG contributors increase
their contributions if both neighbours defect in the PD. In a control
condition, participants do not know their neighbours' PGG contribution
and thus cannot link play in the PD to the PGG. In the control we
observe a sharp decline of cooperation in the PGG, while in the
treatment condition global cooperation is maintained. In a second
experiment, we demonstrate the scalability of this effect: in a
1,000-person PGG, participants in the treatment condition successfully
sustain public contributions. Our findings suggest that this simple
``local-to-global{''} intervention facilitates large-scale cooperation.}",article,ISI:000386846800001,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted}",{ISI:000386846800001},{EA7XS},{Sci Rep},{19},{2},{17},{54},"{This work was supported by Office of Naval Research grant

participation in intergroup conflict by manipulating the perceived
target of threat-groups or individuals-and the symmetry of conflict. We
find that behavior in conflict depends on whether one is harmed by
actions perpetrated by the out-group, but not on one's own influence on
the outcome of the out-group. The perceived target of threat
dramatically alters decisions to participate in conflict. When people
perceive their group to be under threat, they are mobilized to do what
is good for the group and contribute to the conflict. On the other hand,
if people perceive to be personally under threat, they are driven to do
what is good for themselves and withhold their contribution. The first
phenomenon is attributed to group identity, possibly combined with a
concern for social welfare. The second phenomenon is attributed to a
novel victim effect. Another social motive-reciprocity-is ruled out by

University students participated in the study, and the factors of participation expectation, efficacy, message frame, and substitutability of the boycotted product were manipulated. Consumers' likelihood of participating in both economic and social-issue boycotts is jointly determined by their perceptions of the boycott's likelihood of success, their susceptibility to normative social influences, and the costs they incur in boycotting. Consumers' success perceptions are, in turn, determined by their expectations of overall participation and efficacy, as well as the message frame inherent in pro-boycott communications. 2 key determinants of consumers' boycotting costs are their preference for the boycotted product and their access to its substitutes. More specifically, consumers who are more susceptible to the normative influence exerted by the reference group of potential boycotters are more influenced by expected overall participation rates in their boycott likelihood.

The outcome of a social dilemma is contingent upon more than one person's behavior, whereas, the outcome of an individual dilemma is only contingent upon a single person's behavior over time. These experiments examined the effects of probability of reciprocation and the strategy used by an opponent on levels of cooperation during an individual and a social dilemma. Participants played a dilemma-type game with a computer that controlled the probability of reciprocation. However, for a third of the participants the probability of reciprocation was explicitly signaled, for another third the probability of reciprocation was not signaled, and the remaining third were led to believe that they were playing with another person. In Experiments 1 through 3 probability of reciprocation for both cooperation and defection was set to either 50%, 75%, or 100%. In Experiments 4 through 6 probability of reciprocation was independently set to either 50%, 75%, or 100% for cooperation and defection. The results of Experiments 1 through 6 found a strong positive correlation between probability of reciprocation and levels of cooperation, but this relationship was attenuated when participants believed they were playing another person. In Experiment 7 the computer used either a learning strategy (Pavlov) or a teaching strategy (TFT). When the computer used the learning strategy (Pavlov) it was more likely to repeat its previous choice (cooperate or defect) when a participant reinforced it by cooperating and it was more likely to switch from its previous choice when a participant punished it by defecting. When the computer used the teaching strategy (TFT) it was more likely to reinforce a participant for cooperating by also cooperating and to punish them for defecting by also defecting. Participants generally cooperated with both kinds of strategies when they played with the computer, but were more likely to cooperate at a high level when the computer played according to a learning strategy rather than a teaching strategy when they believed they were playing with another person. Conditions under which people are more likely to cooperate during individual and social dilemmas are discussed.

The first hypothesis was constructed in response to Schwartz-Shea and Simmon's (1995) criticism on the applicability of the framing concept to explain level of cooperation in public goods and resource dilemmas. It tested the possibility that cooperators may have adopted a different rationality from non-cooperators in a social dilemma situation. The second hypothesis was constructed to explain Cha's (1996) findings. It postulated that penalty sanction has failed to improve cooperation level significantly among the cooperators because cooperators, in contrast to non-cooperators, were not threatened by the sanction. Participants were asked to role-play students in financial difficulty who were offered financial assistance and found themselves in a social dilemma either to accumulate more funds for themselves or to conserve a common fund that was meant to help individuals in similar situations. The task was an iterated social dilemma, structured either as a GS (give-some) game that resembles a public goods dilemma or as a TS (take-some) game that resembles a commons dilemma. Two other factors that were investigated in the study were sanction and social value orientations. Several results inconsistent with previous studies were obtained, the most important of which was the failure to obtain a significant framing effect. Penalty sanction was found to be ineffective for all conditions, while reward sanction was effective only in a TS game but not in a GS game. The inconsistencies in results were traced to the addition of an expenditure factor that was originally intended to only add realism to the task. Implications for the unexpected results were discussed.

cooperation is rarely `all or nothing'. Recent models allowing for
variable investment in cooperation indicated the success of a strategy
of,raising-the-stakes' (RTS), which invests minimally at first and then
increases its investment if its partner matches it. We tested whether
this strategy was adopted by subjects participating in an experiment in
which they could choose how much money to give to a partner, reciprocity
being encouraged by doubling donations. Subjects did increase their
donations over successive rounds, both when playing against a stooge who
reciprocated with the same investment, and when playing with a partner
who was free to choose their investment. Subjects showed a strong
tendency to match variations in their partner's investments. Cooperation
was therefore achieved through a combination of initial escalation (RTS
strategy) and quantitative responsiveness ('give-as-good-as-you-get'
strategy). Although initial offers were higher than predicted, our
results were broadly consistent with theoretical expectations.}",article,ISI:000186630800011,{1530},,{ROYAL SOC},,,{2020-11-05},{Green Published},{ISI:000186630800011},{744KZ},{Proc. R. Soc. B-Biol.

The aim of this study is to evaluate cooperation problems
in antisocial disorder with the prisoner's dilemma game, which, in
mathematical game theory, is the paradigm of the <<non-zero>> games
(mutual benefit from cooperation).
Methods. We have designed a computer version of the prisoner's dilemma
(CDT-BD) that confronts the patient to a simulation of a reciprocal
exchange situation. IPDE provided us a categorical and dimensional
evaluation of 26 controls from the community and 40 methadone patients.
Only methadone patients obtained an antisocial diagnosis: 20 in the
category of positive antisocial and 10 in the probable antisocial
category. Patients also fullfilled TCI and MACH-IV.
Results. CDT-BD is, according to the parents opinion (mothers), a good
correlation of real life behavior CDT-BD shows a statistically
significant poorer cooperation of antisocial patients this is
categorical evaluation (versus in controls) and in dimensional
evaluation true both for variables that measure non-cooperation due to
the patient's initiative and those as a response to the computer
provocation. This may be due to a tendency of antisocials to use
interchange situations <<zero game>> strategies (you win what the other
player loses) instead of non-zero games strategies. Non-cooperative
responses are correlated to high scores on the MACH-IV scale
(manipulative behavior and cognition) and revengeful in Treatment and
Character Inventory (TCI).
Conclusions. CDT-BD allows us to generate and test new hypotheses on the
causes of the cooperation problems in antisocial patients using game
theory paradigms.}",article,ISI:000187413700001,{6},,{JUAN JOSE LOPEZ-IBOR FOUNDATION},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000187413700001},{755NC},{Actas Esp.

voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators.
We call this behavioral propensity ``strong reciprocity{''} and show
empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in
circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a
complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are
willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or
who defected in a Prisoner's Dilemma game with a third person. This
suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the
enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or
collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an
adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation
(in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect
reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection
theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.}",article,ISI:000176497800001,{1},,{SPRINGER},,,{2020-11-05},"{Green Published, Green Accepted}",{ISI:000176497800001},{567RD},{Hum.

individuals have the traits to punish the co-players based on social
tolerance. We show that a reasonable punishment with a uniform tolerance
can spur individuals to make more investments. Additionally, for a fixed
punishment cost and a fixed fine, a moderate value of tolerance can
result in the best promotion of cooperation. Furthermore, we investigate
the coevolutionary dynamics of investment and tolerance. We find that
the population splits into two branches: high-tolerance individuals who
make high investments and low-tolerance individuals who make low
investments. A dynamic equilibrium is achieved between these two types
of individuals. Our work extends punishment to continuous cooperative
behaviors and the results may enhance the understanding of altruistic
punishment in the evolution of human cooperation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

behavior in social settings. Upon initial contact, investment choices in
social settings can be inherently risky, as the degree to which the
other person will reciprocate is unknown. Nevertheless, people have been
shown to exhibit prosocial behavior even in one-shot laboratory settings
where all interaction has been taken away. A logical step has been to
link such behavior to trait empathy-related neurobiological networks.
However, as a social interaction unfolds, the degree of uncertainty with
respect to the expected payoff of choice behavior may change as a
function of the interaction. Here we attempt to capture this factor. We
show that the interpersonal tie one develops with another person during
interaction rather than trait empathy motivates investment in a public
good that is shared with an anonymous interaction partner. We examined
how individual differences in trait empathy and interpersonal ties
modulate neural responses to imposed monetary sharing. After, but not
before interaction in a public good game, sharing prompted activation of
neural systems associated with reward (striatum), empathy (anterior
insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) as well as altruism, and
social significance {[}posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)].
Although these activations could be linked to both empathy and
interpersonal ties, only tie-related pSTS activation predicted prosocial
behavior during subsequent interaction, suggesting a neural substrate
for keeping track of social relevance.}",article,ISI:000209165300044,,,{FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000209165300044},{V35RF},{Front. Neurosci.},{20},{0},{9},{58},,,"{Fahrenfort, Johannes/0000-0002-9025-3436

supports cultural group selection models of the evolution of large-scale
cooperation. However, these studies confound cultural and environmental
differences between populations by predominantly sampling one population
per society. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral variation
between populations is driven by environmental differences in demography
and ecology. We use a public goods game played with money and a
naturalistic measure of behavior involving the distribution of salt, an
essential and locally valued resource, to demonstrate significant
variation in levels of cooperation across 16 discrete populations of the
same small-scale society, the Pahari Korwa of central India. Variation
between these populations of the same cultural group is comparable to
that found between different cultural groups in previous studies.
Demographic factors partly explain this variation; age and a measure of
social network size are associated with contributions in the public
goods game, while population size and the number of adult sisters
residing in the population are associated with decisions regarding salt.
That behavioral variation is at least partly contingent on environmental
differences between populations questions the existence of stable norms
of cooperation. Hence, our findings call for reinterpretation of
cross-cultural data on cooperation. Although cultural group selection
could theoretically explain the evolution of large-scale cooperation,
our results make clear that existing cross-cultural data cannot be taken

fundamental building block of the natural world and human society. It
has been suggested that costly punishment can promote the evolution of
cooperation, with the threat of punishment deterring free-riders. Recent
experiments, however, have revealed the existence of `antisocial'
punishment, where non-cooperators punish cooperators. While various
theoretical models find that punishment can promote the evolution of
cooperation, these models a priori exclude the possibility of antisocial
punishment. Here we extend the standard theory of optional public goods
games to include the full set of punishment strategies. We find that
punishment no longer increases cooperation, and that selection favours
substantial levels of antisocial punishment for a wide range of
parameters. Furthermore, we conduct behavioural experiments, showing
results consistent with our model predictions. As opposed to an
altruistic act that promotes cooperation, punishment is mostly a
self-interested tool for protecting oneself against potential

how individual-scale variables (e.g., age, education, family size,
ethnicity, occupational status, personal norms), in the context of
village-scale variables (e.g., village, governance institutions, group
coercive action), influence cooperative behavior, as indexed by game
contribution. Ostrom's framework provides an effective window for
conceptually peeling back the various socio-economic and governance
layers which influence cooperation within these communities. The results
of our research show that the most important resource user
characteristics influencing cooperative behavior were age, occupation
and beliefs about giving access to others to fish for commercial gain.

We compare communication about private information to communication
about actions in a one-shot 2-person public good game with private
information. The informed player, who knows the exact return from
contributing and whose contribution is unobserved, can send a message
about the return or her contribution. Theoretically, messages can elicit
the uninformed player's contribution, and allow the informed player to
free-ride. The exact language used is not expected to matter.
Experimentally, however, we find that free-ride depends on the language:
the informed player free-rides less-and thereby lies less
frequently-when she talks about her contribution than when she talks
about the return. Further experimental evidence indicates that it is the
promise component in messages about the contribution that leads to less
free-ride and less lying.}",article,ISI:000324310200009,{5},,{OXFORD UNIV PRESS},,,{2020-11-04},,{ISI:000324310200009},{216UK},{J. Eur. Econ. Assoc.},{18},{0},{14},{45},,,"{Serra-Garcia, Marta/0000-0002-5875-4986

activity and relations. Evidence suggests that cooperation has direct
and indirect benefits for the cooperators. Given how beneficial
cooperation is overall, it seems relevant to investigate the various
ways of enhancing individuals' willingness to invest in cooperative
endeavors. We studied whether ascription of a transparent collective
goal in a joint action promotes cooperation in a group.
Methods: A total of 48 participants were assigned in teams of 4
individuals to either a ``transparent goal-ascription'' or an ``opaque
goal-ascription'' condition. After the manipulation, the participants
played an anonymous public goods game with another member of their team.
We measured the willingness of participants to cooperate and their
expectations about the other player's contribution.
Results: Between subjects analyses showed that transparent goal
ascription impacts participants' likelihood to cooperate with each other
in the future, thereby greatly increasing the benefits from social
interactions. Further analysis showed that this could be explained with
a change in expectations about the partner's behavior and by an
emotional alignment of the participants.
Conclusion: The study found that a transparent goal ascription is
associated with an increase of cooperation. We propose several
high-level mechanisms that could explain the observed effect: general
affect modulation, trust, expectation and perception of collective
efficacy.}",article,ISI:000319330200165,{5},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-04},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000319330200165},{149OK},{PLoS One},{19},{0},{11},{33},"{The study was conducted at the Department of Culture and Society and was

as well as prosocial or selfish social preferences in a repeated social
dilemma game framed around shared electricity use at home. We explore
the proposal that for sustained cooperation, guilty repair needs to
override angry retaliation. We show that anger is damaging to
cooperation as it leads to retaliation and an increase of defection,
while, through guilt, cooperation is repaired resulting in higher levels
of cooperation. We demonstrate a disconnect between the experience of
anger and subsequent retaliation which is a function of participants'
social preferences. While there is no difference in reports of anger
between prosocial and selfish individuals after finding out that others
use more energy from the communal resource, prosocials are less likely
to act on their anger and retaliate. Selfish individuals are motivated
by anger to retaliate but not motivated by guilt to repair and

investigate the role of exogenous and endogenous rules in irrigation
systems. The hypotheses we examine argue that despite the differences
between socio-economic and political settings, (1) endogenous
rule-crafting can help water users to overcome appropriation and
provision dilemmas in water-scarce environments like in the East
Mediterranean countries and that (2) in market-like water governance
systems, institutions other than the market itself, are less influential
for overcoming appropriation and provision dilemmas than in hybrid
governance systems. These hypotheses are being tested comparing the
results of field experiments conducted in Jordan, the Republic of Cyprus
and North Cyprus with 70 farmers. Field experiments simulate asymmetric
access to resources and are based on variations of the irrigation game
by Cardenas et al. to model and test asymmetric distribution of
investment, harvest and revenue that favours upstream users. Empirical
evidence shows that externally imposed allocation rules are able to
bring in more equal distribution of revenue among upstream-downstream
users but is likely to reduce the volume of investment and revenue,
without resolving issues of free-riding. The authors argue that given
the opportunity, water users (small farmers in our experiments) are able
to craft their own rules improving the overall performance of the group
in terms of investment and revenue, with a parallel improvement of
equity in distribution. The implications and policy relevance of such
findings are briefly discussed as they contradict typical practices of

of the distribution of initial endowments. Skewness is a measure of the
asymmetry of the distribution of endowments around the mean. We argue
that skewness reflects the social distance between `elite' players with
high initial endowments and other players with lower endowments, better
than variance and concentration measures like the Gini-coefficient. We
hypothesize that elite players become more selfish with increasing
skewness and therefore contribute less to a public good in the framework
of a one-shot non-linear public good game. The results of an
experimental test, in which we systematically vary the distribution of
endowments between treatments, confirm that the model is able to
correctly explain the observed pattern of contribution behavior. We find
that cooperation and efficiency are lowest with right-skewed
distribution of endowments. Our paper therefore improves the
understanding of the behavioral link between inequality and efficiency.

an experiment with two linked treatments to test how the presence of
impure public goods affects behaviour towards public good causes. We set

of the impure public good is behaviourally irrelevant. In a treatment
where the impure public good provides only small contributions to the
public good, we observe that on aggregate pro-social behaviour is lower

treatment where the impure public good is more generous towards the
public good component at the expense of private earnings, individuals
are unaffected in their behaviour. We observe that impure public goods,
that are theoretically irrelevant and are mostly self-interested, may
hinder pro-social behaviour and look for explanations in social
psychology, such as the phenomenon of thoughtful anchoring, motivated
reasoning and reluctant altruism. The results from this experiment

question, we collected experimental evidence from 1110 subjects playing

a positive and significant group size effect: Increasing group size by a

arose at the intensive margin and with repetition. Those who contributed
contributed more in larger groups. Larger and smaller groups had similar
initial contribution levels, but cooperation rates declined more slowly

human social interaction has increased within recent years. This study
tested the hypothesis that higher levels of cooperation would be
associated with increased genetic relatedness between interactants, and
explored questions concerning the expression of cooperative behavior
over time. A Prisoner's Dilemma game, in which participants elect to
display cooperative, competitive, or exploitative behaviors relative to
a partner, was administered to 59 monozygotic and 37 dizygotic twin
pairs, between 10.92 and 82.67 years of age. Results from multivariate
analysis of variance procedures, cross-lag sequential analyses, and
hierarchical linear modeling supported associations between zygosity,
and frequency and continuity of cooperation. Mechanisms by which
zygosity may affect cooperation were explored by examining relationships
between response combinations, and twins' IQ similarity and social
closeness. The findings are considered with reference to an evolutionary
perspective on behavior that offers a theoretical basis for considering
how the relative genetic relatedness of social partners affects their
social-interactional processes and outcomes. This report is the first in
a series of studies designed to address mechanisms underlying
differences in cooperation among pairs who vary in average genetic

predictions differ depending on the players' capacity to remember

strategies increased when games of Memory interfered with the subjects'

As social distance decreases, both samples converge to insignificantly different averages of contribution.

We vary whether the letters include the message, 'We may call you after the election to ask about your voting experience.'

In Chapter 1, 'Green, Greener, Greenest: Eco-label Gradation and Competition' I examine two common features of markets in which eco-label programs certify that products are 'green': gradation---single programs offering multiple certification standards (e.g., platinum, gold, silver)---and competition---multiple programs vying to certify to their respective standards. I find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry groups, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. For each of the cases examined, my analysis is consistent with casual empirical evidence. In Chapter 2, 'Is Ignorance Bliss? Information Avoidance and Private Provision of Public Goods', I investigate how information should be provided, and how individuals' information preferences can affect their private provision of public goods. I build a theoretical model that delivers several key findings: (1) Even if complete information about how much their efforts contribute to the public good can be acquired costlessly, individuals may still choose to avoid such information; (2) If policymakers are unaware of such behavior, they may adopt policies that yield suboptimal provision of public goods; (3) Forcing such information on individuals may yield a coordination failure, resulting in suboptimal public good provision and decreased welfare. In Chapter 3, 'An Experimental Test of Willingness-to-Pay for the Resolution of Uncertainty', I conduct an economic experiment to examine whether people's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an environmental public good can be affected by the timing and degree of uncertainty resolution. We extend conventional expected utility theory by combining anticipatory-utility-theory framework and neuroeconomic findings. I derive two sets of predictions about people's WTP under different information treatments using conventional expected utility theory and anticipatory utility theory. The experiment results are more consistent with anticipatory utility theory.

Building on general dual process theory of higher cognition and using a unique dataset of 276 Dutch business school students, we find that students are more inclined to free ride in a foreign language setting than in a native language setting. A student's conscientiousness attenuates this relationship such that this effect is stronger for students who are less conscientious, and weaker and almost absent for those who are more conscientious. After a student decides not to free ride but to positively contribute to the group, the specific level of contribution is not affected by foreign language.

However, positive peer influence effects are not yet well understood. The present fMRI study tested a novel hypothesis, by examining neural correlates of prosocial peer influence on donation decisions in adolescence. Participants (age 12–16 years; N = 61) made decisions in anonymous groups about the allocation of tokens between themselves and the group in a public goods game. Two spectator groups of same-age peers—in fact youth actors—were allegedly online during some of the decisions. The task had a within-subjects design with three conditions: (1) Evaluation: spectators evaluated decisions with likes for large donations to the group, (2) Spectator: spectators were present but no evaluative feedback was displayed and (3) Alone: no spectators nor feedback. Results showed that prosocial behavior increased in the presence of peers, and even more when participants received evaluative feedback from peers. Peer presence resulted in enhanced activity in several social brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus and superior temporal sulcus. TPJ activity correlated with donations, which suggests similar networks for prosocial behavior and sensitivity to peers. These findings highlight the importance of peers in fostering prosocial development throughout adolescence.

Nonetheless, the question of how social identity affects negative reciprocity in identity-homogeneous and -heterogeneous groups has only received little attention. Consequently, we seek to fill this gap by examining whether social identity affects individuals’ willingness to sanction deviating group members in a public good context. Moreover, we devote particular attention to the role of anger-like emotions in negative reciprocity. To test our hypotheses, we employ one-shot public good games in a strategy method with punishment opportunity and induced social identity. Our results indicate that members of identity-homogeneous groups are prone to reveal less negative reciprocity than identity-heterogeneous groups when they face contributions smaller than their own. We also find that anger-like emotions much more strongly influence punishment behavior when individuals are matched with members of different identities than in identity-homogenous groups. These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the nature of social identity and its impact on reciprocity, improving economists’ ability to predict behavior while taking emotions into consideration.

One conjecture is that if the redistribution mechanism is perceived as positive by the taxpayers, this leads them to comply with the tax laws more truthfully. In contrast, for a negative perception, lower tax compliance is expected. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study systematically analyzing these effects. To fill this gap, we conduct a laboratory experiment and analyze how the redistribution of tax revenues influences tax compliance behavior by applying different reward mechanisms. In our experiment, subjects have to make two decisions. In the first stage, subjects decide on the contribution to a public good. In the second stage, subjects declare their income from the first stage for taxation. Our main results are threefold: First, from an aggregated perspective, rewards have a negative overall effect on tax compliance. Second, we observe that rewards affect the decision of taxpayers asymmetrically. In particular, rewards have either no effect (for those who are rewarded) or a negative effect (for those who are not rewarded) on tax compliance. Thus, if a high compliance rate of taxpayers is preferred, rewards should not be used by the tax authority. Third, we find an inverse u-shaped relationship between public good contribution and tax compliance. In particular, up to a certain level, tax compliance increases with subjects’ own contributions to the public good. Above this level, however, tax compliance decreases with the public good contribution.

evolutionary biology {[}1-3]. It is particularly a problem in species
such as humans, where there is cooperation between nonrelatives.
Numerous possible solutions have been suggested for the problem of

various forms of reciprocity {[}3-14]. Here, we suggest that local
competition for resources can pose a problem for these hypotheses,
analogous to how it can select against cooperation between relatives
{[}15-21]. We extend the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game to show that local
competition between interacting individuals can reduce selection for
cooperation between nonrelatives. This is because, with local
competition, fitness is relative to social partners, and cooperation
benefits social partners. We then test whether nonrelated humans adjust
their level of cooperation facultatively in response to the scale of
competition when playing the PD for cash prizes. As predicted, we found
that individuals were less likely to cooperate when competition was
relatively local. Cooperation between humans will therefore be most
likely when repeated interactions take place on a local scale between
small numbers of people, and competition for resources takes place on a
more global scale among large numbers of people.}",article,ISI:000238245900023,{11},,{CELL PRESS},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000238245900023},{052PP},{Curr. Biol.},{34},{1},{86},{44},,"{Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research

large-scale cooperation evolves via selection acting on populations
among which behavioural variation is maintained by the cultural
transmission of cooperative norms. These models assume that individuals
acquire cooperative strategies via social learning. This assumption
remains empirically untested. Here, I test this by investigating whether
individuals employ conformist or payoff-biased learning in public goods
games conducted in 14 villages of a forager-horticulturist society, the
Pahari Korwa of India. Individuals did not show a clear tendency to
conform or to be payoff-biased and are highly variable in their use of
social learning. This variation is partly explained by both individual
and village characteristics. The tendency to conform decreases and to be
payoff-biased increases as the value of the modal contribution
increases. These findings suggest that the use of social learning in

Lenka and Flegr, Jaroslav","{Background: Allowing players to punish their opponents in Public Goods
Game sustains cooperation within a group and thus brings advantage to
the cooperative individuals. However, the possibility of punishment of
the co-players can result in antisocial punishment, the punishment of
those players who contribute the most in the group. To better understand
why antisocial punishment exists, it must be determined who are the
anti-social punishers and who are their primary targets.
Methods: For resolving these questions we increased the number of
players in a group from usual four to twelve. Each group played six
rounds of the standard Public Goods Game and six rounds of the Public
Goods Game with punishment. Each player in each round received 20 CZK
(\$ 1.25). Players (N=118) were rematched after each round so that they
would not take into consideration opponents' past behavior.
Results: The amount of the punishment received correlated negatively
with the contribution (p= -0.665, p<0.001). However, this correlation
was positive for players in the highest contributors-quartile (p =0.254,
p<0.001). Therefore, the graph of relation between the contribution
given and punishment obtained was U-shaped (R-2=0.678, p<0.001) with the
inflection point near the left boarder of the upper quartile. The
antisocial punishment was present in all groups, and in eight out of ten
groups the Justine Effect (the positive correlation between the
contribution to the public pool and the risk of suffering punishment in
the subpopulation of altruistic players) emerged. In our sample, 22.5\%
subjects, all of them Free riders and low contributors, punished the
altruistic players.
Conclusions: The results of our experimental game-study revealed the
existence of the Justine effect - the positive correlation between the

Building on previous research, I develop a justice theory that explains how framing social comparisons in particular ways will make actors more or less sensitive and reactive to departures from fair contributions. In turn, this is predicted to impact justice-restoring behaviors such as reducing subsequent contributions to a public good, punishing group members, or exiting the group. This integrated theory shows how varying the way key pieces of information are framed affects fairness perceptions and subsequent behaviors in social dilemma settings as well as a broader contribution and/or reward settings. By integrating theories of distributive justice and literature on framing the following dissertation aims to better understand the perceptual, emotional, and behavioral effects of socially constructed frames on behavior public goods dilemma situations. The proposed theory is mathematically formalized and utilized to generate logically connected assumptions and derivations. The key terms, assumptions, and derivations are operationalized through the testable hypotheses aiming to measure variations in justice evaluations and justice restoring behaviors across different theoretical conditions. The hypotheses are tested in a hypothetical vignette and a standard laboratory-based public goods setting.

cooperation emerges in a population of self-interested individuals,
researchers recently pay intensive attentions to the role altruistic
punishment plays. However, as higher-order cooperators, survival of
punishers is puzzling due to their extra cost in regulating norm
violators. Previous works have highlighted the importance of individual
mobility in promoting cooperation. Yet its effect on punishers remains
to be explored. In this work we incorporate this feature into modeling
the behavior of punishers, who are endowed with a choice between leaving
current place or staying and punishing defectors. Results indicate that
optimal mobility level of punishers is closely related to the cost of
punishing. For considerably large cost, there exists medium tendency of
migration which favors the survival of punishers. This holds for both
the direct competition between punishers and defectors and the case
where cooperators are involved, and can also be observed when various
types of punishers with different mobility tendencies fight against
defectors simultaneously. For cheap punishment, mobility does not
provide with punishers more advantage even when they are initially rare.
We hope our work provide more insight into understanding the role
individual mobility plays in promoting public cooperation.}",article,ISI:000413700200054,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000413700200054},{FK7PS},{Sci Rep},{19},{0},{10},{63},"{The authors are supported by National Key Research and Development

companies increasingly promote their products and services by engaging
in charitable giving and policy makers increasingly push for the
implementation of market-driven prosocial initiatives. However, this
trend has occurred without being informed by evidence on how the market
influences individuals' engagement in prosocial behavior. Using a public
goods game that simulates a market and a non-market context, we analyze
prosocial behavior and its psychological underpinnings across these two
contexts. First, we find that prosocial behavior occurs at lower levels
in markets than non-markets. Second, we find that individuals' beliefs
about prosocial norms are more important for prosocial behavior in
markets than non-markets, while the opposite is true for their
autonomous motivation towards prosocial behavior. This suggests that
decision-makers need to adjust the means to foster prosocial behavior,

societies remains a central question of both theoretical and practical
importance. In the laboratory, experimental behavioural research using
tools like public goods games suggests that cooperation can be sustained
by institutional punishment-analogous to governments, police forces and
other institutions that sanction free-riders on behalf of individuals in
large societies(1-3). In the real world, however, corruption can
undermine the effectiveness of these institutions(4-8). Levels of
corruption correlate with institutional, economic and cultural factors,
but the causal directions of these relationships are difficult to
determine(5,6,8-10). Here, we experimentally model corruption by
introducing the possibility of bribery. We investigate the effect of
structural factors (a leader's punitive power and economic potential),
anti-corruption strategies (transparency and leader investment in the
public good) and cultural background. The results reveal that (1)
corruption possibilities cause a large (25\%) decrease in public good
provisioning, (2) empowering leaders decreases cooperative contributions
(in direct opposition to typical institutional punishment results), (3)
growing up in a more corrupt society predicts more acceptance of bribes
and (4) anti-corruption strategies are effective under some conditions,
but can further decrease public good provisioning when leaders are weak
and the economic potential is poor. These results suggest that a more
nuanced approach to corruption is needed and that proposed panaceas,
such as transparency, may actually be harmful in some contexts.}",article,ISI:000418779800015,{7},,{NATURE RESEARCH},,,{2020-11-06},{Green Accepted},{ISI:000418779800015},{FR0US},{Nat. Hum. Behav.},{42},{11},{16},{30},"{J.H. acknowledges support from the Canadian Institute for Advanced

used to construct a situation in which making a huge coalition is the

not pay punishment costs, reduce the effectiveness of punishment. Here
we introduce a ``leader support system,{''} in which one group leader
can freely punish group followers using capital pooled through the
support of group followers. In our experiment, participants engage in
three stages repeatedly: a PGG stage in which followers decide to
cooperate for their group; a support stage in which followers decide
whether to support the leader; and a punishment stage in which the
leader can punish any follower. We compare a support-present condition
with a no-support condition, in which there is an external source for
the leader's punishment. The results show that punishment occurs more
frequently in the support-present condition than the no-support
condition. Within the former, both higher cooperation and higher support
for a leader are achieved under linkage-type leaders-who punish both
non-cooperators and non-supporters. In addition, linkage-type leaders
themselves earn higher profits than other leader types because they
withdraw more support. This means that leaders who effectively punish
followers could increase their own benefits and the second-order free

point mechanism}",{JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS},{0047-2727},"Li, Zhi and Anderson, Christopher M. and Swallow, Stephen K.","{We introduce two novel mechanisms for provision point public goods,
motivated by the design of uniform price auctions: The uniform price
auction mechanism (UPA) collects an endogenously determined uniform
price from everyone offering at least that price, while the uniform
price cap mechanism (UPC) collects the uniform price from everyone
offering at least that price, plus the full offer of everyone offering
less. UPC has the same undominated perfect equilibria as standard
provision point (PPM) and proportional rebate (PR) mechanisms, and UPA a
somewhat broader set. However, our mechanisms' different marginal
penalty structures may facilitate equilibrium selection and lead to
higher contributions and more frequent provision. Through laboratory
experiments, using both homogeneous (symmetric) and heterogeneous
induced values, we show our mechanisms improve upon PR and PPM: UPC
generates higher aggregate contributions than PR and PPM, leading to
higher provision rates than PPM; UPA attracts much higher contributions,
although it provides less frequently. This ranking emerges because high
offers are more common (especially among high value people in the
heterogeneous environment) in the uniform price mechanisms, where higher
offers only increase the payment when needed for provision. (C) 2016

fishermen from the Mexican and Colombian Pacific. The experimental
design aims at studying behavior under uncertainty concerning the
possible effects of climate change on fisheries. We find that subjects'
risk-aversion diminishes the level of catches and changes fishing
practices (e.g. adopting marine reserves), provided that fishermen have
ex ante information on possible climatic consequences. Furthermore,
social preferences (e.g. for cooperation and reciprocity) also play an
important role regarding extraction from common-pool resources. Other
factors, such as income, gender and religion are also found to have some
influence. These results have important implications for adaptation
actions and the management of coastal fisheries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

others to contribute less to public goods, and become less risk averse.

are abundant. Our findings show that the change in trustworthiness
between the two trust game rounds generated by the CPRG experience is
crucially affected by the subjective satisfaction about the CPRG, rather
than by standard objective measures related to CPRG players' behaviour.

punishment are two key mechanisms to promote cooperation in groups, but
no behavioral research has yet examined their relative effectiveness and
efficiency in promoting and maintaining cooperation. To examine these
issues, we observed participants interacting in a four-round public
goods game (PGG) with or without gossip and punishment options, and a
subsequent two-round trust game (TG). We manipulated gossip as the
option to send notes about other group members to these members' future
partners, and punishment as the option to assign deduction points to
reduce other group members' outcomes with a fee-to-fine ratio of 1:3.
Findings revealed that in the four-round PGG, the option to gossip
increased both cooperation and individual earnings, whereas the option
to punish had no overall effect on cooperation (but a positive effect on
cooperation in the last two rounds of the PGG) and significantly
decreased individual earnings. Importantly, the initial option to gossip
made people more trusting and trustworthy in the subsequent TG when
gossip was no longer possible, compared to the no-gossip condition.
Thus, we provide some initial evidence that gossip may be more effective
and efficient than punishment to promote and maintain cooperation.}",article,ISI:000373254000002,,,{NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP},,,{2020-11-06},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000373254000002},{DI1KC},{Sci Rep},{47},{2},{30},{49},"{We thank China Scholarship Council (201206040030) in supporting part of

most readily when directed toward kin. Dispersal plays a controversial
role in the evolution of cooperation: dispersal decreases local
population relatedness and thus opposes the evolution of cooperation,
but limited dispersal increases kin competition and can negate the
benefits of cooperation. Theoretical work has suggested that plasticity
of dispersal, where individuals can adjust their dispersal decisions
according to the social context, might help resolve this paradox and
promote the evolution of cooperation. Here, we experimentally tested the
hypothesis that conditional dispersal decisions are mediated by a
cooperative strategy: we quantified the density-dependent dispersal
decisions and subsequent colonization efficiency from single cells or
groups of cells among six genetic strains of the unicellular Tetrahymena
thermophila that differ in their aggregation level (high, medium, and
low), a behavior associated with cooperation strategy. We found that the
plastic reaction norms of dispersal rate relative to density differed
according to aggregation level: highly aggregative genotypes showed
negative density-dependent dispersal, whereas low-aggregation genotypes
showed maximum dispersal rates at intermediate density, and
medium-aggregation genotypes showed density-independent dispersal with
intermediate dispersal rate. Dispersers from highly aggregative
genotypes had specialized long-distance dispersal phenotypes, contrary
to low-aggregation genotypes; medium-aggregation genotypes showing
intermediate dispersal phenotype. Moreover, highly aggregation genotypes
showed evidence for beneficial kin-cooperation during dispersal. Our
experimental results should help to resolve the evolutionary conflict
between cooperation and dispersal: cooperative individuals are expected
to avoid kin-competition by dispersing long distances, but maintain the
benefits of cooperation by dispersing in small groups.}",article,ISI:000385550700012,{10},,{WILEY},,,{2020-11-06},,{ISI:000385550700012},{DZ0ST},{Evolution},{38},{2},{18},{72},"{This study was supported by the ANR EVO-INF-ECOL and INDHET to S.J. and

impose a considerable amount of spiteful punishment on the cooperators.
However, spiteful punishment vanishes if the punishers can no longer

individual, whereas the cooperators even increase the resources devoted
to punishment in this case. Our data also discriminate between different
fairness principles. Fairness theories that are based on the assumption
that players compare their own payoff to the group's average or the
group's total payoff cannot explain the fact that cooperators target
their punishment at the defectors. Fairness theories that assume that
players aim to minimize payoff inequalities cannot explain the fact that
cooperators punish defectors even if payoff inequalities cannot be
reduced. Therefore, retaliation, i.e., the desire to harm those who
committed unfair acts, seems to be the most important motive behind

The Moodle forum provides spontaneous and simultaneous rich feedback from a larger number of students and increases their awareness of the complexity of the task.

The antecedents of cooperative and competitive behavior have been well studied using a particular class of problems called social dilemmas. Cultural variables, such as collectivism, are often thought to influence cooperative behavior in groups, but experimental evidence has seen mixed results. The current study attempts to add to our understanding of the effects of cultural variables on cooperative and competitive behavior in groups by advancing two major ideas: (1) that the Input-Process-Output (I-P-O) framework can be used as a conceptualization for understanding the impact of cultural variables on potential group outcomes, provided that a distinction is made between potentially meaningful but task-unrelated distal inputs such as collectivism and task-related proximal inputs, and (2) that group process can be indexed using variance components calculated from the Social Relations Model (SRM). Using two social dilemmas as experimental media, participants were placed in groups of four and asked to report what they expected each of their group members to do during the social dilemmas and how much they trusted each of their fellow group members. Results demonstrate that collectivism increases the tendency to expect similar behavior from fellow group members and to trust fellow group members at similar levels when given little diagnostic information. In turn, more competitive behavior is demonstrated in groups that have members who all expect similar behavior from each group member, but show variability regarding what the behavior will be. The study demonstrates (1) a significant relationship between collectivism and expectations of other group members' behavior, (2) expectations will synthesize into meaningful variance components as calculated using SRM, (3) SRM variance components serve as useful indicators of group process and, (4) SRM variance components can be used to predict cooperative and competitive behavior in social dilemma situations. This research demonstrates the value of using SRM variances as indices of process and underscores the theoretical utility of the I-P-O framework as an explanatory tool of group behavior.

Considering the economic and social significance of public goods dilemmas, an important research question is why public goods dilemmas often result in collective failure. This dissertation proposes an explanation and solution for this question. By way of explanation, public good dilemmas often result in collective failure because individuals perceive themselves as highly vulnerable to the uncertain behavior of others. The solution to this question is found in taking a real options approach to social dilemmas. The thesis of this dissertation is that, in social dilemmas, real options provide collectives opportunity to achieve small wins and small wins enable collective action by reducing perceived vulnerability. Real options allow individuals in social dilemmas to know they can trust their partners. If there is mutual cooperation when investing in the pilot project, then this mutual cooperation acts as a small win, and this small win increases trust. Increasing trust reduces uncertainty about what others will do, and this decrease in uncertainty minimizes perceived vulnerability. Because of reduced perceptions of vulnerability, individuals are more willing to contribute toward the public good. The effect of the pilot project on trust is moderated by an individual's exposure in the pilot project. When exposure is high, mutual cooperation is less likely, leading to a trust breach and collective-task failure, respectively decreasing a member's trust in the other members' intentions and belief in their ability to mobilize to collective action. When exposure is low, mutual cooperation is most likely; however, without 'enough vulnerability' among parties, high trust and efficacy beliefs are less likely to develop. This dissertation tests these hypotheses using a series of laboratory experiments. These experiments also provide theoretical elaboration on the role of several real option structures and outcome variance. The results show support for the proposed model and also offer theoretical and managerial implications for how real options should (not) be used to foster collective action.

Participants role-played managers for a simulated company with either a collectivistic or individualistic organizational culture in a computerized social-dilemma game.

More specifically, three experiments showed that if the other person displayed happiness he or she was perceived as honest, trustworthy, and reliable, and cooperation was increased when verbal communication was cooperative rather than self-interested. However, if the other person displayed anger, verbal communication did not influence people's decision behavior.

and learning in the evolution of cooperation in a public goods game
(PGG) in a well-mixed population. Individuals are endowed with a set of
strategies, and in every round of the game they use one strategy out of
this set based on their memory and learning process. The payoff of a
player using a given strategy depends on the public goods enhancement
factor r and the collective action of all players. We investigate the
distribution of used strategies as well as the distribution of
information patterns. The outcome depends on the learning process, which
can be dynamic or static. In the dynamic learning process, the players
can switch their strategies along the whole game, and use the strategy
providing the highest payoff at current time step. In the static
learning process, there is a training period where the players randomly
explore different strategies out of their strategy sets. In the rest of
the game, players only use the strategy providing the highest payoff
during the training period. In the dynamic learning process, we observe
a transition from a non-cooperative regime to a regime where the level
of cooperation reaches about 50\%. As in the standard PGG, in the static
learning process there is a transition from the non-cooperative regime
to a regime where the level of cooperation can be higher than 50\% at r
= N. In both learning processes the transition becomes smoother as the
memory size of individuals increases, which means that the lack of
information is a key ingredient causing the defection. (C) 2015 Elsevier

characteristics of participants. We examined the occurrence of punishing
behavior among 80 subjects in a strongly competitive Public Goods game

punishment takes on. Subjects punished each other in order to achieve a
higher rank and a financially better outcome. Punishment primarily
functioned as a means of rivalry, instead of as a way of second-order

is associated with changes in economic decision making, including, for
example, increased prosocial tendencies. We investigated the generality
of age effects in social and nonsocial domains by assessing various
measures of economic decision making in a rural population from Morocco.
Method. We measured age/cohort differences using a number of economic
games (risk game, time preferences game, dictator game, trust game, and
public goods game) in over 700 participants ranging from 17 to 92 years
of age.
Results. The results suggest a negative relation between age and risk
taking and a concave relation between age and contribution to a public
good, but no significant age trends in time preferences, altruism,
trust, or trustworthiness.
Discussion. Our results indicate that the relationship between aging and
decision making is not universal and is shaped by local culture and the
type of task rather than biological factors alone. More research is
needed to understand the unique age trends prevalent in specific

or desires of others is highly advantageous. Increasingly, humans also
interact with computers or robots. In this study, we sought to determine
to what degree an interactive task, which involves receiving feedback
from social partners that can be used to infer intent, engaged the
medial prefrontal cortex, a region previously associated with Theory of
Mind processes among others. Participants were scanned using fMRI as
they played an adapted version of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game with
alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. The
medial frontal cortex was activated when both human and computer partner
were played, while the direct contrast revealed significantly stronger
signal change during the human-human interaction. The results suggest a
link between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and the partner
played in a mentalising task. This signal change was also present for to
the computers partner. Implying agency or a will to non-human actors
might be an innate human resource that could lead to an evolutionary
advantage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}",article,ISI:000265275500002,{3},,{ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD},,,{2020-11-05},,{ISI:000265275500002},{434LF},{Neurosci. Lett.},{19},{0},{48},{37},"{The study was supported by a grant from the Interdisciplinary Centre for

it were a human being. Why and under which circumstances do we attribute
human-like properties to machines? Although humans increasingly interact
directly with machines it remains unclear whether humans implicitly
attribute intentions to them and, if so, whether such interactions
resemble human-human interactions on a neural level. In social cognitive
neuroscience the ability to attribute intentions and desires to others
is being referred to as having a Theory of Mind (ToM). With the present
study we investigated whether an increase of human-likeness of
interaction partners modulates the participants' ToM associated cortical
activity.
Methodology/Principal Findings: By means of functional magnetic
resonance imaging (subjects n = 20) we investigated cortical activity
modulation during highly interactive human-robot game. Increasing
degrees of human-likeness for the game partner were introduced by means
of a computer partner, a functional robot, an anthropomorphic robot and
a human partner. The classical iterated prisoner's dilemma game was
applied as experimental task which allowed for an implicit detection of
ToM associated cortical activity. During the experiment participants
always played against a random sequence unknowingly to them.
Irrespective of the surmised interaction partners' responses
participants indicated having experienced more fun and competition in
the interaction with increasing human-like features of their partners.
Parametric modulation of the functional imaging data revealed a highly
significant linear increase of cortical activity in the medial frontal
cortex as well as in the right temporo-parietal junction in
correspondence with the increase of human-likeness of the interaction
partner (computer<functional robot<anthropomorphic robot<human).
Conclusions/Significance: Both regions correlating with the degree of
human-likeness, the medial frontal cortex and the right temporo-parietal
junction, have been associated with Theory-of-Mind. The results
demonstrate that the tendency to build a model of another's mind
linearly increases with its perceived human-likeness. Moreover, the
present data provides first evidence of a contribution of higher human
cognitive functions such as ToM in direct interactions with artificial
robots. Our results shed light on the long-lasting psychological and
philosophical debate regarding human-machine interaction and the
question of what makes humans being perceived as human.}",article,ISI:000264065800010,{7},,{PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE},,,{2020-11-05},"{DOAJ Gold, Green Published}",{ISI:000264065800010},{417GZ},{PLoS One},{38},{1},{147},{61},"{This work has been supported by the EU funded IP-project COGNIRON, the

situation construal, and person perception. Previous research on priming
and person perception has generally neglected the situational context.
We predicted that when rich situational information is included, primed
constructs can lead to assimilation effects on situation construals,
which can in turn lead to contrast effects in person perceptions. Study
1 demonstrated that when situation information is included in the
experimental context, primes lead to contrast in person perceptions.
Study 2, employing a subliminal methodology, demonstrated that these
effects could not be accounted for via previous explanations of contrast
effects, such as correction-based mechanisms, that require overt
recognition of the priming stimuli by the participants. Study 3
demonstrated that the contrastive effects of the priming stimuli on
person perception obtained in Studies 1 and 2 are in fact due to the
intervening assimilative effects of the priming stimuli on situation
construal-that is, the primed constructs led to contrast effects on
perceptions of the actor via their assimilative effects on perceptions
of the situation in which that actor was embedded. Additionally,
moderator variables demonstrated that this effect is most pronounced
when the target actor's behavior is described as relatively unambiguous
or situation focus is increased. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

ongoing debate whether individuals have therefore developed a general

spontaneous cooperation effect, although contrary results have also been

person x situation interaction, in that there is a spontaneous
cooperation effect for prosocial but not for proself persons. In three
studies, one involving population representative samples from the US and
Germany, we found that cooperation in a public good game is dependent on
an interaction between individuals' social value orientation and
decision time. Increasing deliberation about the dilemma situation does
not affect persons that are selfish to begin with, but it is related to
decreasing cooperation for prosocial persons that gain positive utility
from outcomes of others and score high on the related general
personality trait honesty/humility. Our results demonstrate that the
spontaneous cooperation hypothesis has to be qualified in that it is
limited to persons with a specific personality and social values.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes
Nature of problem: Predicting the crystal structure of a system from its
stoichiometry alone remains a grand challenge in computational materials
science, chemistry, and physics.
Solution method: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search
techniques that use concepts from biological evolution to search for the
global minimum (or a good approximation for it) in a multidimensional
problem. Applied to a priori crystal structure prediction, EAs search to
find atomic arrangements that correspond to stable (low energy or
enthalpy) regions of the chemical structure's potential energy
landscape. The XTALOPT evolutionary algorithm is available for use and
collaboration under the GNU Public License, which is an open-source
license that is officially recognized by the Open Source Initiative
{[}16]. See the publication on XTALOPT'S original implementation {[}17]
and previous version announcement {[}18] for more information on the
method.
Reasons for new version: Since the release of XTALOPT version r7 in May
2011 various bug-fixes have been made, along with the addition of
several new features:
Added support for the LSF and LoadLeveler queuing systems.
Added support for the SIESTA program package {[}10].
Incorporated the XTALCOMP {[}19] library for duplicate structure removal
(niching).
Added the ``mitosis{''} function, which increases the local order of
structures in the initial generation by replicating a unit cell to
create a supercell for constructing the starting structure.
Customizable polling interval for updating remote queue information.
Automatic removal of remote working files (optional).
Optional removal of unnecessary files for VASP calculations.
Option to rank all current structures and export structures to a new
subdirectory as.cml, CONTCAR, or.got. o New option to replace a failing
structure with a new offspring.
Ability to ``inject{''} (seed) a structure mid-run. o Minimum atomic
separation now specified as a fraction of the sum of atomic radii, with
a hard minimum.
Set a final number of structures to be generated before termination of
the search.
Changing the minimum and maximum cell vectors now directly influences
the minimum and maximum volume for the cell.
Implemented an extension for an automated stochastic docking program
(RANDOMDOCK {[}20]) that supports MOPAC {[}11], ADF {[}12], GAMESS
{[}13] and Gaussian {[}14] as back-end molecular quantum chemistry
engines.
Submission of remote calculations is throttled to ease DRMS load.
More server-friendly method of fetching queue data.
Support for GULP shell/core calculations added.
Fix compilation against Qt 4.6.3 and 4.8.0.
Updated space-group detection library to spglib 1.0.8.
Bundled libssh library removed, now an optional dependency.
Added option to use command-line ssh/scp interfaces when libssh is

This article contributes to the understanding of the behavioral
implications of PSM by investigating whether PSM is associated with
prosocial behavior. Moreover, it addresses whether and how the behavior
of other group members influences this relationship. The article uses
the experimental setting of the public goods game, run with a sample of
263 students, in combination with survey-based PSM measures. A positive
link is found between PSM and prosocial behavior. This relationship is
moderated by the behavior of other group members: high-PSM people act
even more prosocially when the other members of the group show prosocial
behavior as well, but they do not do so if the behavior of other group
members is not prosocial.}",article,ISI:000367313700027,{1},,{WILEY},,,{2020-11-06},{Green Accepted},{ISI:000367313700027},{CZ7XK},{Public Adm. Rev.},{88},{6},{43},{59},,,"{Urbig, Diemo/0000-0002-8899-9722

written feedback messages on the resource extraction behavior of
participants sharing a common-pool whereby participants are physically

application of a three-member common-pool resources (CPR) game. The
members of the groups sharing the CPR were changed periodically and were
allowed to talk briefly to each other so that an experienced participant
could give instructions to a newcomer. In this way, it was also possible
to evaluate how the accuracy of instructions regarding resource
preservation and sustainability affects group member resource extraction
patterns and CPR maintenance in the long run. Twenty-two college
students took part and were distributed into three groups: Control,
Display, and Feedback. The amount of resources extracted individually
and by the groups in every round of the game was analyzed, as were the
verbal responses of the experienced participants when giving
instructions to newcomers. Results showed that the manipulated variables
were effective for the short-term decrease in the amount of resources
extracted by the members of the Display and Feedback groups. The
accuracy of the instructions was also important for the sustained
maintenance of the pattern of consumption established by the manipulated
variables, leading to the recovery and the preservation of the resources

to remember when seeking equilibrium in the non-cooperative models that
in the Nash Equilibrium (which is sought in this study) the parties try
to come up with the best response to the opponent?s decision. The aim of
the paper is to present the Nash Equilibrium in a non-cooperative game

model of a fiscal-monetary game (a policy-mix MODEL). This study
demonstrates that in the Nash Equilibrium in the model, the budget
deficit and interest rate of an EU member state depend on the exogenous

cooperative TU games. A procedural value is determined by an underlying
procedure of sharing marginal contributions to coalitions formed by
players joining in random order. We consider procedures under which
players can only share their marginal contributions with their
predecessors in the ordering, and study the set of all resulting values.
The most prominent procedural value is, of course, the Shapley value
obtaining under the simplest procedure of every player just retaining
his entire marginal contribution. But different sharing rules lead to
other interesting values, including the ``egalitarian solution{''} and
the Nowak and Radzik ``solidarity value{''}. All procedural values are
efficient, symmetric and linear. Moreover, it is shown that these
properties together with two very natural monotonicity postulates
characterize the class of procedural values. Some possible modifications
and generalizations are also discussed. In particular, it is shown that
dropping one of monotonicity axioms is equivalent to allowing for
sharing marginal contributions with both predecessors and successors in
the ordering.}",article,ISI:000314505500015,{1},,{SPRINGER HEIDELBERG},,,{2020-11-05},{Other Gold},{ISI:000314505500015},{083ZL},{Int. J.

It was hypothesized that the conditions of responding would affect the size of the self-serving bias in at least some of the performance determinants. Ss played in competitive matrix games, the outcomes of which were manipulated so that half of the Ss won and the other half lost. Each S was then asked to report, either to the experimenter or anonymously, the role of his own ability, effort, the task difficulty, and luck in determining his own outcome. Under both conditions of responding, a self-serving bias was found for the Ss' attributions of ability and effort. For attributions to luck, however, conditions of responding interacted with competition outcome so that the egocentric bias was found under anonymous conditions and a self-effacing bias under public conditions.

Although gender had no effect on competitive behavior in matrix games or on tension and satisfaction in small groups discussing these games, masculine, feminine, and androgynous sex-roles as indexed by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory significantly influenced these behaviors and attitudes. With the exception of tension releases, which are conceptually somewhat ambiguous, androgynous Ss were lowest in tension and highest in satisfaction. A follow-up experiment using all female Ss reproduced these results and also showed that masculine females were high in tension and dissatisfaction. It is suggested that the advantages of role-accumulation experienced by androgynous Ss may result because the roles are internalized, and therefore, may be transferred easily from 1 situation to another.

The survey data showed that respondents who saw civil rights tactics as violent (immoral) saw them as self-defeating, while those who saw them as peaceful (moral) saw them as useful. In the experiment, Ss were exposed to 1 of 2 2-person matrix games and were asked to specify the economically optimal strategy. The 2 games had the same strategic structure but different equitable choices. In one set of conditions Ss thought both players were people (hence equity should be regarded as morally required), while in the other set, Ss thought one player was a computer (here equity should be morally irrelevant). Results show that as predicted, (a) in the person conditions, the equitable strategy was regarded as more economically rational; (b) in the computer conditions, equity had no influence on the Ss' assessment of the economically rational strategy.
